Barcelona took the opportunity of the open window to register Vitor Roque, handing him the no. 19 shirt. Any new signings after the Brazilian look unlikely. But here are a few things Barca could do before the window closes. Sign a midfielder on loan Xavi has reportedly told the higher-ups at Barcelona that he needs a midfielder to cover the void left by Gavi's injury. Players like Kalvin Phillips, Giovani Lo Celso and Aleix Garcia have all been looked at but as it stands unless there's an opportunity to sign such players on loan simply won't happen. Romano reveals truth on Barca's interest in Kalvin PhillipsBarcelona sporting director Deco recently said Barca simply doesn't have the FFP margin to spend any money now. Recall a loaneeBarcelona could recall one of their loanees if they're truly desperate about beefing up their midfield options. The only midfielder that comes to mind in that regard is Pablo Torre.

The legend was well-known for his ability to read the game and contribute both defensively and offensively. Der Kaiser's influence extended beyond the field, making him one of the most respected figures in the history of football. He was one of few footballers to win the FIFA World Cup as a player in 1974 when he led West Germany to the cup, and then as a manager in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Accumulating a total of 103 international appearances for West Germany, he secured victory in the 1972 European Championship and later triumphed in the World Cup hosted in his home country, a significant achievement following the disappointment of losing in the final to England in 1966. Club career with Franz BeckenbauerFranz Beckenbauer spent the majority of his club career with Bayern Munich and won numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple Bundesliga championships and European Cup/Champions League titles.    Bayern Munich squad led by him stood out as the premier club team globally in the mid-1970s, clinching three consecutive European Cups and Bundesliga titles. Additionally, Beckenbauer, in recognition of his outstanding contributions, earned the prestigious title of European Footballer of the Year on two occasions.    Beyond achieving success in football, Franz Beckenbauer has actively participated in diverse administrative capacities within the sport, playing a key role in the planning and execution of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that my information is only current up to January 2022, and there might have been further developments in Franz Beckenbauer's life or career since that time.    \\xa0    \\xa0 \\nMilestone Alert!\\nLivemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world 🌏 Click here  to know more.\\n\\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

Additionally, another resident, a barber, experienced a positive turn of fortune after encountering Messi. Meanwhile, a muralist who travels the world found inspiration in Messi\\'s World Cup triumph, leading to the creation of a widely acclaimed piece of art, the report added. Messi\\'s July visit to Prima Pasta captured global attention with patrons making an effort to maintain a sense of normalcy as Messi and his family dined nearby.“Messi casually walked in through the front door,\" Angelo Acción, 30, a bartender who was working that night told The Athletic. “At first the customers who were here didn’t realize that he had walked in. Once they saw him, a lot of the customers waited out back for him.\" Also Read: Lionel Messi to play 2026 World Cup?

Additionally, Cea has a guitar signed by the late Gustavo Cerati, a revered rock star from Argentina who frequented Prima Pasta before his passing in 2014. Having developed a friendship with the Messi family, Cea also owns a Gibson guitar signed by Inter Miami\\'s No. 10, the report noted. “Leo is always super cool,\" Cea told The Athletic, adding, “This was his third visit but his family has been coming for the last 12 years. He’s always so relaxed, always smiling. Never a problem. Just a very cool person.\" Cea noted that the agnolotti Rosso is Messi’s favourite dish, a stuffed pasta with ricotta cheese and spinach in pink sauce. The self-made barberLuis Andrés Rivera, also known as El Bori Barber on social media, is a Puerto Rican entrepreneur residing in Miami. His life took a turn last summer when he became Messi\\'s personal barber.    Rivera\\'s Destiny Barber Studio, situated in Wynwood, boasts a sleek and contemporary design, featuring three black leather barber chairs and a meticulously selected playlist of salsa music to enhance the ambiance.

On both occasions, Martin Odegaard was spotted doing something with his socks. That\\'s according to BBC Match of the Day pundit, former Wales and Swansea defender Ashley Williams. Williams noted Odegaard tampering with his socks before both corners as a possible signal to the taker on where to hit the corner. Quoted by Give Me Sport, Williams said: \"There’s always a trigger for what the [corner\\'s] movement’s going to be, and we can see they have worked on whether it’s a front-post corner or a back-post corner.\"If you keep an eye on Odegaard, we feel - maybe we’ve had too much time on our hands - but we feel that maybe he’s signalling something to the corner taker.\"He’s in the same place for every corner and he’s playing with his socks.

That's what brought Graham Potter down less than a year ago.One of the coaches Chelsea reportedly interviewed to succeed Potter was Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim. He did not get the job, but his body of work since then suggests that he should be back in the frame should Pochettino get the sack.Since taking over at Sporting four years ago, Amorim led the club to their first league trophy in 19 years, while also grabbing a couple of Portuguese League Cups. This season, his side is toe-to-toe with Benfica for another Liga Portugal title.Tactical style and strengthsThink of Amorim as a modern version of Antonio Conte, albeit not as combustible on the touchline.The constant feature of his team is a back three. However, the central defender is not used as a last man but as someone who can move forward and join the double pivot in the buildup. That would not be good news for Thiago Silva even if he stayed beyond this season.The wing-backs are attack-minded, holding the width in possession, while the front three are narrow and fluid, with players constantly rotating and overloading inside channels.Out of possession, Amorim's team can be flexible. They prefer to press high, with all three forwards and at least one wing-back involved. They can also drop low in a 5-2-3 shape. In both cases, the aim is to close the central lines, force the attacking team to the flank and narrow the space and passing lanes for the player on the ball.Potential weaknessRuben Amorim is a coach who rightly excites top European clubs. The question mark about him is whether he can make his system work as efficiently outside of the Portuguese league.As a head coach, Amorim has not worked outside Portugal. Even as a player, he did not play in another European country, with his only stint abroad being a season at Al-Wakrah in Qatar.In recent history, Chelsea hired two coaches who had never managed outside Portugal. One, Jose Mourinho, worked out fine; the other, Andre Villas-Boas, not so much. But they had experiences abroad, even if not as head coaches. So, hiring Amorim would represent a risk, regardless of his qualities.Lineup 1Let's imagine how the current Chelsea squad would fit in under Amorim if he took over now.We're also bearing in mind the current injury problems, which is why Reece James is not in our XI. Malo Gusto seems to be fitting in just as well, though.The biggest question seems to be up front. Nicolas Jackson has yet to convince he deserves to start regularly for Chelsea with all players fit. Perhaps, the solution would be to move Conor Gallagher forward, since there would be one midfield slot less under Amorim.Lineup 2Now, imagine if Amorim arrives at Stamford Bridge in the summer. He would not be given endless transfer funds, but some areas would need to be strengthened, particularly at centre-back and centre-forward.It is possible that James could move to a familiar and less physically demanding role in the back three which would also help keep Gusto in.Up front, though, a transfer is all but inevitable, and Chelsea have been linked with a centre-forward who just happens to thrive under Amorim at Sporting (16 goals and eight assists in 19 league games at the time of writing). His name is Viktor Gyokeres, he's familiar with English football, having spent three years in the Championship, and this season, he compares favourably even with Victor Osimhen.Hansi Flick at Chelsea: Tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIsRoberto de Zerbi at Chelsea: Tactical profile, biggest strengths and possible XIs, 2024-02-14T17:58:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-16-touching-story-of-how-jose-mourinho-supported-football-referee-in-his-fight-against-cance/, nan, Touching story of how Jose Mourinho supported football referee in his fight against cancer, Many people, even former Real Madrid players, remember Jose Mourinho as a fearless guy who was always ready for a heated altercation or a bust-up but in fact, Jose is a man with a big heart.Here is a story from his Real Madrid days told by former Premier League referee Mark Halsey.

Jose made sure we got looked after while we were over there.\"When I was battling cancer, the whole footballing world was good to me, but Jose in particular was incredible. I put on a charity dinner at Old Trafford, the cricket ground, and Jose sent a video over for us to play on the night.\"He took time out of his plans to put together a video, where he spoke about how he liked the way I refereed, he said I was like the 23rd player on the pitch because he could tell I loved the game and showed empathy for players and that I was very, very fair.\"Mourinho\\'s support helped Halsey win the fight: today, at 62 years old, the former referee is going strong and is a sometimes comes to Santiago Bernabeu.

His mobility is truly impressive. Like marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet, Kounde has mostly succeeded on Spanish battlefields. Moreover, Suchet’s most notable campaign occurred in Catalonia where he displayed exceptional defensive and organisational skills.William Saliba. The centre-back is a real fighter who knows how to clean up his teammates’ mistakes in the rear. As the standout defender, he could be compared to general Auguste de Marmont who demonstrated outstanding defensive skills during the Peninsular War and in various battles against the British.Dayot Upamecano. The Bayern centre-back is one of the most powerful and hardworking players in the roster. His aggressiveness reminds us of another of Napoleon’s marshals, Pierre Augereau, who led the French forces in a fierce way against the Austrian army at the Battle of Castiglione.Theo Hernandez. The left-back would have a special role on Napoleon’s team as the most damaging attacks would be launched exactly from his wing. His fearlessness and audacity would make him as important as marshal Jean Lannes was for Bonaparte –\\xa0his bold and effective attacks helped turn things around in the Battle of Marengo against the Austrians.Eduardo Camavinga. The midfielder has made his fans create songs about him –\\xa0almost as if he were some legendary soldier of the past. Cama is a versatile warrior who can occupy almost every position in midfield in defence. Eduardo’s historical ‘twin’ is Nicolas Soult who rapidly rose through the ranks at a young age and demonstrated top ability in both defence and offence.Aurelien Tchouameni. The defensive midfielder will make sure Bonaparte’s winning record is perfect –\\xa0Real Madrid are yet to lose a single game with him on the pitch this season. We would compare him to Andre Massena, one of Napoleon’s most successful comrades, also called the ‘Dear Child of Victory’.Kingsley Coman. It’s not just the pace that makes Coman special –\\xa0he is also clutch in big games, including Champions League finals. Besides, few players can boast about having won 29 trophies at just 27 years old. His historical prototype can be Louis-Alexandre Berthier who broke into the French army as a youngster and played a big role in campaigns all over the world.Antoine Griezmann. One of the most loyal players in the history of the national team. A symbol of Les Bleus who has hit his prime again. Griezmann is the analogue of Napoleon’s ‘Iron Marshal’ Louis-Nicolas Davout, mostly known for his tactical brilliance and exceptional intelligence that was at its best at the Battle of Austerlitz.Kylian Mbappe. Although the French superstar is not an easy player to deal with, he remains the team’s most powerful force for years to come. His effectiveness and courage make us feel he is Michel Ney – Napoleon’s legendary comrade who led his army from the front lines, particularly in the Peninsular War against the Spanish and Portuguese where he earned the ‘Bravest of the Brave’ nickname.Olivier Giroud. The 36-year-old is definitely not among the fastest France players, but his work rate and physical ability make him a standout performer too. As a recent Serie A winner who keeps playing a key role at 37, he could be compared to Eugene de Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy who was quite effective in some of the biggest engagements of the Napoleonic Wars including the Battle of Wagram.What formation would he choose?To identify Napoleon’s game plan, let’s use the famous Battle of Austerlitz as an example – the engagement that took place between the French army and the Russian and Austrian forces in 1805, ending in the latter’s decisive defeat and the collapse of the Third Coalition which was chiefly made up of Britain, Austria and Russia.It’s arguably as iconic as the 1998 World Cup final between France and Brazil. Just like in that game, where France played with 10 men for half an hour, Bonaparte’s troops were outnumbered –\\xa0some 72,000 men against 85,000 opposition soldiers.Here is a brief description of what was happening on the battlefield back then:Based on Napoleon’s deployment of troops during the Austerlitz, we believe he would pick the 4-2-1-3 formation for his team. It would be quite asymmetric, though, as his greatest tactical trick would be deceiving the opposition by deliberately weakening the right side, just like in the famous battle:With the opposition mostly deploying their forces on France’s right flank, Napoleon would take advantage of the gap in the opponent’s middle area and attack the space:After the midfield battle is won and the opposition are spread to the left and the right, Napoleon would proceed by attacking the opponent’s vulnerable wings – mostly through his left which is still fresh as it wasn’t quite involved yet.Although Kylian Mbappe is usually used as a striker in the national team, here he would be deployed on the left wing to use his pace to the fullest. Call it one more major tactical tweak of Bonaparte to make his left wing absolutely destructive:After the opposition is exhausted, Napoleon would make sure the battle is won by using his reserves. Explosive forwards like Randal Kolo Muani, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku could add some freshness to the attack in the second half:Napoleon Bonaparte would’ve really taken the world of football by storm – and his non-stop tactical creativity would also make him fun to watch.We can only wonder what bets people would have made on that battle back in the day if they had had such an opportunity.

Back then they had Lionel Messi helping them achieve it. The Blaugrana earned around €3m for lifting the trophy that year, including TV revenue. Fast forward to 2024, Messi is long gone and Barca can't get past the quarter-final stage of the Copa Del Rey. This season, the winners of the Copa del Rey will smile to the bank with a fixed prize money of €1.2m. When TV revenue is factored in, the champions could go home with around €5 million in winnings. Usually, the Copa del Rey prize money depends on the competition's TV revenue for the year. Although it's nowhere near La Liga, winning the competition comes with a handsome financial reward exceeding €5 million for top clubs like Barca who attract larger TV audiences. The Blaugrana could do with every penny. Barca earned around €400,000 for reaching the quarter-final of the Copa Del Rey this year, but that's barely enough to cover Frenkie De Jong's two weeks salary. Besides the prize money from the Copa Del Rey, Barca are also at risk of missing out of the Spanish Super Cup next January. Appearing in the competition this year fetched Barca €6 million in revenue. Barca's route to the Super Cup now lies in winning La Liga or at least finishing second like they did two seasons ago. Xavi: 'We have competed very well.

The 27-year-old Brazilian, who has found success as a midfielder under Eddie Howe, suffered a thigh injury in the Magpies' recent FA Cup victory over Sunderland. With surgery scheduled for next week, it's unlikely Joelinton will feature again this season.Reports suggest that Joelinton's current wage demands exceed what Newcastle are willing to pay, leading to speculation that he might be sold before making another appearance. The Mail outlines that, with only 18 months left on his current deal, a compromise needs to be reached for Joelinton's long-term future at the club.It would be tough for Howe to lose the midfielder, as he really wants to keep Joelinton.

If Mbappe leaves PSG in June he will do so as a free agent with Real Madrid not obligated to pay any transfer fee. Still, the sign-on bonus will be the biggest ever paid for a player arriving on a free transfer in football history if Florentino Perez agrees to it. Mbappe's salary demands are also acrimonious when compared to what other Real Madrid players currently earn. Madrid's top earner Toni Kroos bags less than €15m net per season. Mbappe is demanding nearly three times that, which isn't up to his current salary at PSG. Real Madrid probably understands that the 25-year-old will cost them an arm and a leg even if they're getting him as a free agent. Thus, the economic conditions of the deal will be studied carefully before the green button is pressed.

With his set-piece quality, ball retention ability and passing traits, he can definitely help the Red Devils control games better. With that being said, here are two ways Man United can line up with him next season.Option 1: In midfield with MainooKimmich can slot into Man United’s midfield shape nicely and also be the ideal partner for the blossoming Kobbie Mainoo. As he likes to play a more deeper role, the German midfielder can allow Mainoo to wander forward in attempts to create moves and score goals. Joshua and Mainoo’s energy and defensive qualities mean that Bruno Fernandes can also probably play a more attacking role going forward.Option 2: Emergancy right-back optionEven though he’s now a full-fledged midfielder, Kimmich is a really versatile player who has played as a right-back in the past for Bayern Munich. That means he can be a cover option in that area too for Man United, potentially allowing the club to play the Casemiro-Mainoo connection.

He currently plays defensive midfielder for Burnley, where he has been since 2023.

Deco is personally interested in inviting the Portuguese to the club: the 49-year-old is set to leave Porto at the end of the season and Blaugrana’s sporting director knows him well.The former Portugal international has done a decent job at the helm of Porto. Let’s see what he can offer us.***Conceicao is renowned for his teams’ intense, high-tempo, aggressive style of play. His players aim to regain possession quickly and go forward using all their width in a 4-4-2 formation that turns into 4-2-4 in the offensive phase. In defence, he mostly relies on players in the middle of the park, using two energetic midfielders (one of those is ex-La Masia prospect Nico) and two rock-solid centre-backs.Porto’s biggest strength under Conceicao is exactly the way they attack down the wings: full-backs actively support wingers who cut inside while one of the two strikers drops back. You may spot multiple wingers and full-backs among Porto’s players with the most goal contributions this season.In recent head-to-head clashes, Barca players struggled to properly mark Porto’s opposition attackers, allowing multiple big chances despite dominating the game in possession.Expectedly, Porto’s biggest weakness is defending the wings: Conceicao’s first-choice wing-backs, Wendell and Joao Mario, are usually pretty much involved in the attack and it’s difficult to cover for them all the time. The Portuguese specialist probably dreams of working with Joao Cancelo who is arguably the most complete wing-back one may find.Let’s think about two line-ups Conceicao might use at Barcelona:Lineup 1Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Yamal, De Jong, Gavi, Raphinha; Lewandowski, Felix.Looks like a great option if Barca make no big summer signings. Two attack-minded wing-backs, the centre-back partnership that looked fantastic against Porto in the Champions League, dynamic and energetic midfield and the four-man attack full of players Conceicao would love to work with (he actually coached Raphinha for some time back in the day).Lineup 2Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Raphinha, Gavi, Pedri, Pepê; Lewandowski, Felix.If there’s one player Conceicao would probably want to take to Barca, it’s Pepê (not the Real Madrid bully), especially given Blaugrana’s plan to sign a left winger. The 26-year-old leads the way with the most assists for Porto this season –\\xa0just like last term when he finished the campaign with 10.Is Sergio Conceicao your preferred candidate to take over at Barca?

Answered, A question that's been on the minds of Manchester United fans lately is whether Pep Guardiola would follow Jurgen Klopp's footsteps and leave Manchester City anytime soon. Well, according to The Athletic, it's not too soon to presume Guardiola's heading in that direction. Klopp has announced he will leave Liverpool at the end of this season. Considering his influence for the Merseysiders, who are on course to win another Premier League title, fans won't be too sad to see him go. Another nemesis for Man United is, of course, Guardiola, who has single-handedly set exceptionally high standards for the Premier League. Fortunately, The Athletic understands Pep is unlikely to stick around and may look to return to Barcelona once his contract expires at the end of next season. Guardiola was being linked with a departure even in 2022/23, which ended with Man City winning the treble. With INEOS in charge and the Glazers' power diminishing, it's the perfect time for Man United to capitalise on this shift in the Premier League.

Scored a beautiful goal to give Chelsea the lead and then saw them squander it.

He made a few brilliant saves to deny Wolves and was REALLY not helped by how sloppy his defenders were.Enzo Fernandez – 6.5The Argentine midfielder did lose the ball leading to the third, but did his job decently apart from that. He moved the ball around well and completed over 70 passes with 91% accuracy, and created two chances too – which were wasted.Moises Caicedo – 4Caicedo had a strange game, which were mostly involved in lows. He did get his first assist of the season, setting up Palmer’s goal with a beautiful pass. But then things started going wrong, as Caicedo gave the ball away for the equalizer and kept constantly losing the ball and made zero tackles.Raheem Sterling – 4Sterling had an extremely inefficient game and never looked to be a major threat in terms of creativity, failing to create anything. He had a huge scoring chance early in the second half, but blasted the shot over the bar – summing up his poor outing.Malo Gusto – 3Gusto had a nightmare against Wolves’ counter-attacks and could not do much to neutralize their threat on the left at all. Won just 2/13 duels, couldn’t make any tackles and then gave away the penalty with a silly foul in the box.

They dispatched off Tottenham Hotspur to move into the fifth round of the FA Cup (where they’ll face Luton Town) and are set to face FC Copenhagen in the Champions League Round of 16.Pep Guardiola’s side is stacked with a high-quality squad and with a plethora of options in nearly every single position on the pitch. Off the pitch, they are a well-run organization that works swiftly and efficiently in tying down players to long-term contracts.With that being said, there are some interesting Man City players whose contracts are currently scheduled to expire in less than 18 months (after the end of the 2024/25 season). Here they are.Kevin de BruyneThe Belgian star has been a pivotal part of Man City’s success in the Guardiola era. He made an amazing return from injury recently, having contributed a goal and two assists in his last three appearances since coming back. De Bruyne’s contract, however, is currently set to expire on June 30, 2025. That means that if unable to agree a new deal before the end of the season, the summer window could be especially interesting for the 32-year-old. De Bruyne isn’t getting younger and Man City are a team that always builds for future success, so it’ll be interesting to see how they handle his contract situation.Stefan OrtegaThe Man City no.2 goalkeeper has actually produced some solid performances as a back-up for Ederson, having kept two clean sheets in the FA Cup this season. He’s a solid shot-stopper and especially impressive in moving the ball around. Ortega’s current contract is set to expire at the end of the 2024/25 season. Man City haven’t shown any interest in extending it yet, as they might want to see a few more performances before deciding whether or not to keep him for the long term.Zack SteffanSteffan was recently loaned out to MLS side Colorado Rapids for the remainder of the season and has spent the majority of the last few seasons out on loan. His contract expires at the end of June next year and at this point, it doesn’t seem like Man City has long-term plans for the USMNT star., 2024-01-30T08:35:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-15-man-united-working-to-appoint-another-exman-city-chief-in-key-role/, Meghna @ 1819, Man United working to appoint another ex-Man City chief in key role, According to The Athletic, Manchester United have reached out to Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox to join as a key member of the new-look sporting hierarchy under Sir Jim Ratcliffe.

While it would take a while to bring the Spaniard back to match fitness, the news begs the question of how the 32-year-old would fit into Liverpool's midfield setup.The arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wataru Endo, as well as the insane progress of Curtis Jones, mean that Thiago is no longer an automatic starter when he's fit.So assuming he'd be fit in a few weeks' time, here are three ways the Reds could line up with the Spaniard.1. In his natural positionThiago's natural position is that of a left-sided central midfielder. This is where Curtis Jones currently plays and the Spaniard will replace the Scouser in the starting XI.2. As a no. 6CuJo is arguably the most in-form player at Liverpool right now: dropping him, as suggested above, just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, Thiago is quite versatile: he can play as a no. 6. Apart from being excellent in passing, the 32-year-old stats last season showed that he was consistently the best tackler in the squad. He also makes a crazy number of interceptions per game — so his qualities suit the position of a holding midfielder.Mac Allister has learnt the holding role really, really well while Wataru Endo was dropping 10/10 performances as a no. 6 before he left for the Asian Cup. But we can still see Thiago here. 3. New formationLiverpool now have an insane amount of talent in the midfield. Why not get the most of them and play an extra midfielder at the expense of a forward? Klopp has shown that he can change the system mid-season: last term, he began playing Trent in a hybrid role which changed how the whole team operates. Of course, the Reds were in crisis when he made that change so the circumstances forced the manager to get creative.There is much less need for Klopp to reinvent the team but why not experiment in the FA Cup or the Europa League and see if it works?, 2024-01-31T14:29:06.000Z, tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-26-kalvin-phillips-is-given-unusual-west-ham-shirt-number/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, Kalvin Phillips is given unusual West Ham shirt number, Kalvin Phillips is embarking on a new chapter, joining West Ham on loan from Manchester City until the season's end.

Ocampos was shocked when a fan poked him in the anus as he went to take a throw-in. The stunned player turned around to scold the fan before calling the attention of the Rayo players and referee. Here\\'s a video of the incident. Ocampos would later call for a stiff penalty for the offending fan while drawing a comparison to what usually happens when women are involved. A good example is the case involving former Spain FA boss Luis Rubiales and Barcelona Femeni icon Jenni Hermoso. \"If it happens in women\\'s football we already know what can happen,\" Ocampos said. \"I held back because I have two daughters and I hope that tomorrow it doesn\\'t happen to them,\" said the winger. \"I didn\\'t know who it was, I wanted to hit them. I have two daughters, and I didn\\'t want my daughters to go to school and have people tell them that their father hit someone,\" the player added. Ocampos is probably spot on. Rubiales was stripped of his role as a FIFA executive and forced to resign his position as Spain RFEF president for kissing Hermoso on the lips during the women\\'s World Cup final celebrations last year.

The Manchester United goalkeeper has now been involved in a furious bust-up with Cameroon Football Association president Samuel Eto'o. The duo reportedly had a row during the 2022 World Cup as well, arguing over Cameroon playing out from the back. This time, he was particularly miffed at manager Rigobert Song decision to bench him and confronted Eto'o about it. However, Onana was unable to justify being selected which ultimately led to this situation. He missed Cameroon's opening 1-1 draw with Guinea to play for Man United in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. The Red Devils reportedly flew him to the AFCON in a private jet, which cost a cool £79,000. He then started in the crushing 3-1 defeat to Senegal and was benched against Gambia subsequently. Cameroon won that game 3-2 and managed to qualify for the Round of 16. As per the report, they may choose to rely on Fabrice Ondoa, Onana's cousin, to play between the sticks beyond this.

It took Real Madrid three controversial refereeing episodes and time until minute 67’ to equalise, and one more cheesy call to enable the winning goal. But let’s go episode by episode.The controversies1. Controversial penalty call. Real Madrid\\'s \\'comeback\\' began with a divisive penalty before the hour-mark. The VAR officials noticed an apparent handball by an Almeria player while contesting for a corner, giving them a free-kick.However, before the ball even hit the player\\'s arm, Antonio Rudiger was clearly seen lunging on the back of an opposition player and clearly fouling him. The officials opted to see past that and stick with the penalty, which was converted by Jude Bellingham.2. Almeria denied a third goal. As Almeria were still leading 2-1, they had a golden chance to score a third — which they did. However, the goal was disallowed for an alleged foul in the build-up. As an Almeria player was shielding the ball, his hands touched Jude Bellingham’s face. The referee Hernandez Maesco was right in front and saw nothing wrong with it until the VAR Hernandez Hernandez intervened.3. Madrid equalise seemingly through handball. Just six minutes after Almeria were denied a third goal, Real Madrid found their equalizer through what came off as a blatant handball from Vinicius Jr. The winger guided the ball into the goal with what looked like a part of his arm. Even after a VAR check, the goal was given as officials felt it hit his shoulder - with football rules accepting goals from a player\\'s shoulder. 4. Vinicius spared for elbowing his opponent. The final episode in the chain of controversies happened in minute 87’ with the scoreline 2-2. Vinicius elbowed his opponent in the face as the ball wasn’t even moving in his direction. The VAR room spoke to the on-field referee and both concluded it was fair play.\\xa0Almeria\\'s protestAlmeria manager Gaizka Garitano was infuriated to see his side robbed in the second half. He got sent off towards the end for protesting the referee\\'s decision and fumed after the game, saying: \"I don’t usually talk about referees but everyone has seen this game and it’s not the first time this has happened to me here. Then we get penalised for talking, my opinion is worthless. What can I say. I have no words to describe what happened today.\"Gonzalo Melero, their midfielder, called out the robbery and said: \"We are leaving with the feeling that we were robbed. I don’t think we could have done more from the off to put them in the game. There’s no way to accept it. What happened today was beyond all limits.\"Almeria are still up in arms about the result and continued their protest after the win on social media. They posted a cheeky picture hinting that goals scored by Real Madrid with the use of hands are as legal as headed goals. Gerard Romero leaks audioMeanwhile, pro-Barcelona journalist Gerard Romero fueled the fire even further by posting a leaked audio clip that indicated that Vini Jr should\\'ve been sent off for an elbow on an opponent. Romero posted an audio clip where the VAR referee, Hernandez Hernandez, seemed to indicate that he saw a foul from Vini towards an Almeria player. Here\\'s how the conversation went.Hernández Hernández (VAR): Possible foul in attack. I want to see. A little further back, a little further back (...) Ugh, I want to see it in short.Hernández Maeso (Referee): For me it is a struggle between both of us. He complains about his face but I don\\'t see anything.Hernández Hernández: When he\\'s going to take it off, when he\\'s going to take it off with his arm... when he strokes it, it hits him in the face .Hernández Hernández: Let\\'s go live.The journalist obviously did not take permission from the Spanish referee committee, who as per Cadena SER, have opened an investigation on how this audio from the VAR room was accessed by Romero.There are also investigations being made on why the incident was not reviewed on the VAR monitor by the match official Francisco Hernandez Maeso if a possible foul by Vini was spotted.Barca\\'s reactionBarcelona fans were understandably infuriated with the manner in which Real Madrid basically stole three points.

However, the Eagle ended up being a sparrow: he finished the game with no goals or even shots, made just eight passes and lost half of duels. Oh, and the 2-1 defeat flattered Nigeria.How did it happen? Let’s take a look at the Elephants’ lucky formula and how Xavi can implement it against Napoli in the Champions League.What was Nigeria’s own plan for Osimhen?Osimhen was doing way more than just waiting for the ball to come to his feet: early in the first half already, the striker dropped deeper to look for link-ups and make Nigeria’s attacks more structured. This had to do with a big gap between the midfield and the attack as the former were located too deep.While Osimhen is far from being the best link-up striker in the world (he’s surely better than Lewandowski in this regard, though!), Ivory Coast still paid a lot of attention to his involvement in attacks and tried to close him down collectively.Here, for example, Osimhen tries to escape from his marker and provide Samuel Chukwueze with a quick lightweight pass. The ball doesn’t reach its destination as Chukwueze is being followed by the right winger (!) Max Gradel. The attack is stopped. At Barca, we may imagine Raphinha emulating what Gradel does here.In another episode, Osimhen wins the ball after a throw-in before trying to link up with his teammates up front. The immediate reaction of Ivory Coast players is brilliant as they close him down in numbers and manage to steal the ball without a foul.Expectedly, Nigeria also tried to send floated crosses into the box to find Osimhen (Napoli often look for him with crosses) –\\xa0that’s when powerful left-footed centre-back Evan Ndicka, a former Barca target, came into action. We think it’s crucial for Barca to start Inigo Martinez who is great at minimising the aerial threat.Who was man-marking Osimhen?This job was mostly done by Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Odilon Kossounou who did very well and had Osimhen in his pocket starting from minute one.Nigeria often tried to find Osimhen with a long ball coming from one of the defenders or the goalkeeper. Kossounou had to make sure the striker didn't break away from him. Here he did a great job by pulling out and intercepting the ball.Even late in the game, when Nigeria were pushing for an equaliser, Kossounou remained rock-solid in his head-to-head clashes against Osimhen.Look how confident he was while trying to avoid pressure from Victor. Wow.The Barca player who can do the same stuff against Osimhen is surely Ronald Araujo, also a right centre-back who’s even taller than Kossounou. We need him in his absolute top form against Napoli.One thing Araujo shouldn’t risk doing is going with the ball forward. Firstly, he is not great at it; secondly, Osimhen may punish him for that. Shortly after Kossounou did it and Ivory Coast lost possession, they got exposed defensively as Nigeria almost launched a dangerous counterattack.Osimhen once again dropped deeper, collected the ball from Zaidu and beat Kossounou with a backheel pass Nigeria failed to capitalise on.How did Osimhen try to get out of Kossounou’s pocket?By moving to the wings – that’s how he started the second half, often switching to the right and sometimes to the left as Nigeria were trying to attack in different ways after a poor first half in which they somehow found the net.At some point, Osimhen’s marker was experienced left-back Ghislain Konan who also did well in head-to-head battles. It’s quite concerning that Barca’s left-back is going to be Joao Cancelo (who is really weak defensively), but at least he’s got pace, like Konan.Collective effort was still key for Ivory Coast in the second half: when Osimhen was trying to connect with his teammates, they kept surrounding him and cutting his oxygen off.While the Elephants were superb at containing Victor Osimhen, it’s worth mentioning that they managed to stop the vast majority of Nigeria’s attacks long before the ball could’ve got to the striker –\\xa0even despite the latter’s contribution in the build-up.Osimhen heat map v Ivory CoastWhat should Barca XI v Napoli be?Defence-minded (at least for the first leg), filled with powerful centre-backs who are pacy enough to contain Osimhen’s rapid runs and full-backs who can track the striker’s movement on the wings.Here is our preferred option.Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Inigo, Cancelo; Pedri, De Jong, Gundogan; Yamal, Lewandowski, Raphinha.- Only the best-available centre-backs in: no error-prone Andreas Christensen and Pau Cubarsi;- Ronald Araujo and Inigo Martinez should definitely start for their superb ability to win aerial duels;- Joao Cancelo is the weakest link at the back but he can be supported by Raphinha who is solid defensively –\\xa0he could help contain Osimhen when the Nigerian moves to his right., 2024-02-14T11:23:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-03-xavi-threatened-barca-exit-over-star-players-potential-sale/, nan, Xavi threatened Barca exit over star player's potential sale, There's been a lot of talk linking Ronald Araujo with a move to Bayern Munich this winter.

In 2021, the former midfielder took over Girona in the second tier. Two and a half years later, they sit comfortably second in La Liga, well ahead of Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. How did that happen?Tactical styleAs a smaller club from Catalonia, Girona have looked up to Barcelona for a long time. This season, however, a serious argument can be made that they play better Barcelona-style than the traditional giants.Under Michel, Girona builds up from the back, with three field players and occasionally the goalkeeper participating. In the final third, it's fluid, depending on the players at Michel's disposal. The attacking group is joined by at least one wing-back, depending on whether Girona plays with three of four at the back out of possession. They can overload the flanks and create space for central players to make third-player runs, with Aleix Garcia as the main ball distributor in the middle of the pitch.Up front, Artem Dovbyk is a physical presence but can also make runs in behind. In his absence, Girona can even play with a false nine. Whoever is on the pitch, the end product is usually there: this season, they have scored more than two goals per game on average.WeaknessesThings are not so rosy at the other end of the pitch. In the top half of the La Liga table, only two teams have conceded more goals than Girona (29 goals conceded in 24 games at the time of writing).Four of those goals were scored in a top-of-the-table clash with Real Madrid. Girona effectively folded after letting in the first goal in the 6th minute. We're yet to see how Michel's team will respond to such a setback in the medium term.Lack of experience can also count against the 48-year-old. Pochettino is just three years older than him but has coached in more than twice the number of games that Michel has — and for the latter, a lot of those matches were in the second tier.The Spaniard's rise with Girona has been spectacular, but this is the first time when his side is fighting for any major trophy. A jump to the Premier League, especially to such a demanding club like Chelsea, could be too soon for him.Probable lineupsGirona have played with both a back three and a back four under Michel, so we'll consider both of these possibilities.If Chelsea are affected by the Financial Fair Play and can make no signings, Michel may play with a false nine. Christopher Nkunku seems to be the best option, although Cole Palmer also has the experience now.Chelsea are still likely to sign a No.9, and Michel wants a player who can be both a physical presence and a runner in behind the defence. You're not likely to find anyone better than Victor Osimhen.❓ Would you like to see Michel coaching Chelsea next season?

It means Madrid applies extra caution and proactiveness in such situations with players like Antonio Rudiger being a key protagonist. Real Madrid also acknowledges the intense work of their set-piece coach Mauri and the other analysts. Mauri works with the players to anticipate the physical attributes of their rivals and anticipate their movement in the box and how they attack set-piece.

We’ve come up with our own compilation using attributes from multiple famous managers.Tactical wizard: Pep GuardiolaFrom re-inventing tiki-taka (although he doesn’t like it to be called that way!) at Barcelona to constantly dominating the Premier League with Manchester City, Pep Guardiola is easily the best tactician one may hire.The Catalan wouldn’t have been this successful if he had continued asking his teams to play the Barcelona way. While his main emphasis is still put on dominating possession and defending by keeping the ball, Pep has become more flexible, especially in big games: perhaps the biggest highlight of the treble-winning 2022/23 season was beating Arsenal with just 36 per cent possession but clinical finishing.Guardiola’s players evolve as much as his teams do: it was him to create a legendary false-nine role for Leo Messi; him to transform Phillip Lahm into a fantastic holding midfielder; him to turn John Stones into a high-quality defensive midfielder; him to make Nathan Ake a superb inverted full-back – the move that made the long-awaited treble possible. Sometimes he overthinks too much, but 11 league titles in 15 years as a coach prove his ideas are always relevant.Man-management: Carlo AncelottiOne of the most player-centric coaches of our time, Ancelotti knows perfectly what it means to be on the same page with his squad. At Chelsea, he used to discuss his training methods with the team and allow them to make game-plan suggestions, gradually adjusting his tactical style to their preferences. This didn’t mean he would just bend to them, though: he had no problem benching Didier Drogba when the latter was late to training. It’s all about balance and finding the best solution for everyone.In his second stint with Real Madrid, the Italian built a team jokingly called ‘Friendship FC’ for their outstanding cohesion. Vids of him dancing with his players after the Champions League glory of 2022 still go viral from time to time.‘He’s like a big teddy bear. He’s really sensitive and is a great guy. He would speak to us every day. Not just to me but to all the players,’ Cristiano Ronaldo once said, adding that every player should get the chance to work with Don Carlo.Conditioning: Antonio ConteIf your club are targeting Antonio Conte as their next head coach, you know the players won’t be hanging around on a training ground while all layabouts will be kicked away – but this will possibly result in a league title (or even three in a row depending on the league).Right upon taking over at Chelsea, the Italian surprised his players with exhausting running sessions already during the preseason, even John Terry admitting he had never experienced anything like that in his 18 years at the club. The word ‘exhausting’ perfectly describes everything else that happens during Conte’s training sessions: Eden Hazard once revealed the Italian would often ask the players to repeat one simple passing drill to complete automatism.Conte also had strict rules regarding the players’ diet and… sex, revealing that they should make as little effort as possible and refrain from long-lasting sexual relationships.Attacking: Marcelo BielsaBielsa’s recognisable tactical approach involves relentless pressing and incredibly fast ball circulation. He managed to display his attacking outlook in England when his Leeds United ended a Premier League season with 62 goals scored right after promotion\\xa0– only five teams found the net more often in that 20/21 campaign.El Colo puts some immense emphasis on physical preparation. No surprise one of the Argentine’s training approaches is called ‘Murderball’: this is like the No Rules mode on FIFA when players divide into two teams and play offensive football without any free kicks, throw-ins, fouls or other stoppages. One day Bielsa even stunned Leeds’ youth side, asking them to play this way.Despite all that, Bielsa is first and foremost a brilliant tactician. After getting sacked by Leeds, he revealed he had watched all the 380 matches of the preceding La Liga season as he was eyeing a comeback to Athletic Club.Defending: Jose MourinhoWhile the Portuguese is jokingly described as a park-the-bus coach nowadays, he actually revolutionised the Premier League with his defensive approach back in the day, making the general tactical trend less direct and straightforward.Prime Jose built a dream Chelsea team that only conceded 13 goals and kept 24 clean sheets in the 2004/05 season. This was also the campaign when almost half of the Blues’ wins were 1-0s.‘5-4 is a hockey score, not a football one,’ he said at the time. ‘In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4, I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly’.Mourinho once came up with a hilarious metaphor when asked about the importance of having a solid defence: ‘It's like having a blanket that is too small for the bed. You pull the blanket up to keep your chest warm and your feet stick out. I cannot buy a bigger blanket because the supermarket is closed. But I am content because the blanket is cashmere. It is no ordinary blanket.’The way Jose invested in cashmere proved he really adored his defensive style.Set-piece specialist: Sam AllardyceBig Sam was a truly progressive and innovative coach for the Premier League, drawing inspiration from physically-oriented American soccer that developed in the same way that their football worked.Conditioning and ‘moneyball’ methods aside, Allardyce noticed the importance of set pieces and their effectiveness. His Bolton side would later score more than a third of all their goals through dead-ball situations while part of the transfer strategy would be dedicated to finding players who were great in this aspect.The trend of Big Sam’s teams remained intact over time: when he secured Sunderland’s Premier League survival in 2015/16, his side bagged more set-piece goals than any other team while also conceding the fewest.Comeback king: Jurgen Klopp‘WE decide when it’s over. Between 82 and 94 minutes, you can make eight goals if you want! But you have to work for it,’ Klopp said after Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in November 2015, aiming a dig at the Reds’ fans who left the stadium long before the final whistle.Back then, nobody could imagine Jurgen Klopp’s team would later be called the ‘comeback kings’ and the ‘mentality monsters’ for their ability to turn things around at any point. The 4-0 against Barcelona and the 4-3 against Borussia Dortmund are just the most standout turnarounds among multiple comebacks in the Premier League.There was a feeling Liverpool somewhat lost their comeback ability in Klopp’s worst season at the helm, the 2022/23, but by February 2024 already, his side won as many Premier League points from losing positions as in their title-winning 2019/20 season.What does the future hold for Jurgen Klopp after his Liverpool exit? You may check the latest odds hereFather figure: Sir Alex FergusonOne of the biggest things Sir Alex was renowned for was his ability to develop youngsters, nurturing many into world-class players. Multiple Man United legends have opened up about his role as a mentor and a father figure in their careers as he guided them on and off the pitch.‘For me, Sir Alex Ferguson is like a father in football. He helped me a lot, he taught me many things, and in my opinion, of course he had a big role because of the relationship that we had,’ were the words of Cristiano Ronaldo.David Beckham even called Fergie ‘one of the most important people’ in his life from the age of 12-13: ‘He came to us as a small, skinny little boy you know? But when you see potential it sticks out at you. It's your job then to bring that to fruition, to make them a man.’Ferguson nurtured the entire club, not just those talented teenagers: he oversaw several generations in his 27 years at United and continues to do it now, albeit in a less impactful role.Bargain deals: Arsene WengerThe Frenchman was a master of discovering under-the-radar talents and luring them to Arsenal for bargain fees.Some of the most notable examples of Arsene’s low-cost policy include Robin van Persie (€4.5m), Patrick Vieira (€5.35m), Cesc Fabregas (€3.2m), Kolo Toure (€185k) and Nicolas Anelka (€760k), two of them being crucial parts of the Gunners’ famous Invincible squad. Even Thierry Henry’s €16m signing in 1999 can be considered a low-cost one considering his total impact on the Premier League’s and Arsenal's history.Wenger’s shrewd approach was relevant until his final days at the Emirates as he was never eager to overpay for any player.In-game mimics: Miguel HerreraThe Mexican first made the headlines with his emotional outburst as the manager of Club America, becoming the protagonist of some hilarious memes.Herrera later became the head coach of Mexico’s national team and even led them at the 2014 World Cup. His side scored five goals in four games of the tournament, so he had many reasons to celebrate the way he loves doing it the most., 2024-02-06T21:48:33.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-could-girona-be-denied-a-champions-league-spot-because-of-man-city-link/, nan, Could Girona be denied a Champions League spot because of Man City link?, Many people wonder if Girona would be allowed to participate in the Champions League amid their strong connection with Manchester City.Everything indicates there will be a way for the La Liga revelation to do it.The City Football Group only own 47 per cent of the shares at Girona. The Catalans' owners also include US-Bolivian businessman Marcelo Claure who owns 35 per cent and the Girona Football Group (Pep Guardiola's brother Pere) who owns another 16 per cent. Pere Guardiola is also chairman of the club's board of directors. Nominally, he is a completely independent person there.On the one hand, Man City own absolutely nothing at Girona –\\xa0they just have a common owner, the City Football Group, in whose structure they are nominally equivalent. On the other hand, the fact that Red Bull is the owner of both Salzburg and Leipzig forced the company to transfer the rights to the club itself in order to remain its main sponsor.However, Girona have nominally independent managers, and several cases this season (Milan and Toulouse, Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise, Aston Villa and Vitoria) prove that this is enough.All Girona need is to agree to a series of conditions:1. not to transfer any players to Manchester City, neither on permanent deals nor on loan basis, neither directly nor indirectly, until September 2024;2. not to enter into any collaborations, joint technical or commercial agreements;3. not to use a joint scouting or player database.Of course, this does not completely rule out the risk that UEFA will suddenly see Pere Guardiola's connection to Man City or, more generally, the management relationship between the two clubs – but the cases mentioned above confirm that nominal independence is sufficient here., 2024-01-26T21:45:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-03-one-underrated-thing-leo-messi-did-in-super-bowl-ad-with-ted-lasso-spotted/, Nаdine, One underrated thing Leo Messi did in Super Bowl ad with Ted Lasso – spotted, Lionel Messi just made a surprise appearance in a Super Bowl ad.

While berating the referee\\'s performance on the night, the analysts on TV went to critically analyze the three penalties Real Madrid were denied in the game. They insisted that two were as clear as day. \"On the possible penalties, two remain for Bellingham. The first was due to a knockdown by Savic when the Englishman was running towards a ball that left him alone in front of Oblak. “There is no need to talk, it is shameful that it is not pointed out. He puts his elbow in his back so that he cannot advance, ignoring the ball. It\\'s like a cathedral, clamorous!

When I realised pretty early that happened, it’s a really good team with massive potential and a super age group, super characters and all that, then I could start thinking about myself again and that was the outcome. It is not what I want to [do], it is just what I think is 100 per cent right.”“We will have a moment, maybe the last matchday here or somewhere else – I mean in other countries or other competitions. There’s enough time to do these kinds of things. Let’s now really go for it.

The young coach has almost done the impossible - he has a really good chance of breaking FC Bayern Munich's dominance in the Bundesliga and doing so with Bayer Leverkusen.Although he says he is living a happy life at Leverkusen, Bayern are said to have him firmly on the list of possible successors to Thomas Tuchel.Xabi Alonso is a very flexible coach who has tried out many different formations since taking office. One of his most popular variations is the 3-4-2-1, but he has also played with a 4-3-3 or a classic 4-4-2 several times.Alonso has gotten the best out of his two full-backs and Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong are now dream targets for several top clubs. There's also a lot of quality in the midfield. The move for Granit Xhaka was initially met with scepticism, but now he stands as one of the best in his position. Victor Boniface in attack is also noteworthy, although unfortunately, he is currently injured.Alonso places great emphasis on the midfielders as the main creative force, which is why his team tends to have a lot of possession (57% on average this season). Alongside Xhaka, players like Florian Wirtz, Jonas Hofmann, Exequiel Palacios, and Robert Andrich contribute to the team's midfield strength. Upfront, Alonso prefers a lone striker, a style that's quite characteristic for FC Bayern as well.Let's take a look at the possible lineups.Option 1Neuer - Upamecano, De Ligt, Kim - Mazraoui, Kimmich, Goretzka, Davies - Musiala, Sane - KaneThis is probably the best Bayern team if all players are available now (in a three-man chain).Option 2Neuer - Upamecano, De Ligt, Kim - Mazraoui, Kimmich, Goretzka, Grimaldo - Musiala, Wirtz - KaneWith Xabi Alonso, two FC Bayern targets could move to Munich. Florian Wirtz has long been a target for Munich and it would be interesting to see his duo with Jamal Musiala at Bayern.As for Alex Grimaldo, he is seen as a possible replacement for Alphonso Davies, which wouldn't be a bad option for Beyern either.Potential Bayern XI with Jose Mourinho, 2024-02-16T07:18:56.000Z, Tribuna\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-28-my-family-has-suffered-a-lot-xavi-reveals-next-plan-after-barca-job/, Toby Prince, \\'My family has suffered a lot\\': Xavi reveals next plan after Barca job, Xavi announced his decision to quit his role as Barcelona coach at the end of the season after Saturday\\'s 5-3 defeat to Villarreal at the Olympic Stadium.The club legend said he would take some time off from the game to rest with his family who have suffered a lot with him.

The football world was rocked recently by the news of Xavi Hernandez's departure from Barcelona, leaving fans wondering who will step up to fill his shoes.\\xa0\\xa0With speculation swirling, one name that has emerged as a potential replacement is none other than Mikel Arteta. But is the former Arsenal midfielder the best option to lead Barcelona into a new era? Let's dive in and explore.\\xa0The Xavi Legacy: A Tough Act to Follow\\xa0First things first, let's talk about Xavi. As one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Xavi's influence on Barcelona and the game of football as a whole cannot be overstated. With his vision, passing ability, and tactical intelligence, he was the heartbeat of the Barcelona midfield during their golden era, playing a pivotal role in their numerous successes.\\xa0But with Xavi now departing for new challenges, Barcelona find themselves in need of a manager to lead the team forward. The question is: who can possibly fill the void left by such a legendary figure?\\xa0Arteta: The Apprentice Becomes the Master?\\xa0Enter Mikel Arteta. The former Barcelona youth product may not have enjoyed the same level of success as Xavi during his playing career, but he has certainly made a name for himself as a manager. After hanging up his boots, Arteta transitioned into coaching and quickly caught the eye of Arsenal, where he served as Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City.\\xa0In 2019, Arteta returned to Arsenal as the club's head coach, tasked with reviving a struggling team. While his tenure at Arsenal has had its ups and downs, there's no denying the impact he has had on the team, leading them to FA Cup glory and instilling a more cohesive playing style.\\xa0The Barcelona Connection: A Return to Roots\\xa0What makes Arteta such an intriguing candidate for the La Liga Barcelona job is his connection to the club. As a product of La Masia, Barcelona's famed youth academy, Arteta understands the club's ethos and style of play better than most. His time spent under the tutelage of Guardiola at Barcelona and later at Manchester City has also given him invaluable experience and insights into the tactical nuances of the game.\\xa0\\xa0With Barcelona in need of a fresh start and a return to their identity as a possession-based, attacking team, Arteta's footballing philosophy aligns closely with the club's values. His emphasis on tactical discipline, fluid passing, and pressing fits seamlessly with the Barcelona way of playing, making him a natural fit for the job.\\xa0The Challenges Ahead: A Steep Learning Curve\\xa0Of course, taking charge of a club of Barcelona's stature comes with its own set of challenges. The expectations are sky-high, and the pressure to deliver immediate results can be overwhelming. Arteta will need to prove himself capable of handling the demands of a top-tier club and navigating the complexities of managing a star-studded squad.\\xa0Additionally, Arteta's lack of experience as a top-level manager could be cause for concern. While he has shown promise during his time at Arsenal, he is still relatively inexperienced compared to other candidates who may have more extensive managerial resumes.\\xa0Conclusion\\xa0In conclusion, while Mikel Arteta may not be the most obvious choice to replace Xavi at Barcelona, he certainly brings a unique set of qualities to the table. His deep understanding of the club's culture, coupled with his tactical acumen and coaching pedigree, make him a compelling option to lead Barcelona into a new era.\\xa0However, only time will tell whether Arteta is up to the task of filling the shoes of a legend like Xavi and guiding Barcelona back to the summit of football. For now, the footballing world waits with bated breath to see what the future holds for both Xavi and Barcelona, and whether Arteta will indeed be the man to usher in a new era of success at Camp Nou., 2024-02-08T10:30:05.000Z, nan\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-28-erik-ten-hag-im-not-thinking-about-winning-fa-cup-at-this-moment/, Meghna @ 1819, Erik ten Hag: \\'I\\'m not thinking about winning FA Cup at this moment\\', Erik ten Hag has cautioned Manchester United fans about harbouring unrealistic expectations ahead of the FA Cup fourth-round clash with Newport County.

Hojlund was seen as a €60million or €70million player, but the final fee was much closer to €90million.”For the time being, Chelsea have not received a transfer offer for Broja, who is still likely to start up front in the upcoming game against Middlesbrough.Armando Broja position on Chelsea exit revealed (reliability: 3 stars)Chelsea want to sell Broja (reliability: 5 stars), 2024-01-19T11:34:00.000Z, GiveMeSport\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-26-jurgen-klopp-is-leaving-liverpool-everything-you-have-to-know-in-13-key-points/, nan, Jurgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool: everything you have to know in 13 key points, 1. Jurgen Klopp has announced his summer exit from Liverpool. The news came as a shock as the German has a contract until 2026.2. The 56-year-old says he's not the one for the future. Among other reasons, he cites fatigue as the key factor.3. Klopp is not sure he'll ever coach another club again. One thing he is sure of is that if he does, it won't be an English club.4. Pep Ljinders leaves, too. In fact, the entire backroom staff go with Klopp.5. Xabi Alonso has spoken out on potentially succeeding Klopp. As an ex-player and already a successful coach, the Bayer Leverkusen boss is hugely popular among Liverpool fans.6. Liverpool could line up in two formations under Alonso. While it's all hypothetical, we've provided insight into Alonso's coaching.7. Bayer's stance on letting Alonso go is known. He doesn't have a release clause, but it seems like he won't be held hostage at his current club.8. Roberto de Zerbi has been asked about the Liverpool job. The Brighton head coach prefers to focus on his team at the moment.9. Bookies have already slashed odds on Klopp's successor. Xabi Alonso, Roberto de Zerbi and even Steven Gerrard are among the favourites.10. Klopp won't advise FSG about his successor. The gaffer says the club don't need advice from 'an old man walking out'.11. FSG aren't the reason Klopp leaves. The German made sure to respond to this suggestion in his press conference.12. Bookies have named seven potential destinations for Klopp. After Jurgen is done with sipping cocktails, he won't have a lack of suitors but some jobs stand out the most.13. Oh, and Klopp's final game as Liverpool's head coach isn't far away.

Cristiano Ronaldo, the league\\'s standout figure, had high hopes for more big names joining. Speaking to Saudi broadcaster SSC Sport, Ronaldo said: \"I\\'m happy because when I made the decision to come here nobody believed what I said.\"\"But that is the past. It doesn\\'t matter anymore, the most important is that the league has grown and that players want to come because they know the league is competitive and the whole world is watching now.\"But things are taking a different turn. Just this month, there are talks about Karim Benzema considering going back to Europe. Surprisingly, Jordan Henderson has left Al Ettifaq, even though he had previously pledged to support the growing league.Aymeric Laporte has also spoken about many players feeling unhappy. You can clearly see some things falling apart in the Saudi Pro League. Here are five reasons why this can be happening. Poor crowdsAlthough it has some superstar players, the Saudi Pro League faces a problem with low attendance when compared to Europe\\'s \\'big five leagues.\\'This season, an average of 8,345 fans attended a Saudi Pro League match, and some games had fewer than 1,000 supporters. For instance, on October 22, Henderson\\'s Al-Ettifaq lost 1-0 to Al-Riyadh in front of only 696 supporters. Many other games during the same weekend also didn\\'t reach the 1,000 attendance mark.Lack of competitivenessIn the summer, Saudi Arabia\\'s public investment fund acquired the nation\\'s top four clubs: Al Nassr, Al Hilal, Al Ittihad, and Al Ahli. Currently, three of these teams hold the top four positions in the season\\'s standings.This takeover has created a noticeable gap between the league\\'s best and worst clubs, and it is expected to widen further. While this lack of competitiveness is a critique faced by many major leagues globally, it poses a particular challenge for a growing division without an established global audience. This aspect might not be an attractive selling point for the leaguePlayers failing to acclimatise properlyJordan Henderson has already left the Saudi Pro League, clearly not finding a comfortable fit in the Gulf state.Aymeric Laporte, in an interview with Spanish newspaper AS, openly acknowledged the challenges of adapting to his new surroundings: \"They have not made it easy for us. In fact, there are many players that are discontented. \"We are working on it every day, negotiating so to speak, and to see if it improves a little because this is something new for them too, having European players who already have a long career. Maybe they are not used to this and have to adapt to a little more seriousness.”Star players failing to make an impactOne striking case is Neymar Jr, who joined Al Hilal in the summer but suffered an ACL and meniscus tear while on international duty with Brazil in October. Unfortunately, this setback is expected to keep the Brazilian star out until the start of the next season.While Ronaldo and Aleksandar Mitrovic have lived up to expectations by scoring a total of 37 goals this season, some of the league\\'s other prominent stars, like Sadio Mane, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino, haven\\'t been as dynamic as they were in the past.Inability to attract players at their peakThe Saudi Pro League has faced challenges in drawing players at their prime. During the summer, most arrivals were renowned players looking to wrap up their careers and earn Gulf state wages in the process.Aymeric Laporte: \\'Many footballers are unhappy in Saudi Arabia\\', 2024-01-23T09:20:14.000Z, SSC Sport\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-27-4-things-sir-jim-ratcliffe-already-doing-differently-than-glazers-at-man-united/, Meghna @ 1819, 4 crucial things Sir Jim Ratcliffe already doing differently than Glazers at Man United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's decision to purchase a 25% stake in Manchester United was met with negativity at first. As INEOS near Premier League ratification of the minority takeover, there is a sense of optimism at Old Trafford again. Even when not fully in control, Ratcliffe and his team have already set moves in place that show their desire to do things differently than the Glazers. Tribuna.com takes a look at four such vital moves so far. Establishing proper structureFor the first time since the days of David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson, Man United are attempting to establish a proper structure at the very top. INEOS is intent on bringing in experienced and skilled people to make the tough decisions. They have already finalised former Man City executive Omar Berrada to join as the new Chief Executive Officer at the end of this season. Ratcliffe is not hesitant to take inspiration from Man City's structural hierarchy to adopt a similar approach at Man United. Over the years, the Red Devils have not had the right people to make big decisions. However, with the appointment of a sporting director next on Ratcliffe's agenda, that could change soon. Commercial ops & football go hand in handInitially, the Glazers were supposed to oversee commercial operations while Ratcliffe focused only on football matters. That will also change as Ratcliffe and his INEOS team will also have their say in commercial ventures. Commercial success cannot be achieved without football; Man United became an indomitable global brand only after Sir Alex's impeccable work on the field. One cannot exist without the other - and that's why Ratcliffe intends to bring more cohesion into two aspects that are essentially two sides of the same coin. Cultivate football-first attitudeBelieve it or not, Man United are finally moving towards building an environment that puts 'football first'. You'd think that part would be obvious at a football club but, nope. We only have the Glazers to thank for turning Man United into an 'adult version of Disneyland' as Jurgen Klopp put it not-so-kindly. Streamline transfers And finally, all important decisions on transfers will be taken by the new incoming sporting director. Previously, Ed Woodward made most of the decisions - some of which Man United are still paying the price for. The club desperately needs a reliable head to make the hard calls; getting rid of players and, of course, scouting new talents and negotiating good deals. As far as good deals are concerned, incoming CEO Berrada was responsible for Man City's incredible coup for Erling Haaland. They signed him for just £51.2  million and that's nothing short of a steal. These changes are most welcome and they need a proper shake-up from the top. Although they won't guarantee titles or success on the field, it's certainly a step in the right direction., 2024-01-27T11:06:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-29-no-klopp-and-arteta-anymore-6man-list-of-potential-xavi-successors/, Kosta König, No Klopp and Arteta anymore: 6-man list of potential Xavi successors, Several candidates to take over at Barcelona after Xavi's departure have dropped out in recent hours.Here is what the list looks like now.- Hans-Dieter Flick (without a club, ex-Bayern and Germany);- Imanol Alguacil (Real Sociedad);- Thiago Motta (Bologna);- Roberto De Zerbi (Brighton);- Michel (Girona);- Thomas Tuchel (Bayern).There is no standout candidate at the moment, but these are the most mentioned names within credible sources.❓ Who would you like Xavi's successor to be and why?, 2024-01-29T21:57:14.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-01-mohammed-kudus-chooses-three-legends-as-his-favourite-players-but-names-a-surprising-pick/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, Mohammed Kudus chooses three legends as his favourite players but names a surprising pick for his GOAT, West Ham's Mohammed Kudus revealed his favourite football legends and dropped a surprising choice for the greatest player of all time.

Carlo Ancelotti was forced to make an early change to his starting XI with Vinicius suffering an injury in the warmup. Carletto smartly chose Brahim Diaz who could offer more defensively than Joselu. The younger Spaniard repaid the faith by bagging a first-half goal. Unfortunately, Real Madrid failed to extend their lead, no thanks to some horrendous refereeing. But Los Blancos shot themselves in the foot late into the game through Ancelotti\\'s substitutions and their erratic defending. The boss subbed off Brahim for Joselu after 71 minutes and that decision allowed Atleti to get out more frequently and attack Real Madrid with Brahim no longer there to terrorize their defence. \"Atleti will be more than happy to see the back of Diaz,\" La Liga TV said upon Brahim\\'s substitution.

Harry Kane is probably already waiting for his former boss Jose Mourinho, who wants to take charge of Bayern and even started to learn German for this occasion. Bayern are unlikely to be short on elite coaches if Tuchel is dismissed, so it could be any boss. However, let\\'s have a look at the potential Bayern XI with Jose Mourinho. It deserves your attention because it is an interesting one.Jose Mourinho used a 3-5-2 formation at Roma and he will probably use it in Bayern if he actually joins. In defence, the formation easily transforms to 5-3-2 due to the hard-working Mazraoui and lightning-fast Davies. As for the CM positions, Goretzka and Kimmich pair makes sense with the latter being one of Mourinho\\'s most favourite players. \"I see him as a top right-back, left-back, centre-back, No.6, No.8, No.10... he has qualities to be anything,\" Mourinho told DAZN about Kimmich. \"He\\'s intelligent and understands what he has to do here and what he has to do there. I think he\\'s phenomenal - absolutely phenomenal player.\"The player for the AM role will be chosen between Musiala and Muller. Starboy Jamal is clearly ahead of Muller in skills like dribbling and passing. However, Mourinho likes senior players, so Muller\\'s experience could be crucial for the AM position.There is no need to explain why Kane would be the striker in Mourinho\\'s XI. As for the second attacker, it has to be Sane due to him playing one of the best seasons in his career. He has to be in starting XI being a key player for Bayern right now. As for the central defenders\\' role, Dier\\'s name can stand out to someone. However, him being in the starting lineup completely makes sense. Dier speaks fluent Portuguese, and Mourinho tends to switch to Portuguese when vocabulary fails him in a foreign tongue, so Dier could conduct Jose\\'s ideas.The second reason is a serious one: Dier would play on the right side, closest to the toilets in Allianz Arena.

Under Wenger, Arsenal transformed, embracing innovative tactics and achieving remarkable success. Notably, his tenure shifted the club's perception and expectations significantly. Football enthusiasts, especially followers of live odds, saw a dramatic alteration in Arsenal's prospects, both domestically and internationally.\\xa0\\xa0Revolutionary Tactics and Training\\xa0Wenger was a pioneer in football tactics and training. He introduced dietary changes and advanced training methods, profoundly influencing players' performances. Wenger's tactics were evident in matches and seasons, where Arsenal's gameplay stood out. Key players, like Thierry Henry and Robert Pires, developed under his guidance, going on to become legends of the game. Wenger’s strategic formations and player signings redefined Arsenal's approach to the game.\\xa0\\xa0He emphasized fluid passing and maintaining possession, a stark contrast to the then-prevalent direct style of English football. His focus on developing young talents, like Cesc Fàbregas, and connecting them with experienced players, created a dynamic and strong team.

Arsenal's campaign ended with 26 wins, 12 draws, and zero defeats, standing as a proof of Wenger's tactical expertise. Their dominance in these key fixtures was crucial in crafting an unbeaten league season, a rare feat in football history. Arsenal were unbeaten for 49 games in a row.\\xa0The Emirates Stadium - Vision and Legacy\\xa0Wenger's vision extended beyond the pitch. His ideas and plans led to the construction of the Emirates Stadium. This strategic move was aimed at ensuring the club's future growth and financial stability.

This period was challenging, yet Wenger's leadership and foresight ensured that Arsenal remained competitive while laying a foundation for the future.\\xa0Wenger's role in the Emirates had many ups and downs, and it involved balancing budget constraints while maintaining team performance.

Thiago MottaThe former Barca man is said to be Deco's favourite who is also liked by Joan Laporta. He is currently doing a great job with Serie A side Bologna who are just 3 points behind the Champions League spot at the moment.2. Rafa MarquezThe Barca Atletic boss was initially targeted as an interim coach in case Xavi left the club during the season. However, he might also take up the permanent head coach role as he's admired by Laporta.3. Roberto De ZerbiThe Brighton boss was tipped to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City one day, but the Barca situation opens up a new opportunity for him. His possession-based style of play would be a big bonus.4. Julian NagelsmannThe German is also said to be among Laporta's favourite options. If things go wrong for Germany's national team at the Euros or the 36-year-old simply decides to leave, he would be a tidbit for the board.5.

The Frenchman has reportedly taken the biggest step towards Madrid by telling PSG he wants to leave. One big question that would be on everyone's mind is, how best Mbappe would fit in at the current Real Madrid squad. The answer is simple — 4-3-3. Real Madrid were lining up in the 4-3-3 formation when they won the Champions League and La Liga in 2022. They were doing it under the same manager — Carlo Ancelotti. To accommodate Mbappe, Ancelotti simply needs to revert to his 4-3-3 system that had Karim Benzema spearheading the attack and winning the Ballon d'Or at the end of that season. Mbappe is not a typical number 9 who stays up front waiting for opportunities. Like Benzema, Mbappe likes to drift deep and into the wide areas to receive the ball and affect the game. Vinicius formed a deadly partnership with Benzema playing that way and will likely do so again with Mbappe.On the right-wing, Rodrygo will hold his own, forming a devastating front-three of Vini-Mbappe-Rodrygo. Jude Bellingham will likely drop deeper with Mbappe arriving. The midfielder has been Real's top scorer this season but that's the job of a striker. Finally, with Mbappe's arrival bringing an end to a four-man midfield, Camavinga might have a reduced role.Here's the best lineup that accommodates Mbappe at Real Madrid: Real Madrid reach agreeement to sign Mbappe (reliability: 5 stars), 2024-02-15T20:44:02.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-30-luka-modric-worried-about-real-madrid-future-as-ceballos-overtakes-him-in-pecking-order/, Kingsley_, Luka Modric 'worried' about Real Madrid future as Ceballos overtakes him in pecking order, Luka Modric has grown ever so worried about his Real Madrid future in the aftermath of Carlo Ancelotti promoting Dani Ceballos ahead of him in the midfield pecking order, per Sergio Lopez of Diario AS.It happened in Real Madrid's last game against Las Palmas where Ancelotti decided to deploy Ceballos ahead of Modric in his heavily-rotated starting XI. Modric didn't come off the bench for the entire game and it was the fifth time that has happened this season. Modric has played just 42% of the available minutes at Real Madrid this season, putting him 15th on the list of players with the most minutes at the club this term. He's played just 50 minutes more than Andriy Lunin. However, the Croatian legend has performed well when given the chance. Of the 24 games he's played this term he's contributed six assists and scored once. Still, Ancelotti doesn't see him as part of his best XI.  Modric is out of contract in June and his limited playing minutes will certainly impact the club's decision to extend his deal or let him go. In September Modric will turn 39. The veteran midfielder has spent 12 years at Real Madrid winning every possible trophy with the club. Perhaps this is his final rodeo in White.

Interestingly, there are similarities between football tactics and the strategic gameplay of live casino games, particularly poker. In this guide, we will explore the latest trends in football tactics and how they share common ground with the strategic manoeuvres used in the high-stakes poker world.\\xa0Evolution of Football Tactics\\xa0Modern football has shifted from traditional formations and playing styles to a more dynamic and flexible approach. Coaches now focus on exploiting the opponent's weaknesses, with tactics evolving throughout a match. High-pressing, possession-based football and fluid formations are among the latest trends. These strategies aim to control the game's tempo and exploit spaces in the opponent's defence.\\xa0Similarly, in poker, players constantly adapt their strategies based on the game's dynamics. Much like football teams adjusting their tactics during a match, poker players must be observant and responsive to the changing landscape of the table. The ability to read opponents, analyse betting patterns, and adjust one's play accordingly is crucial in both poker and football.\\xa0High Pressing in Football and Aggressive Play in Poker\\xa0High pressing has become a hallmark of many successful football teams. It involves putting intense pressure on the opponent in their defensive third, aiming to win back possession quickly. This strategy disrupts the opponent's build-up play and creates scoring opportunities.\\xa0In poker, an analogous approach is observed through aggressive play. Aggressive poker players frequently raise and re-raise to apply pressure to their opponents. This strategy aims to force opponents to make mistakes, just as high pressure in football pushes the opposing team into errors. Both high pressing in football and aggressive play in poker require a fine balance between calculated risk-taking and strategic execution.\\xa0Possession-Based Football and Patient Poker Play\\xa0Possession-based football focuses on maintaining control of the ball and patiently waiting for opportunities to present themselves. Teams employing this strategy are often adept at keeping possession, waiting for the right moment to launch an attack.\\xa0In poker, a patient and selective playing style mirrors possession-based football. Skilled poker players exercise discipline, folding marginal hands and biding their time for premium opportunities. Possession-based football and patient poker play require a keen understanding of when to be assertive and exercise caution.\\xa0Fluid Formations and Adaptable Poker Strategies\\xa0Modern football teams often employ fluid formations that can seamlessly transition from defence to attack. This adaptability keeps opponents guessing and allows for quick transitions between different phases of play.\\xa0In poker, adaptability is also key. Successful players adjust their strategies based on their opponents' playing styles, stack sizes, and table dynamics. Just as a football team might shift from a defensive formation to an attacking one, poker players must be capable of changing their approach to stay ahead in the game.\\xa0Conclusion\\xa0Football tactics and poker strategies may seem worlds apart, but a closer look reveals intriguing parallels. Both realms require a blend of skill, strategy, and adaptability. As football tactics continue to evolve, drawing inspiration from the dynamic world of poker can provide coaches and players with fresh perspectives on approaching the beautiful game. Whether it's high-pressing and aggressive play or possession-based football and patient poker strategies, the common thread lies in the need for astute decision-making and the ability to read and respond to the ever-changing landscape. The synergy between these seemingly disparate worlds highlights the depth and complexity inherent in both football and poker., 2024-01-22T18:15:45.000Z, nan\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-16-the-patellar-tendon-mourinho-on-ronaldos-injuries-and-how-good-he-could-be-without-them/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, \\'The patellar tendon\\': Mourinho on Ronaldo\\'s injuries and how good he could be without them, The year 2000 marked a heartbreaking moment in football history when Ronaldo Nazario, fondly known as \\'El Fenomeno,\\' suffered a devastating knee injury that altered the course of his career.In a Coppa Italia match between Inter Milan and Lazio, Ronaldo, making a comeback after a five-month lay-off due to a previous knee injury, attempted one of his trademark runs. A stepover during the dribble led to a collapse on the turf in excruciating pain. This injury turned out to be severe, completely tearing his kneecap tendon.The sight of Inter and Lazio players rushing to Ronaldo\\'s aid and the entire Stadio Olimpico rising in applause as he was stretchered off, head in hands, remains etched in football memory. The Ballon d\\'Or winner\\'s career took an unfortunate turn that day, underscoring the fragility of even the most exceptional talents in the beautiful game.On the question \\'Whether Ronaldo could have been better without injuries\\', Mourinho answered \\'Yes\\', however he also added that the Brazilian didn\\'t like to train.

The Brighton boss impresses decision-makers at Barca with his style of play and football IQ as shown in the Premier League for one-and-a-half seasons now. Brighton and Barcelona already established a relationship when Ansu Fati was sent there on loan for the season during the summer. Barca allowed the talented youngster to join De Zerbi's team after studying the coach's style of play and ability to bring the best out of young players. De Zerbi guided Brighton to a sixth-place finish in the Premier League last season. A historic achievement for the club. This term, De Zerbi's Brighton are still performing well by their standards as they sit seventh in the Premier League. But their biggest achievement this term is reaching the round of 16 of the Europa League. Brighton have never achieved that feat in their history.

The attack wasn\\'t fluid and clinical enough, the midfield lacked creativity while the defensive structure was simply terrible once again.One of the things that hurt Blaugrana the most in the Copa del Rey quarterfinal was Jules Kounde\\'s poor communication with Lamine Yamal on the right side.Even though the two eventually linked up for a goal, they poorly understood each other throughout the game. The best example is Lamine\\'s misplaced pass in the first minute that led to Nico Williams\\' interception and Gorka Guruzeta\\'s shocking opener.Things slightly improved afterwards, but there was still a lack of proper connection on that right wing – partly because the two were covering almost the same areas.Some fans were losing patience with Kounde who kept on making forward runs despite Yamal\\'s presence.💭 EiF: \"Jules Kounde needs to realise what he is. You\\'re a centre-back playing at right-back. Lamine Yamal is wide open. Pass him the ball. Stop getting cute. Let him do the work, you provide support.\"How can the problem be fixed? There are at least three options.1. Ask Kounde to play a less attacking role in possession and make Yamal a wide midfielder who would receive the ball in deeper positions. This way, the gap between the two players would be bigger and the teenager would have more freedom of action. Lamine is great at beating opponents 1-v-1 and passing the ball in central areas, so he could do the job well.2. Use a natural right-back instead of Kounde. Joao Cancelo or Hector Fort would probably have better connection with Yamal as the ones who play on the wing for many years already.3. Improve the understanding by playing them together more often. Yamal has been a starter alongside Kounde on just 9 occasions so far, and most of the time, it was when Jules played at centre-back, so it\\'s obvious their connection isn\\'t perfect., 2024-01-25T17:32:53.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n', 's://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-04-david-moyes-30-scoreline-not-correct-west-ham-performed-better-than-man-utd/, Meghna @ 1819, David Moyes: \\'3-0 scoreline not correct, West Ham performed better than Man Utd\\', David Moyes is not pleased with West Ham United\\'s 3-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford this Sunday.

If Arteta ends up at Barcelona in June as Xavi's replacement, Barca fans can expect a manager who plays attacking football and knows how to bring the best out of his players. We've seen that with the likes of Martinelli, Saka, Odegaard and Saliba. Indeed, Arteta hasn't done badly in his first job at the highest level, winning three trophies in four years. Now let's look at two ways the 41-year-old is likely to set up his Barca team.Option 1. 4-3-3The 4-3-3 is Arteta's preferred formation. He used it for every Premier League match Arsenal has played this season. Arteta's idea is to use a left-footed winger on the right and a right-footed winger on the left. That allows them to cut in and shoot with their stronger foot or invert into the central areas to create an overload. Hence, players like Raphinha and Ansu Fati (when he returns from loan) will get a lot of game time. Arteta is expected to give more minutes to Vitor Roque than Xavi has. That's because Mikel prefers a workaholic number 9 to a static one, an example being Gabriel Jesus - who's also Brazilian like Roque. In midfield, Arteta will appreciate players like Gavi and De Jong who work extremely hard for the team. A creator like Pedri will serve as Arteta's Martin Odegaard. If Barca doesn't sign a new defender, Arteta's defence will be no different from the one Xavi used to win the league last season. Take a look:Option 2. 4-2-3-1Arteta doesn't shy away from tweaking his formation depending on the opposition. We've seen him use the 4-2-3-1 formation in the Champions League this season and in some games last term. This system will allow the new Barca boss to feature some special players like Ilkay Gundogan pairing with De Jong to form a solid midfield base. Lamine Yamal will also get a chance to figure on the right wing with Ferran Torres operating from the opposite flank. Here's option 2:, 2024-01-29T11:10:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-one-worldclass-2-yet-to-prove-themselves-barca-la-masia-products-ranked/, Kingsley_, One world-class, 2 yet to prove themselves: Barca La Masia products ranked, Barcelona say their La Masia Academy is the best in the world and it's hard to debate against that. How else would you describe a football Academy that produced Leo Messi, Xavi, Iniesta Busquets and other legendary footballers? But all that is in the past. The question is, has La Masia produced players who are helping Barca achieve their sporting objectives? Your answer is as good as mine. Now let's rank Barca's La Masia products currently doing it at the highest level for the first team. World class. The only La Masia product in this category is Gavi. He's a starter not just for Barca but for the national team too. It's hard to think of any club in the world where Gavi wouldn't start and play regularly. Starting XI: Besides Gavi, who's a world-class player, the one La Masia graduate who regularly starts for Barca is Alejandro Balde. Too bad he's injured now. But many top teams will take Balde without blinking. Next big thing: We've all been treated to the magic that's Lamine Yamal but we can agree he's not the finished article yet. His misses against Bilbao tell the tale, and we've seen this before with Ansu Fati. Meanwhile, Pau Cubarsi is reportedly tipped to become the future of Spain's defence. We can only wait to find out but these players look like gems. Decent back-up: Marc Guiu has come off the bench to score a couple of goals for Barca this season, it's why Xavi sometimes prefers him to Vitor Roque. Fermin Lopez is Xavi's best bet to cover for the Pedri-Frenkie-Gundo midfield trio. In defence, Hector Fort's performance during Barca's Copa Del Rey elimination would give Xavi some relief following Balde's injury. Not bad players to have on your bench. Yet to prove himself: We're yet to see more of Marc Casado and Pau Victor. The midfielder and striker are yet to establish themselves in the dynamics of the first team.

United are yet to make an official offer for the Dutch striker but fans are already curious about another business proposition with Ajax and what this 21-year-old player could bring.Say no more!1. Finishing\\xa0Brobbey is ice-cold in front of goal - a trait that is much-needed at Man United. In an underwhelming Ajax side this season, he has still managed to score 15 goals in 26 appearances across all competitions. He also hit double figures last season.\\xa0Beyond goals, two stats stand out when it comes to Brobbey:8.84 progressive passes received per game on average;9.14 touches in the opponent's penalty area on average.It means that Brobbey practically lives in the opposition’s penalty area, he’s a fox in the box. In comparison, Rasmus Hojlund averages 4.93 touches in the opponent's penalty area while Marcus Rashford does 6.07.2. Pace & strength\\xa0Standing at 5”9”, Brobbey doesn't rely on his height to hurt defences. Instead, he uses his pace and raw power along with clever movement and clinical finishing to be so deadly in attack.A good example is his recent goal against RKC Waalwijk. Brobbey received the ball on the edge of the box, then used his pace and strength to beat his marker before finishing superbly with his weaker left foot.  3. Link-up play\\xa0Brobbey is also effective in linking up play in midfield areas to help progress possession. He occasionally drops into deeper regions to offer assistance to his teammates and then accelerates the play with his pace.\\xa0His preferred method, however, is to do it all by himself. A decent dribbler, Brobbey attempts one dribble per game on average (h/t Fbref) and mostly uses it to penetrate the opponent’s penalty area. The image below (h/t Wyscout) shows his all-time carries and dribbles. You can see that he usually takes the ball near the penalty area to carry it inside and, ideally, round it off with a strike.4. Chance creationBrobbey is not selfish, he works hard for his team. He also possesses good vision in the final third to create chances for his teammates. He has four assists thus far and created about 30 goalscoring chances in the league.\\xa0\\xa0But Brian Brobbey is no Hollywood playmaker like Bruno Fernandes — he won’t bother with risky passes to satisfy the crowd. Rather, he’ll do the elbow grease he does best: outmuscle his opponents and square the ball. If his recent assist against NEC looks familiar to his goal shown above, that tells you how strong the lad is with his body.Brian Brobbey refuses to rule out Man United transfer after almost joining in 2022, 2024-01-23T18:44:58.000Z, Tribuna\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-15-2-iconic-jersey-numbers-real-madrid-can-offer-mbappe-in-the-summer-shown/, Kingsley_, 2 iconic jersey numbers Real Madrid can offer Mbappe in the summer — shown, Kylian Mbappe has told PSG he wants to leave.

Scored a lovely goal to mark this perfect performance.Odegaard: 9. Was the Gunners' most creative player today, always coming up with ways to trouble the opposition defenders with his passing and movement. Two assists today.Saliba: 8. Rose highest in the box to break the deadlock for the Gunners shortly after the half-hour's mark. Rock-solid at the back.Gabriel: 8. Overtook Thomas Vermaelen to become Arsenal's second-highest-scoring defender in history with a nice header to score the Gunners' third goal. He now has 14 strikes for Arsenal.Saka: 8. Started rather poorly, losing the ball way too often in the first 30 minutes of the game but got on after scoring a penalty. Scored the Gunners' fifth after absolutely destroying Aguerd on a turn.White: 7.5. It might have gone unnoticed but Benny Blanco's performance was amazing today. Played in an inverted role, helping Arsenal deal with the absence of Zinchenko. White drifting inside helped the Gunners play through the Hammers press.Kiwior: 7. Forced to play at left-back due to injuries and did well considering he's a centre-back after all. Good in one-on-one situations, not particularly helpful going forward.Havertz: 6. Still looks a bit lost in the Arsenal midfield.

The major sides like Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United and Chelsea have not made a single signing and seem to be satisfied with the prospect of going past the window without any new acquisitions.A major reason behind the majority of Premier League clubs not signing players is because of their fear of breaching the strict Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules set by the league. Everton have already been docked 10 points earlier this season for doing the same for last season and Nottingham Forest are also under threat of facing punishment.After most clubs spent lavishly in the 2023 summer window, they don’t have the necessary means to spend big in the winter window without breaching the spending limits. As a result, there have only been a handful of permanent transfers involving Premier League clubs.The most expensive transfer for a Premier League club in the winter has seen Tottenham Hotspur sign defender Radu Dragusin from Genoa for £25m. Here are the seven most expensive January 2024 transfers in the Premier League.Radu Dragusin to Tottenham Hotspur - £25mClaudio Encheverri to Man City - £12.5mValentin Barco to Brighton & Hove Albion - £7.9mDaniel Munoz to Crystal Palace - £6.9mKosta Nedeljkovic to Aston Villa - £6.5mYunus Emre Konak to Brentofrd - £3.9mHakon Valdimarrson to Brentofrd - £2.6m, 2024-01-30T14:00:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-21-fabrizio-romano-reveals-who-will-decide-greenwood-sancho-futures-not-ten-hag-or-ratcliff/, Meghna @ 1819, Fabrizio Romano reveals who will decide Greenwood, Sancho futures — not Ten Hag or Ratcliffe, According to Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United intend to appoint a new sporting director to decide the futures of Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho once they return from loan in the summer.

Their club president said so himself, telling journalists how Barca could exploit a possible loan deal for a new midfielder. But that is highly unlikely to happen with Barca still fighting with one hand tied behind their backs by Financial Fair Play regulations. According to Fabrizio Romano, Barca have lost out on two midfield targets they carefully analyzed for January. One of those midfielders is the highly talented Belgian star Arthur Vermeeren. Romano has given his trademark 'Here We Go' claiming the 18-year-old has reached an agreement to sign for Atletico Madrid. Romano reveals how Atletico offered an initial €15m package to land the talented midfielder. The total package could reach €25m. Barca simply couldn't make such an offer to Royal Antwerp. Meanwhile, Barca have also missed out on Manchester City's combative midfielder Kalvin Phillips. Phillips will join West Ham on loan after an agreement was reached with Man City. Barca were probably beaten off because West Ham offered to sign the player permanently at the end of the season. Barca reportedly hoping to sign Phillips on a six-month loan with no buy option and no loan fee. The Blaugrana simply wanted to cover his salary like they're doing with Felix and Cancelo. 10 days left of January transfer window — here's what to expect from Barca in coming days, 2024-01-24T07:29:49.000Z, FabrizioRomano\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-26-trust-me-xavi-names-one-thing-that-should-get-every-barca-fan-excited/, Kingsley_, \\'Trust me\\': Xavi names one thing that should get every Barca fan excited, \"Trust me, Barcelona have very good future and I\\'m not talking about myself,\" Xavi said. \"I\\'m talking about the youngsters.

He had been part of the Samuel Eto\\'o Academy in Cameroon for four years before joining Barca in 2010 to spend five more formative years in La Masia. Barca let him go to Ajax for merely €150,000 — a sum that rose by 340 when he transferred from Inter Milan to Man United last summer.Although he was disappointed by a lack of faith from Barcelona, Onana still has warm feelings for his former club: \"Barcelona is my home and I grew up there. I have a very, very good relationship since I left\".Right-back: Samuel OkunowoBack in the day, top clubs didn\\'t have scouts in every corner of the planet, so stars had to align for youngsters like Samuel Okunowo to be noticed by big clubs.Barca scouts discovered the Nigerian at a U18 tournament in 1997; they were sent there to watch Xavi, then a budding midfielder from La Masia, but Okunowo was so good the Catalans offered him a trial less than an hour after the final in which Nigeria beat Spain 3-2.Okunowo earned himself a first-team promotion after just one season with Barca B and made 21 appearances in 1998-99 for Louis van Gaal’s La Liga-winning side.Unfortunately, those 21 appearances was all he ever had at the club. Okunowo\\'s career afterwards was unremarkable but could make every travel blogger drool: he\\'s been to Portugal, Greece, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Nigeria and even Maldives. England also appears on the Nigerian\\'s CV — thanks to a stint at eighth-tier Walthamstow FC; from playing next to Luis Figo to the bottom of the football pyramid.A few years ago, the club invited Samuel to participate in a Barca Legends charity match, where he met some of his former teammates.Centre-backs: Yaya Toure, Alex SongDefinitely one of Barca\\'s most iconic African players. Yaya Toure played a crucial role for both Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles within three years. We haven\\'t put Toure at centre-back for no reason –\\xa0that\\'s where he was forced to play the 2009 Champions League final, the biggest match of his career, due to injuries and suspensions of other players.The Ivorian had the potential to stay at the club for many years, but his relationship with Guardiola was too tense for that. Pep reportedly felt Yaya didn’t back him enough and opted to bet on 20-year-old Sergio Busquets, a decision heavily criticised by fans at the time. Although Toure\\'s exit was still considered a big loss, Guardiola\\'s bet paid off for everyone involved.Next to Yaya in our team is Alex Song. After a breakthrough 2011/12 season with Arsenal, in which he delivered 11 Premier League assists, the defensive midfielder signed for Barca as a backup for Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano. The Cameroonian never lived up to the expectations and spent two years on loan at West Ham before joining one of just three teams Leo Messi has ever failed to beat after seeing his contract ripped up.Song\\'s most memorable moment at Camp Nou would make an 8/10 Curb Your Enthusiasm episode. As Barca were about to lift the La Liga trophy, Song thought Carles Puyol wanted him to do it instead of Eric Abidal, who\\'d just come back from a liver transplant.In a recent interview, Song admitted he ‘didn’t give a f**k’ about playing at Barca and simply enjoyed the life of a billionaire. He has recently retired from football, ending his player career in… Djibouti.Left-back: Ez AbdeThe Moroccan was one of La Masia’s best attackers a few years ago and played a role in the second half of Xavi’s first season. Abde was so highly rated that even then-Spain boss Luis Enrique debated on which country he should represent.Following the breakthrough of Lamine Yamal and Fermin, Abde was forced to leave Barcelona again permanently. But one thing his La Masia peers would be jealous of is Abde\\'s knack for scoring bangers.Central midfielders: Seydou Keita, Franck KessieOne of the undeservedly less talked-about heroes of the Guardiola era. Keita was a versatile midfielder with a great first touch, vision, and an underrated ability to score goals –\\xa0he found the net 22 times in 4 years at the club.\"He never plays poorly. He makes my job easier,\" Pep once said about the Malian. Even when the relationship got tense between the two and the player barely had any game time, Guardiola would assure Seydou would stay as he is ‘the most generous player’ Pep had ever known.What happened to one of Barca\\'s most underrated footballers ever and Pep Guardiola\\'s first signing? AnsweredThe one to play alongside Keita would be Franck Kessie. Cules would forever be grateful to the Ivorian for scoring a late winner in the biggest Clasico of the 2022/23 season. One of the most glorious episodes of Xavi’s time at Barca, for sure.Despite only spending a year at the club, the Ivorian proved himself as a true professional, never complaining about his back-up role and agreeing to leave when the club needed money from his sale.\"I miss the support of the fans Barca fans,\" said Kessie not long after leaving. \"I try to give Barcelona all my support and follow every game.\"Right winger: Munir El HaddadiIt’s quite shocking to realise the former wonderkid is nearly 30…The Moroccan forward was part of Barcelona for a long eight years, winning 11 trophies and serving as a decent backup most of the time\\xa0– 12 goals and 11 assists across 52 appearances for one of the best Barca sides is not what many footballers achieve.Munir was seen as the perfect Luis Enrique player given his diligence and ruthlessness in front of goal. However, once the treble-winning coach left the club, his trusted soldier immediately followed suit — partly because despite brief spells of good form, he never really unleashed his potential in full.Munir reminded the Barca crowd of his existence in early 2023 when he scored against Blaugrana with a thrilling Las Palmas side. Aptly, the one who assisted him was another ex-La Masia talent Sandro.Left winger: Pierre-Emerick AubameyangStreets will never forget how good the Gabonese was under Xavi and what kind of effort he put in to join Barca. He bagged 13 goals in just half a season, massively contributing to the Catalans\\' top-4 finish in a challenging campaign.Even though Auba will probably hang up his boots soon, he is still capable of recording over 20 goal contributions per season, proving this at Marseille.Strikers: Samuel Eto\\'o, Emmanuel AmunikeThe Cameroonian is a cult figure for Barca. He is still 5th on the list of Blaugrana\\'s all-time top goalscorers — ahead of Rivaldo, Hristo Stoichkov, Neymar — and there are no signs anyone would beat him in the near future.Eto\\'o is also the only player on this list to have ever played for Real Madrid. He had been part of the Whites from 1996 to 2000 and had a chance to come back after his successful time at Mallorca. He didn\\'t want that comeback at all, though, revealing later that he hadn’t felt respected by Real Madrid’s academy teammates and suggesting their club didn\\'t like black people.Emmanuel Amunike is the final name in our XI. A hero of the 1996 Olympics won by Nigeria, the forward shortly signed for Barca to make the difference up front. But just like his fellow Nigerian teammate Okunowo, Amunike fell victim to great competition —\\xa0Louis van Gaal had Rivaldo, Hristo Stoichkov, Luis Figo and Luis Enrique at his disposal.Nonetheless, Emmanuel had one really special moment in the Blaugrana shirt — scoring the winner in the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain.Amunike hung up his boots after short spells at Albacete and in Jordan, but his trophy cabinet is impressive nonetheless: two La Liga titles, Copa del Rey, Olympic gold, African Cup of Nations, CAF Champions League and even the African Player of the Year award.How do you like the team?

This is the second time the Toffees are charged, with the first one resulting in a ten-point deduction.Chelsea have spent over £1bn on transfers in a year and a half under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. Fans are worried whether the Blues will be hit with charges and sanctions as well.However, as per David Ornstein, there's nothing to worry about at the moment, although Chelsea would need to change their approach going forward.The reporter said on The Athletic Football Podcast: “A lot of people have been saying ‘what is going on with Chelsea?’ Because their spend has been unprecedented since the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital ownership came on board. A bit of housekeeping to explain how they are compliant this time around.“They will have to be careful going forwards, because the costs will continue and it will be interesting to see how they balance the books after the Premier League capped amortisation of transfer fees, from no cap, to a cap of five years.“We will all be watching closely to see if they sell someone like Conor Gallagher in January because those homegrown players represent pure profit. Whether you like it or not, they’ve actually done quite well financially to fall within the limits.”So basically it means that Chelsea would no longer be able to spread transfer fees over seven- or eight-year periods as they did with the likes of Enzo Fernandez. No matter the length of the contract, the player's transfer fee could be amortised over five years maximum.Premier League CEO confirms status of investigation into Chelsea spending, 2024-01-17T14:49:48.000Z, The Athletic Football Podcast\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-26-bookies-name-top-favourites-to-succeed-jurgen-klopp-at-liverpool/, nan, Bookies name top favourites to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp has announced his FC Liverpool exit and the club will be on the hunt for a tremendous job to replace the living legend.

Imagine being able to place bets on your favorite sports teams or matches from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks and without the hassle of traditional currency. But what exactly is driving this digital transformation, and how does it affect the average sports fan?The Allure of Anonymity and EfficiencyOne big reason people use cryptocurrency for betting is the anonymity it provides. Whether you're trying to keep your hobby private or you just prefer an extra layer of security, betting with digital currencies can give you that peace of mind. Plus, when we talk about speed in sports, we're not just referring to the athletes. Transactions with cryptocurrency are lightning-fast compared to bank transfers. This means you can place a bet just minutes before a game starts or quickly cash out your winnings once the final whistle blows. These features are real game-changers for those who like to ride the adrenaline wave of live sports betting.Blockchain Technology’s Winning Goal in BettingFor those not already in the loop, blockchain is the tech behind cryptocurrency, and it's about as revolutionary as when sports broadcasts made the leap from radio to television. It's not just about faster transactions; blockchain brings an unprecedented level of security and transparency to betting. Smart contracts, for example, automatically execute wagers when certain conditions are met, ensuring that payouts are fair and timely. No more worries about if the house will pay up—blockchain technology is the referee that makes sure every play is fair.The New Era of Sports Fandom With Digital BetsWith the accessibility of crypto betting sites, we're witnessing a new era in sports fandom. It's not just about rooting for your team anymore; now, fans across the globe are placing bets on matches in real time, increasing the stakes and the excitement of each game. In addition, these platforms often foster a sense of community where sports fans can share tips, celebrate victories, and even commiserate over losses. For many, it's this social connectivity in the digital age that enhances the sports betting experience and keeps them coming back for more.The Balance Sheet of Crypto Sports BettingIt's not all about cheering from the sidelines, though. There's real money at play here, and with the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the risks are as real as the potential rewards. Betting with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies means staying informed about the market and making educated wagers to keep your finances in good shape. While the learning curve might be steep for new users, those who take the time to understand how it all works could find themselves in possession of more than just bragging rights when their team wins.Staying Onside With RegulationsIn the world of sports, rules are there for a reason, and the same goes for betting. The legality of using cryptocurrency for gambling varies across the board, so it's critical to understand the laws of the game where you are. And beyond the letter of the law, there's an ethical dimension to this discussion. The increased accessibility and ease of use that crypto betting sites offer could encourage responsible gambling but could also pose a risk to susceptible individuals. It's in the industry's best interest to promote fair play, not just within the sports themselves but in the betting that surrounds them.So there you have it, a dive into the wave of change that cryptocurrency has brought into the sports betting arena. It’s an exciting time, with the digital and the physical realms of sports intermingling more than ever before. Whether you're a seasoned bettor or a curious onlooker, one thing is clear: the combination of sports passion and crypto innovation is redefining what it means to be a fan in today’s world., 2024-01-30T04:15:55.000Z, nan\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-19-thanks-for-revenge-barca-fans-shower-griezmann-in-praise-after-atleti-knock-madrid-out-of/, Aleksei Blokhin, \\'Thanks for revenge\\': Barca fans shower Griezmann in praise after Atleti knock Madrid out of Spanish Cup, Barcelona advanced to the Spanish Cup quarter-finals after defeating Unionistas.

As if it wasn’t boring already, Jurgen Klopp’s departure from Liverpool is only supposed to make life easier for the Spaniard and his well-oiled machine (no pun intended).But one day, Pep will step down and someone else will have to replace him — why can’t it be a British manager? They don’t say cerveza to mean beer, but they know a thing or two about football.Let’s not beat about the bush: we have selected the 11 finest British managers of this century and ranked them according to their capacity to replace Pep Guardiola at Man City. Read on!Tony PulisIf you think us foolish enough to put Tony Pulis into the top tier for memes, think again — we’re not here to play to the gallery. Because let’s face it: Tony Pulis would be a horrible successor to Pep.It’s not even Tony’s Route One football that wouldn’t suit Man City or the fact Bernardo Silva’s ballerina hands are no match to Rory Delap’s muscles. It’s that he would bore Man City players to death with stories about his time at Gillingham in 1996.\\xa0Even when you listen to Pulis crack stories on a podcast you feel like you’re missing out on most jokes because you just weren’t there when Pulis got the Gills promoted from the Third Division.Tony Pulis — sacked in the morning (at Man City)!David MoyesWe’ll say it — David Moyes is vastly underrated. You’ve got the entire Premier League fondling Ange Postecoglou’s second chin for going suicidal v Chelsea and saying ‘mate’ but not a peep about the Scotsman who’s doing a tremendous job at West Ham. For three years running, Moyes got the Hammers into Europe, and an actual trophy is the cherry on the cake.\\xa0David’s only shot at a top club job went tits up, although let’s be honest: only a 61-year-old Sir Alex Ferguson would’ve adequately replaced Fergie at 71. For this reason, the jury is still out on Moysey, but he’d definitely be good enough to bring a trophy to Man City.Sean DycheIt’s a huge myth that Sean Dyche is a dinosaur that can only count the sum of four plus four plus two. At one point in the 2023/24 campaign, Dyche’s Everton had a better xG than Guardiola’s Man City. Now imagine what happens if Dyche has Erling Haaland instead of Neal Maupay up front.Fine, maybe Dyche doesn’t replace Guardiola completely, but he’s good enough to do a domestic cup double. And he also has a superior taste in music.Brendan RodgersIf Brendan Rodgers is good enough to win the FA Cup with Leicester City, he’s good enough to do it with Man City.Rodgers is so in love with Spain and Spanish football he probably guzzles Estrellas when on holiday. Of all clubs, Rodgers had the balls to try tiki-taka at Swansea City.\\xa0His Swans were actually everybody’s flavour of the mouth in 2011/12, though quite often it was possession for the sake of it: even the relegated duo of Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers each outscored 11th-placed Swansea that season.Finally, for all the great character spiel, Rodgers’ teams have a nasty record of mentally collapsing in the second half of the season — the opposite of Guardiola’s Man City. For this reason, we only put Brendan in the second tier.Sam AllardyceWe’ll have you know that Samuel Allardyce is one of the most progressive coaches of the Premier League era. He was among the first to leverage the use of data to gain an advantage over his opponents. When half the league still regarded the good ol’ 4-4-2 as God’s plan, Big Sam introduced psychotherapists, an in-house psychologist and a cryo-chamber at Bolton.\\xa0Allardyce also knows how to work with star players. He convinced World Cup winner Youri Djorkaeff and Real Madrid’s former captain Fernando Hierro to join his modest Bolton side. Big Sam even managed to get the best out of El Hadji Diouf — the cantankerous Senegalese called him ‘a good man, like a daddy’. Results followed: for three years in a row, the Wanderers were on the heels of the traditional top four.You might point out that Big Sam’s latest stints weren’t as successful as his Bolton years, but that’s because he’s not given the chance he deserves. As he himself pointed out: “I won’t ever be going to a top-four club because I’m not called Allardici, just Allardyce”.Some people luck into top jobs, while others get nothing even after decades of hard work. We’re convinced Big Sam would do a stellar job to replace Pep Guardiola at Man City — he only needs that chance.Tim SherwoodIf Tim Sherwood were awarded a point for everything he has an opinion about, he’d make City champions with 105 points. Alas, that’s not how football works, so Tactics Tim should keep providing soundbites for TalkSPORT.Steve BruceWhere do we even begin with Steve Bruce? Probably by giving him his due: few managers reach 1,000 games.\\xa0But how long would Bruce last at Man City? A few days maybe and not because he’s a Man United legend, but rather because he doesn’t seem to know what he wants. He said in late 2023: “I'm itching to go back in, not necessarily as a manager [...] I'd like to get back involved in some capacity [...] Maybe consultancy... something along those lines. That sporting director role rings a nice bell for me.”In addition, City players might be underwhelmed by Bruce’s tactical understanding. Don’t get us wrong, Steve Bruce is a genuinely good man, but it’s hard to imagine Rodri taking instructions like ‘hoof it, lad’ from the touchline.Alan PardewBy all means, Alan Pardew is not a bad manager. His French-speaking Newcastle United side were one of the most entertaining in the Premier League in the early 2010s, and he was also a Jesse Lingard dab away from winning the FA Cup and doing the second dance of the day.However, Pards’ latest spells at CSKA Sofia and Aris Thessaloniki, of all places, have been subpar — just like Sam Allardyce’s short-lived spells at Leeds and West Brom, you may point out. But where Big Sam has bags of self-confidence and extravagance, Alan Pardew has a list of controversies and a Swedish wife.Neil WarnockDifferent philosophies, same inspiration. If Guardiola goes, Neil Warnock must be the first name on the Sheikh’s replacement list.Hear us out: no one reaches 1,626 games in English football, the all-time record for a manager, by being incompetent. Just like no one else carries signed pictures of himself in a bumbag — not even Pep Guardiola.Neil Warnock also holds the record for most promotions in English football (8), which would be a valuable skill if Man City are eventually sent to the National League for cooking the books.Unless you’re a Leeds United fan, what’s not to like about Neil Warnock?Gareth SouthgateGareth Southgate is a special case: he’s England’s most successful manager in the XXI century, but no top club would touch him with a bargepole. We insist he’s not as bad as people want him to be and he might actually be a decent pick for Man City. With some luck in a penalty shootout he might even nick a trophy.By the way, Southgate was the Middlesbrough manager on the day they famously thrashed Man City 8-1 in 2008. Gareth Southgate might not be an adequate replacement for Pep Guardiola, but at least he’d go a full circle.Frank LampardIt’s always a great story when a legendary player leads his team to success as a manager, so how cool it would be for Man City legend Frank Lampard to repeat the trick.Lamps may have lucked himself into the Chelsea job in 2019, but hey, he still managed a top-four finish with a transfer ban and without Eden Hazard. This alone leaves Tim Sherwood without a company in the bottom tier of our rankings.However, Frank’s career afterwards went downhill. He seems to keep targeting jobs well above his ability and Everton’s massive improvement under Sean Dyche exposes the difference in their respective levels.Would you swap any places in our ranking?

His approach to counter-attacking involves a team effort centered around directness, physicality and quick decisions on when to release the ball to a teammateMourinho's teams are also known for their defensive compactness, which allows them to recover quickly into counter-attacking situations.Biggest weaknessesChelsea's new project under Todd Boehly has a heavy focus on youth players. The Blues have the youngest squad in the Premier League and this is something Mourinho is not used to. The 61-year-old might find it hard to work with such a young team.The Portuguese prefers to work with experienced players and is notorious for not giving youngsters enough time and space to prove themselves. Mo Salah and Kevin de Bruyne both left Chelsea after not getting enough minutes under Mourinho.At Roma though, Mourinho showed that he can adapt to circumstances, giving as many as 13 players their senior debuts. That was probably forced by the club's financial struggles — but it means that he can adapt to Chelsea's new policy.The question is whether the youngsters at Chelsea would accept the Portuguese demanding 110% out of each player not just in every game but in every training session. John Obi Mikel and Joe Cole argued that only Conor Gallagher would 'survive' in Mourinho's Chelsea team of their playing days.Biggest strengthsMourinho became the embodiment of Chelsea's culture of winning in the Roman Abramovich era. The Portuguese kept delivering at other clubs (except Spurs), winning the Conference League with Roma in 2022 despite operating on a low budget.The 61-year-old is also excellent at setting up defence. This is something that Chelsea have struggled with recently (40 goals conceded in 20 league games this season). Last season, his Roma side conceded just 38 goals in the same number of Serie A games despite goalkeeper Rui Patricio having a poor season (conceding 6.5 more goals than the xG of shots Roma faced).Possible Chelsea lineupsLet's imagine that Mourinho replaces Pochettino right now. He'll inherit a squad full of youngsters and injured players. We can see the Portuguese building the team around the most experienced players like Sterling and Thiago Silva, in addition to Gallagher, who looks like a perfect player for Jose.Mourinho likes playing with a traditional no. 9 and Chelsea have one — but he's not at the club right now. Yes, it's him. Romelu Lukaku is currently on loan at Roma but nothing prevents Mourinho from playing him next season if he becomes the Blues manager.Thiago Silva is out of the lineup as his contract expires this summer. The Portuguese would probably try to keep the veteran defender but it's hard to see him staying at the moment.Here is what Chelsea's starting would look like with Lukaku and no injuries next season under Mourinho., 2024-02-16T08:03:00.000Z, Tribuna\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-11-no-bellingham-real-madrid-name-23man-squad-for-rb-leipzig-clash/, Kosta König, No Bellingham: Real Madrid name 23-man squad for RB Leipzig clash, Real Madrid have announced their 23-man squad for Tuesday's Champions League clash against RB Leipzig away from home.Goalkeepers: Andriy Lunin, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Fran Gonzalez.Defenders: Nacho, Ferland Mendy, Fran Garcia, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vazquez, Alvaro Carrillo, Jacobo Ramon.Midfielders: Aurelien Tchouameni, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Dani Ceballos, Arda Guler, Mario Martin, Nico Paz.Forwards: Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr, Joselu, Brahim Diaz.Thibaut Courtois, Eder Militao, David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger and Jude Bellingham are injured., 2024-02-11T20:14:00.000Z, Real Madrid CF\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-26-petrovic-8-madueke-4-chelsea-player-ratings-in-villa-draw/, Aleksei Blokhin, Petrovic 8, Madueke 4: Chelsea player ratings in Villa draw, Chelsea and Aston Villa drew the FA Cup Fourth Round game 0-0. There will be a replay at Villa Park. Here's how we rated the players today.Petrovic: 8/10. Terrific display by the Serbia goalie. The second-half save on Matty Cash was something else. Gives you the calmness that Sanchez doesn't and should keep his spot when the Spaniard is back to full fitness.Gilchrist: 7. Had to start at short notice, with Colwill getting injured in the warm-up. Put in a very decent shift defensively, making vital blocks and interceptions. Was unlucky when Villa scored early in the first half but VAR spared his blushes.Gallagher: 7. Lead the press, suffocating Villa's defence. Great movement, arriving in the box exactly when he was needed.Badiashile: 7. Adds solidity to the backline. His long-range passes are something special, too.Sterling: 6.5. Played some really good passes. Occasionally excellent in one-on-ones but lost the ball too. Looked gassed after the break.Caicedo: 6. Good defensively but offered absolutely nothing in possession, just playing the ball to the closest teammate.Palmer: 5.5. Had a mare similar to the first leg against Boro. Bad miss after he was gifted a chance by Villa in the first half, even worse miss in the middle of the second half. Great creativity though.Chilwell: 5. Had no impact in the game after coming on shortly after the hour's mark. Was expected to do more as one of the most experienced players in the squad.Broja: 4. Had a chance late in the game after coming on but wasted it making a really, really poor first touch.Madueke: 4. Wasted an easy chance shortly after Villa's disallowed goal and another one later in the first half. Oftentimes was frustrating to watch as it looks like Noni makes the worst decision out of all possible options. Was fouled the whole game but the ref almost never gave a thing for some reason.

Nearly scored a brilliant individual goal after nutmegginng Witsel early in the first half. Produced a brilliant Zidanesque dribble shortly after the break. Then provided a brilliant assist for Joselu allowing Madrid to level the score for the second time.Joselu: 7.5. Right place, right time. Excellent positioning to score the header to equalise for Madrid late in the second half.Kroos: 7. Toni coming on changed the game for the better for Madrid as the Whites had more structure and organisation in the middle of the pitch. Excellent defensively too.Modric: 6. Scored a free-kick, with the help of Oblak, to equalise for Madrid but otherwise could have done better. Looked very leggy today.Rodrygo: 5.5. Not as involved as he would have liked.Rudiger: 5. It wasn't deliberate but his header ended up being a perfect assist for Griezmann. Shaky on a few other occasions. Difficult to blame him for the second goal though, the ball fell against him after Lunin tried to push it away.Camavinga: 5. Made a lot of mistakes and didn't connect the midfield with the forwards as expertly as he could. Barely jogged back to help Vinicius when Atleti scored their third goal — despite playing at left-back at that time.Tchouameni: 4.5. Had an off game today. Didn't bother to track back for Atleti's third goal, had very little impact going forward.Lunin: 4. Could have done better to claim the ball just before Atleti scored the opener. Really sloppy in the Morata goal, should have just caught the ball or pushed it away somewhere. Excellent save on Morata in the 82nd minute to keep Madrid in the game.Vinicius: 3. Wasted a brilliant chance early on after the ball fell to him following Bellingham's shot. Also missed an easy chance after Rodrygo was denied — although Vini was the man who created that chance for his fellow Brazilian in the first place.

Here's how our players performedVincius — 8The Brazilian winger seemed tired coming into this game but he was a terror to Las Palmas' defence all game. He grabbed the equalizer for us and almost scored 15 minutes later but his shot was deflected for a corner. That corner led to Madrid's winner via Tchouameni. Kroos —  7Toni Kroos worked hard today. Despite his age, the German was playing as a box-to-box midfielder covering a lot of ground for Real Madrid. He didn't look slow and never seemed to miss a pass. His crowning moment was that pinpoint corner for birthday boy Tchouameni to score the winner. Camavinga — 7Camavinga was tasked with playing in defensive midfield with Tchouameni rested and he didn't disappoint anyone. The Frenchman won most of his tackles and often played the right ball to put Real Madrid on the front foot. One of those moments saw him play a worldie of a pass for Vinicius to score the equalizer. Rodrygo — 4 Today we watched a tired Rodrygo. He was damn lucky to avoid a red card as early as the 4th minute of the game when he seemingly lost his head. It's hard to remember what special thing Rodrygo did on the pitch before being subbed off in the 81st minute. We can only expect better from him. Ceballos — 3Dani Ceballos was the man chosen to replace Valverde who was rested on the day and the Spaniard made us miss Fede so much. Over the course of 59 minutes he spent on the pitch he basically did nothing to write about. Thankfully he didn't cost us a penalty in the first half. Nacho — 1What do we say about captain Nacho? The less said about his errors the better. Today he made one again as he was there to deflect the ball beyond Lunin for Las Palmas' first goal against Madrid in 6 years. Real Madrid eventually came back to win which meant that mistake doesn't haunt us.

As a player, you are told if you are offside, don’t get involved. He interferes with Lunin – even if the push is little – and he was offside.\"A look from another angleIndeed, the footage reveals that the player behind Lunin was impeding the keeper, constituting interference while being in an offside position. Therefore, it was the right call to disallow the goal.

In the 21st minute, Mark Flekken\\'s goal kick went straight through the City defence, and Maupay slotted it past Ederson.City players protested for offside against both Maupay and Ivan Toney. Maupay was offside when the goal kick was taken, and Toney, coming from an offside position, blocked Nathan Ake from intercepting the long ball. However, Sky Sports commentator Seb Hutchinson clarified that awarding the goal was the correct decision.\"I think some of the City players had to be explained that rule as well. If Toney had touched it, it would have been offside. But he left it.\"When it comes to a goal kick, players can\\'t be offside. This means that Toney\\'s part in the play, where he challenged Ake without touching the ball, and Maupay running onto the ball, were both allowed. If Toney had touched the ball before it reached Maupay, then Maupay would have been considered offside because the ball wouldn\\'t have come directly to him from the goal kick.\\'We\\'ve checked the club badge.

Most Barca fans will remember Rijkaard. The Dutch tactician was in charge at Barca between 2003 and 2008. After getting sacked he moved to Turkey where he managed Galatasaray for about a year before also being shown the door. The worry is that Rijkaard has not managed at the top level for more than 10 years. His last managerial job of note ended in 2013 when he was sacked by Saudi Arabia after being their coach for 14 matches. The 61-year-old has since abandoned football to start a thriving hospitality business. Thus, reports say he's reluctant to return to football management. Laporta is exploring the possibility of Rijkaard managing Barca alongside Dutch legend Marco Van Basten. Rijkaard led Barcelona to a Champions League and La Liga triumph in 2006.

Al Ittihad are not ready to let him go that easily and Benzema has high wage demands of his own. Also signing a 36-year-old will be against the policy of signing younger players under Mauricio Pochettino.However, in football, you can never say never. Jordan Henderson has already reportedly agreed to leave Al Ettifaq after a frustrating loan spell and Benzema could be next in line.Going by that, here we look at the two ways Chelsea can line up with the French forward for the rest of the season.Option 1: Benzema up frontThe Ballon d’Or winner has excelled in his career in playing as a no.9. He is not the ordinary box striker, but someone who thrives in dropping deep to help link up plays before getting into the box to finish off moves.Having scored 432 goals in his career, Benzema could be exactly the kind of prolific striker Chelsea need to push for trophies and a possible top-4 or top-6 finish in the Premier League. He can also get more assists out of Cole Palmer and combine nicely with fellow Frenchman Christopher Nkunku.Option 2: In two-man forward linePochettino has opted against playing a two-man forward line in a 4-4-2 formation at Chelsea so far, but that can change with someone like Benzema. The ex-Real Madrid striker could play just ahead of Nkunku in a two-man forward line, with the wide areas being occupied by Palmer and Raheem Sterling. This could be for weaker oppositions or when Chelsea are in desperate need of goals and needs to go into an all-out-attack mode., 2024-01-17T14:00:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-02-05-liverpool-get-wataru-endo-boost-after-his-elimination-from-asian-cup/, Uttiyo Scarnage, Liverpool get Wataru Endo boost after his elimination from Asian Cup, Wataru Endo saw his AFC Asian Cup journey come to an end when his Japan side suffered a loss to Iran in the quarter-finals on Saturday (February 3).As a result, he has now returned to England and is going to be available to play for Liverpool after the loss to Arsenal.As per David Lynch, the Japanese midfielder is set to return to training on Monday (February 5) and has returned from the Asian Cup without any problems.Endo had earned eight consecutive starts for the Reds before having to travel to Qatar for the continental competition last month.With some injuries bugging Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp will probably be pleased to have the combative midfielder back in the midst.Endo should be fully fit and readily available for the upcoming Premier League game against Burnley at the weekend.Endo admits he was 'little bit lucky' after winning Liverpool December POTY'I needed to show why I'm here': Wataru Endo reacts after being voted Liverpool's Player of the Month for December, 2024-02-05T14:52:00.000Z, ThisIsAnfield\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-02-01-chelsea-fans-livarpool-premier-league-want-klopp-fairytale-story/, Aleksei Blokhin, Chelsea fans: \\'LiVARpool ...

Flick is surely about control, with his Bayern side averaging 60.2 per cent possession in 2020/21, but not as much as Xavi, whose Barca average around 65 per cent in 2023/24.Unlike at Quique Setien’s Barca (average possession of 74 per cent), there is no passing just for the sake of passing — Flick’s team would often attempt crosses and long balls from deep positions as the main idea is to generate a lot of chances and feed forwards with balls.Flick’s favoured formation is 4-2-3-1. Barca are already well prepared to line up this way on a permanent basis: Xavi used this set-up at the beginning of the season when he fielded Oriol Romeu and Frenkie de Jong in the same line-up —\\xa0it worked very well before the Dutchman got sidelined.Undoubtedly, Flick excels at unlocking his team’s attacking potential. Flick’s Bayern scored a whopping 260 goals in just 86 games, only failing to score once. Robert Lewandowski felt particularly comfortable under Flick, finding the net 83 times in just 71 appearances.Naturally, the downside of Flick’s aggressive tactics is defending. Hansi’s risky approach with a high defensive line often cost his Bayern team as they were hit in transition after losing possession in the build-up. This resulted in Flick's side conceding slightly above a goal per game.It’s interesting what roster Hansi would like to have at his disposal, given Barca’s delicate financial situation. First, let’s think about a potential eleven without any new signings.Line-up 1 Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; De Jong, Gavi; Yamal, Gundogan, Pedri; Lewandowski.Two attack-minded wing-backs (who would naturally make the team’s wing defending more vulnerable), tireless defence-minded midfield and a great attacking support for Robert Lewandowski —\\xa0something that worked very well at Bayern.Line-up 2Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, De Ligt, Balde; Kimmich, Thiago; Yamal, Gundogan, Pedri; Lewandowski.If given the chance, Flick will probably want his defence and midfield to be strengthened. Matthijs de Ligt is still said to be dreaming of joining Barca and would replace one of the underperforming centre-backs; Joshua Kimmich would be Barca’s long-term solution for the defensive midfield; Thiago Alcantara is the one Flick actually called his ‘favourite player’ before Germany faced Spain at the 2022 World Cup.It would be refreshing to see this Barca side in action.❓ Would you like to see Hansi Flick coaching Barca next season?

The 45-year-old holds the record for the most World Cup goals, with 16 spread across four competitions, from 2002 to 2014.Quoted by Sport Bild, Klose said: \"I had predicted at least 20 to 25 goals for Harry [this season], but even that was too low. What impresses me most is his shooting technique. If I had only five per cent of that, I would probably have scored 30 World Cup goals!\"\"He is so precise and skilful when it comes to finishing. It\\'s just like a tennis player when he serves. What the tennis player does with his wrist, Harry Kane does with his foot and ankle.\"\"He always has the same posture, but he swings his foot differently. The goalkeepers cannot predict where the shot will go. It’s wonderful.\"Kane might break Klose\\'s World Cup record before he retires. The 30-year-old England captain has eight goals from two tournaments, winning the Golden Boot in 2018.

Here's how are players faredJoselu - 9Today was Joselu's day to show Madridistas just what he's all about. The 33-year-old was a destructive force for that Getafe defence all game and was duly rewarded with a well-taken brace. The Spaniard could've added an assist if Vinicius was a little more clinical with his cutback. Bellingham - 8One thing Jude Bellingham will never be accused of in his career is a lack of effort. The midfielder put in a shift and was too powerful for Getafe's athletic midfield. He didn't score but he also didn't lose the ball, misplace a pass or dibbled past. It was a top performance by Jude once again. Vazquez - 7.5Lucas Vazquez started the party for Real Madrid with that sublime cross for Joselu to open the scoring. Some Real Madrid fans couldn't believe he had that in his locker. Vazquez continued to probe and could've added two more assists to his name if Joselu was luckier. It was a good performance from the Spaniard. Modric - 7Luka Modric continues to age like fine wine. Once again the Croatian showed his quality as he played as the number 8 in Real Madrid's four-man midfield. He barely gave the ball away and set his team on the move with his incredible passing range. Lunin - 7Perhaps Lunin has cemented his place as Real Madrid's first-choice goalie. He was neat and tidy in goal against Getafe and smothered everything that came his way. Madrid's defence did not panic knowing their goal was secured by safe hands from Ukraine. Vinicius - 5The Brazilian was not at his clinical best today. In the first half, Vini missed a huge chance when put one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He was easily shut down by the Getafe defence. He gets a rating of 5 for his sublime assist for Joselu's second goal. It's what top players do, even on their off day they still manage to affect the game somehow. Other players.

Answered, Manchester United have been rocked by the news of Anthony Martial's groin surgery that requires him to be out of action for at least the next 10 weeks. Given his poor injury record, Martial is expected to take longer than that to recover fully. He's only appeared in 13 Premier League games this season, mostly off the bench. In other words, it looks like Martial may not play for Man United again until his contract expires this summer. Considering he earns £250,000 a week, that's an expensive non-playing player to have on your books. But why are the Red Devils simply not terminating Martial's contract as they did with Cristiano Ronaldo? We saw a few of these queries from fans on social media as well as from our users. To clear it up, both parties (in this case Man United and Martial) need to agree to terminate his contract. His agent has, unfortunately, confirmed that Martial is going nowhere this month and will see out his contract at Old Trafford. In Ronaldo's case, the Portuguese superstar himself wished to leave. Thus, unless Martial and his camp are willing, Man United have their hands tied in this situation.

Mbappe is asking for a yearly salary of €50m gross (€25m net) and a sign-on bonus of €120m if he's to leave PSG. Furthermore, Mbappe wants a percentage of his image rights which brings in around €100m per season. Real Madrid are yet to agree to Mbappe's demands and that explains why the player is reluctant to publicly announce he will leave PSG. Mbappe currently earns €72m gross per year at PSG and is guaranteed a loyalty bonus worth €130m if he extends his contract with the Parisians. Mbappe forgave PSG €70m of that money to stay back at PSG without extending his contract last summer. But PSG will pay the rest if he doesn't leave in June. What it shows is that Mbappe is willing to take a pay cut to join Real Madrid but even at that he would be earning a stupendous amount of money if Florentino Perez meets his demands.

Pep immediately said: \"F**k\" on live TV. However, the legendary manager went on to provide some context. \"Doing it with Man City [was incredible], 15 or 20 years ago we were not here. We have built step by step since Roberto Mancini was here. Those years ago, we could not expect to be here,\" Guardiola.

It could be argued that the club desperately needed a hardline disciplinarian like Ten Hag. Player power has been shockingly on the rise at Old Trafford over the years. Since taking charge, Ten Hag has famously fallen out with several names. Let's begin from where it all started. Zidane IqbalThe former Academy player was a huge fan favourite but his training performances didn't impress Ten Hag one bit. Erik even called Iqbal 'f***ing rubbish' for not keeping the ball on the floor enough. Iqbal was not given a single minute of action the following season and he ended up joining FC Utrecht. Cristiano RonaldoThe biggest name on the list, Ronaldo famously called out Ten Hag for not giving him enough respect. Cristiano was not happy about being benched as he wished to play regularly. Erik had other ideas as he wanted to give everyone a chance. Few could argue that was the case though, as the Portuguese superstar's behaviour towards the end of his second spell had become intolerable. He refused to acknowledge fans, stormed out before games ended and no one can forget that Piers Morgan interview. Having threatened to undo Ten Hag's efforts at team-building, Ronaldo's contract was swiftly terminated. Marcus Rashford This might not exactly be a feud but it's worth including here to show not everything has to end negatively. Rashford was benched for a couple of games for showing up late to training sessions. Although Marcus' form hasn't been the best, he did what the others failed to do - he took it in his stride and apologised. The boss isn't one to carry things over as he quickly reinstated Rashford into the team again. Jadon SanchoNo one thought Sancho would leave Man United for something so trivial as gaming too much at 4am when he first signed for a fee of £73 million. Sadly, that's the downward slope his career went in. He was not focused enough on football causing a decline in his training output. Ten Hag called him out for underperforming, prompting Sancho to accuse him of 'scapegoating' and also called him a liar. Since then, Sancho refused to apologise and was exiled from the first-team as a result. He's now rejoined Borussia Dortmund on loan. Raphael VaraneAnother one unhappy with his game time, Varane and Ten Hag were at war of words earlier this season. The centre-back has been injured most of the campaign but he made a comeback in November. At the time, Erik preferred to play Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, citing tactical reasons. Varane was not pleased with being benched and confronted Ten Hag, which reportedly didn't end well. Earning £340,000-a-week in wages, the Frenchman is an expensive option to have on the bench. Anthony MartialAnd the latest to join the list, Martial has had it coming for a long time. After struggling to deliver the goods on the field, it's no surprise his training performances have drawn criticism. Now, it appears Ten Hag has ordered Martial to train alone until he regains the standards required of the first-team. It's unclear what the striker's future holds, with his current contract expiring at the end of this season., 2024-01-18T17:08:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-21-la-liga-name-isco-man-of-the-match-despite-ferrans-hattrick-and-assist/, Kosta König, La Liga name Isco Man of the Match despite Ferran Torres' hat-trick and assist, It's crazy, but it's Isco who has been chosen the Man of the Match of Real Betis - Barcelona!While the attacking midfielder bagged a brace, Ferran scored THREE and also got an assist for the winner.

The Italian successfully installed his philosophy at Shakhtar Donetsk who went on to win the Ukrainian Super Cup. Thus, De Zerbi became the first Italian manager to win a title in Ukraine.\\xa0After war broke out between Ukraine and Russia, De Zerbi didn’t find it difficult to land a decent job in the Premier League as Brighton’s gaffer. Fast forward to 2024, De Zerbi is now one of Europe's most talked about managers. So much so that he’s being linked with the top job in Barcelona and Liverpool, with Xavi and Jurgen Klopp declaring they have run out of energy.De Zerbi’s rise to prominence in such a short time stems from what his fine work at Brighton. The 44-year-old guided the Seagulls to a sixth-placed finish last season — their highest-ever finish in the Premier League. It also guaranteed them a place in Europe for the first time.De Zerbi’s style\\xa0Brighton has maintained their seductive brand of football playing their preferred 3-4-2-1 formation under Zerbi this season. It’s a system that utilizes all 11 players on the pitch with their goalkeeper averaging 50 touches per game. It’s why Brighton boasts 64% possession per match — by comparison, only Man City (66%) commands more possession of the ball than Brighton in the Premier League.\\xa0De Zerbi’s team have perfected the art of building up from the back, finding and exploiting gaps in their opponent’s midfield and defence. It’s why Brighton rarely struggle to create scoring chances, regardless of opponent. The Seagulls have created 48 big chances in the league this season alone.\\xa0De Zerbi’s team records 11.98 shots per game with an xG (expected goals) tally of 1.71 per game. That’s almost identical to Xavi’s Barca with an average of 13.35 shots and an xG of 1.98 per match. You don’t need reminding who has the better tools to perform.\\xa0\\xa0What’s more, De Zerbi’s team also excels when it comes to taking most of the chances they create. Only six teams in the Premier League have scored more goals this term than Brighton who average 1.8 goals per game.\\xa0One big weakness in De Zerbi’s teamIt’s their defence.\\xa0De Zerbi’s team concede a lot of goals when they’re hit in transition. It’s the natural drawback to playing out from the back or keeping a high line. We noticed that Brighton’s defence have made 7 errors leading to goals this term. They suffer when facing physical teams who set up in a low block and willingly surrender possession.\\xa0Thus, Brighton concedes 1.65 goals in the league and can only boast of two league clean sheets after 23 games this season. The only legislation for that anomaly is that De Zerbi’s Brighton usually outscores their opponents, plus their brand football is a joy to watch.\\xa0De Zerbi has been turning lemons into lemonades at Brighton and there’s no bigger club for such an ingenious tactician to do exactly that than Barca. The Blaugrana have continued to struggle with Financial Fair Play restrictions after plunging into a €1.2 billion debt. Still, they recently won La Liga and boast one of the most talented teams in Europe. De Zerbi could work wonders with such a team if handed the reins.\\xa0Provided Laporta and Deco can agree to make it happen, here are two ways De Zerbi can line up at Barca with his favourite formation.\\xa0Lineup 1Ter Stegen; Christensen, Araujo, Kounde; Balde, De Jong, Gundogan, Cancelo; Pedri, Yamal; Lewandowski\\xa0It’s conceivable that De Zerbi would start with the same three centrebacks Xavi successfully used in winning La Liga two seasons ago. Two flying full-backs would give the team the needed overload down the flanks.\\xa0In midfield, Barca already have the tools De Zerbi needs. A tireless workhorse like De Jong, and creators like Gundo and Pedri who can drift into forward positions to help the team.\\xa0Lineup 2Ter Stegen; Christensen, Araujo, Kounde; Balde, Gross, De Jong, Gavi; Felix, Yamal; LewandowskiDe Zerbi is likely to sanction a signing or two to further strengthen his team. Like most coaches who thrive on possession dominance, he’d be looking at midfielders to bring in. The easiest and cheapest from Brighton would be Pascal Gross. A veteran just like Gundogan but still a consistent and versatile performer.\\xa0What stops this Barca team from bullying Europe and winning the Champions League?❓ Would you like to see De Zerbi coaching Barca next season?

Towards the end of 2023, the football star departed Saudi Arabia without offering any explanations. Adding to the mystery, he deleted his Instagram account. Recently, Benzema was spotted in Mauritius in the company of his former wife, Chloé De Launay.The pictures suggest that this rendezvous goes beyond a casual catch-up.

Chloé and Karim met in 2008. The striker was still a goalscorer at Lyon at the time and had no idea that he would win the UCL five times.

The footballer had a fleeting affair with singer Rihanna, and at the end of 2016, Benzema became the husband of Cora Gauthier, with whom he has a son, Ibrahim.But here too, the Frenchman was not blessed with family happiness for long: in 2020 he briefly returned to Chloe, which resulted in the birth of his son Nouri.

The final confirmation is anticipated before the IFAB AGM in March.Howard Webb, the chief of Premier League referees, has been a vocal advocate of increased transparency since his tenure with PGMOL in 2022. He supports officials communicating decisions to fans in stadiums, a move towards a more open system similar to rugby's. However, approval from top-flight clubs is essential, and the ultimate decision rests with the Premier League AGM in June.The IFAB's approval for in-game explanations follows a year of trials worldwide. Referees, including Anthony Taylor, first utilized the system at the Club World Cup in Morocco 12 months ago, extending the trial to the men's under 20 World Cup and the women's World Cup later in the year.The explanations provided during trials, such as 'following a review, 9 was fouled by 12, penalty to England,' though basic, have proven effective in reducing confusion and frustration among fans in stadiums since the introduction of VAR.'People who wanted it realize it’s been a disaster': Football fans compare VAR to Brexit, 2024-01-31T08:58:37.000Z, Daily Mail\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-01-29-real-madrid-studying-replacing-mendy-with-highflying-castilla-castaway/, Kingsley_, Real Madrid studying replacing Mendy with high-flying Castilla castaway, Real Madrid have been studying the development of Miguel Gutierrez at Girona, per Marca.

Maybe we're aiming too high up the tree. A proper question would be, can Ferran ever become a world-class forward? Good examples of world class forwards include players like Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Vinicius Jr and Lautaro Martinez. Barca were hoping they got one when they paid €55m to get Ferran from Manchester City for the 23-year-old. That hasn't been the case. After two full years, the Blaugrana have only gotten 21 goals for the money they spent on the Spaniard. Even if you add the 12 assists he's registered so far, it's still a far cry from what you'll expect from an expensive forward after 98 games. Let's discuss what Ferran could change to sit on the table of Europe's elite forwards. FinishingFerran can do so much better with his shot accuracy and finishing. In many instances when he gets into excellent positions his finishing ability often lets him down. The Spaniard can hardly be faulted for his work rate as he often puts in the effort any coach would require, but he just doesn't bury it when everyone thinks he would. It's probably why Ferran is not expected to score so many goals even when he plays well. Stats show he's behind Every Barca forward but Lamine in terms of expected goals (xG). Even Gundugan who's a midfielder is expected to score more. PositioningFerran's positioning on the pitch often raises several questions. He drifts inside the striker's position when he doesn't need to and seldom provides the overload Barca desperately needs when he plays either on the left or right. Some don't believe he's better as a number 9 and I agree. The numbers don't lie just 2 goals in his career when playing centre-forward. In one episode during Barca's win against Osasuna in the Super Cup semi-final, Ferran's positioning was called out by an analyst who wondered why he doesn't move into the channels to provide an outlet for Barca like he was asked to do. Ferran drifts into the ST position. He should be widePerhaps Xavi could coach this blatant flaw by shouting at him from the sidelines. If Ferran improves his positing his goal contributions will improve massively. Even if he doesn't get to score, his assists stat would be better off, say even more than Raphinha who has seven assists despite struggling so much with injuries.

The 33-year-old is Barca's absolute best playmaker who consistently drops masterclasses week in, week out.Just look at this crazy difference in expected assisted goals [xAG] in all competitions this season:1. Ilkay Gundogan - 9.22. Lamine Yamal - 5.12. Raphinha - 5.14. Joao Cancelo - 4.75. Robert Lewandowski - 4.0Gundogan actually has his best-ever assist tally in Europe's top five leagues – nine. And there are four months of the season left.Lamine YamalAlthough Deco says the 16-year-old plays so much due to first-team injuries, the teenager proves he absolutely deserves the game time he receives.Lamine is surely Barca's most creative attacker – it's not just about created chances but also about the ability to beat opponents on the wing and carry the ball forward from deeper positions. He fills Blaugrana's games with joy only players like Leo Messi, Ronaldinho and Neymar used to give us.Lamine Yamal reveals watching one player's comps for inspiration –\\xa0not MessiInigo MartinezDespite making just 12 appearances for Barcelona so far, the experienced centre-back surprisingly proves to be the best choice in his position.One trait makes Inigo absolutely invaluable for Xavi –\\xa0his ability to send quality long balls into the opposition half. The 32-year-old created multiple chances this way while also looking solid and aggressive enough at the back. When he's fit, he is a game changer.Ferran TorresFerran's resurrection is truly impressive. He is possibly the Barca player with the healthiest mental state this season.The 23-year-old has covered every position in attack this term and registered 15 goal contributions in all competitions. Goalscoring-wise, he is still far from the numbers of Kylian Mbappe or Erling Haaland, but his goal-per-game rate looks decent.Frenkie de JongWe almost never see the Dutchman flop in a single game. He consistently looks great and crucial to Barca's midfield.This season, the 26-year-old is among La Liga's best players in the number of through balls and expected assists while expectedly registering plenty of progressive passes and runs., 2024-02-08T11:05:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-29-5-budget-options-from-afcon-barca-might-consider-as-their-next-signing/, Kosta König, 5 budget transfer options from AFCON Barca should consider as their next signing, Barcelona have sent their scouts to the Africa Cup of Nations to watch the likes of Pape Matar Sarr and Ousmane Diomande closely. The problem is these players all are beyond Barca's financial reach —\\xa0unless Joan Laporta somehow finds another lever to trigger. So bargain-hunting is a more realistic option for the club.We've come up with five quality budget options Deco could go for even in the final days of the January transfer window or in the summer.Aboubakary Koita, MauritaniaDoubts over the futures of Joao Felix and Ansu Fati will almost certainly force Barca to look for a left winger in the summer. Nico Williams was supposed to be one, but even an otherwise affordable release clause of €50m is beyond Barca's reach.Aboubakary Koita could be a decent alternative. The 25-year-old has 11 goals in 21 matches for Sint-Truiden, a mid-table side of the Belgian top tier. He is the league leader for successful take-ons, fouls drawn and progressive carries, which perfectly describes his style of play.Koita’s tactical transformation over the years is really impressive. This is his first season as a left winger; previously, he used to play as a wide midfielder on each side while also trying his luck in midfield. Reminds us of Bukayo Saka’s evolution.Shortly after making his debut for Mauritania, Koita scored the first goal for the national team, helping them advance to their first-ever AFCON knockouts after spending decades at the bottom of FIFA rankings.Koita’s current deal with Sint-Truiden expires in July 2025 which means he could be available at a low cost this summer. His estimated value is €5m.Logan Costa, Cape VerdeJust like the entire Cape Verde team, Logan Costa has been one of the biggest discoveries of this AFCON. Although his side conceded against Ghana and Egypt in the group stage, the 22-year-old was rock-solid on both occasions, recording six tackles and 10 clearances in two matches combined.What makes Costa a potentially perfect fit for Barca is the way he progresses with the ball forward –\\xa0he reminds us of Andreas Christensen in this respect. He’s not afraid to do it even against more high-profile opponents. His bravery against Egypt led to him providing two key passes.The centre-back plays for Toulouse who are famous for their AI-driven approach to recruiting players, so Costa isn't a random Joe. Last season, the Cape Verdean helped his team to the French Cup scoring two in the final.Logan’s contract with Toulouse ends in 2026, with the estimated price standing at €5m.Lamine Camara, SenegalAnother priority position to strengthen is the defensive midfield. Barca’s desperation almost forced them to sign Pep Guardiola’s outcast Kalvin Phillips, but even that move ended up being infeasible.Senegal’s rising star Lamine Camara is the one to watch. The player joined Metz from Generation Foot – the Senegalese side are strategic partners with the Ligue 1 club providing them with top-quality prospects, Sadio Mane being the best example.\\xa0Camara now averages more tackles, interceptions and blocks per 90 minutes than most midfielders in Europe’s top 5 leagues. Despite all that, he is more than just a ball winner: like Barca’s other target Aleix Garcia, the youngster can cover every position in midfield, succeeding as an attacking midfielder in the national team. He scored twice in Senegal’s opening AFCON match against Gambia, the second goal being an absolute stunner.Camara's current deal with Metz expires in 2026 and his estimated value is set at €4m.Kamory Doumbia, Mali‘We’ve got our own Jude Bellingham at home’ –\\xa0that’s what Joan Laporta can say if he lands the Malian one day.I’m not even exaggerating. Stat database Fbref names the Englishman as the one who's most similar to the 20-year-old —\\xa0largely thanks to his immense defensive contribution for a midfielder who bangs goals here and there.His goalscoring instincts aside, Doumbia’s strong attributes include dribbling and playmaking. He has delivered five key passes in his first three AFCON matches, two of which led to assists.Since 1988, only 17 players have ever received a 10/10 from L'Equipe, notorious for their harsh match ratings. The list has the likes of Leo Messi, Erling Haaland, Robert Lewandowski, and... Kamory Doumbia. This happened when the Malian hit four goals past Lorient in 2023/24 while playing as a central midfielder.Kamory’s contract with Reims (he’s currently on loan at Brest) expires in 2025, so a low-cost deal may be possible in the summer. His estimated cost is €2m.Jesus Owono, Equatorial GuineaMany Barca fans are getting tired of Inaki Pena’s inconsistency. Time to get a new backup for Marc-Andre ter Stegen?Jesus Owono is the real deal. After winning the Man of the Match against Nigeria, the Equatorial Guinea representative went on to deliver an assist (his SECOND this season) against Guinea-Bissau and keep a clean sheet against the tournament hosts Ivory Coast.Born in Equatorial Guinea, the 22-year-old began to play football in Spain, where he has spent most of his life. Owono is a second choice for Alaves in La Liga but starts in Copa del Rey, where he's kept three clean sheets in three matches, including one against Real Betis.Owono is among the players with the most saves made and the highest save percentage at this AFCON. He’s clearly in the form of his life – with his contract expiring this summer, Barca should act quickly.Which of these players should Barca consider? Would you recommend any other underrated African players to the club?, 2024-01-29T18:58:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-20-why-diogo-dalot-is-often-the-one-to-speak-to-media-after-games-revealed/, Meghna @ 1819, Why Diogo Dalot is often the one to speak to media after games — revealed, According to Samuel Luckhurst of the MEN, Manchester United staff fear they have become 'too dependent' on Diogo Dalot for post-match interviews. If one has noticed, Dalot has been one of the most prominent speakers in post-match engagements this season. He's also been doing an unusual number of interviews with club media. These interviews are usually distributed equally among the team as seen in previous seasons. The MEN understand that the staff believes Dalot is being 'overtaxed' but they don't have a choice.

But before we jump into the tips, remember, pokies are a game of chance, and there's no surefire way to guarantee a win. Responsible gambling is key - always play within your means and for fun.1. Understand the Game: Pokies aren't just about pushing buttons. Each game has its unique paytable and rules. Familiarise yourself with these before you start. Knowing what each symbol means and the various paylines can significantly enhance your experience.2. Start Small: Especially if you're a newbie, start with smaller bets. This approach lets you get the hang of the game without risking too much dough. Plus, it extends your playtime, which is half the fun!3. Eye on the Prize - Progressive Jackpots: If you're dreaming of the big win, progressive jackpots are where it's at. These pokies pool money over a network, creating massive jackpots. Remember, though, the odds are longer, and you often need to play the maximum bet to qualify.4. Take Advantage of Bonuses: Many Aussie pubs, clubs, and casinos offer bonuses or free spins on pokies. These can be a great way to get extra play without additional cost. However, always read the terms and conditions – there’s no such thing as free money!5. Know When to Say Ta-Ta: The biggest secret to pokies? Knowing when to walk away. Set a budget before you start and stick to it. If you hit a nice win, consider pocketing your initial stake and playing only with your winnings.6. Play for Fun, Not to Make Money: Remember, pokies are a form of entertainment, not a way to make a living. Enjoy the thrill, the lights, the sounds, and the excitement, but don't chase losses or play with the rent money.And lastly, if you or someone you know is struggling with gambling, don't hesitate to seek help. Responsible gambling is the best bet you'll ever make. So, spin those reels responsibly, and who knows? Lady Luck might just be on your side down under!Choosing the Best Online Pokies Australia Real Money Site for YouSelecting the ideal online pokies Australia real money sites doesn't happen by accident; it requires a keen eye for detail and understanding your personal preferences.

Besides their big debt to Ajax, Barca are also struggling to keep De Jong on their books with his current (€18m net) salary. Over the next two seasons, Barcelona must pay the Dutchman a staggering €77m in wages just to keep him. De Jong is expected to receive close to €30m in deferred wages this season alone. It's no secret that the midfielder has deferred his wages many times to help the club. Now it's time for Barca to pay up. Barca have come up with an ingenious plan to resolve the situation — extend the player's contract (until 2029) and amortise his salary over the remaining five years. But for that to happen, De Jong must agree to the plan and take a wage cut. Barca are offering De Jong a new base salary of €15m per season (net) which still has him as their top earner. But it's a considerable figure the club can live with. As it stands De Jong and his entourage are yet to come to the negotiating table, with Barca putting pressure.

Events such as Aaron Rodgers's unexpected injury and Josh Allen's audacious hail-mary passes are visible. In 2024, it’s time to sum up the major sports events of 2023 and the memes that appeared over the last season.\\xa0Sports Memes and Breaking News In 2023\\xa0Do you always want to know what is the biggest news in sports today? Well, you need to stay tuned. But if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of all things gaming, you also need streaming services. One is not enough, given the power outages and regional restrictions. If you had asked me what is the best source for sports news, I would have hesitated. For me it's Reddit, but if you prefer more official sources then ESPN.\\xa0To follow the sport, you will need a VPN. This way you can access all games, including local ones. Just be sure to choose a no-logs VPN so that your data can't be leaked, queried by the government, or sold. The first one that comes to mind is VeePN; it works well with streaming content and the service’s security is at the highest level. Moreover, VeePN has thousands of servers around the world and has a free trial period.\\xa0#1 Taylor Swift invades the NFL\\xa0Travis Kelce's notoriety in the NFL world soared to new heights once he began dating a global pop sensation. The Chiefs' formidable tight end was well-known, but pair him with an international music icon, and you've got an unprecedented fusion of sports and pop culture. Fans typically focused on chart-topping hits were suddenly breaking down football strategies while high-profile spats, like Aaron Rodgers' attempt at a vaccine-related controversy, failed to overshadow Kelce's newfound fame.\\xa0Amidst more televised celebrations of Swift's than game replays, one might view the relationship skeptically. However, it appears genuine, with both Kelce and the pop star seemingly enjoying a pleasant union. This crossover has not only maintained its momentum but also enlarged the fanbase for both the NFL and the music industry—a serendipitous win-win for the sports and entertainment sectors.\\xa0#2 Winning isn’t everything\\xa0In a display of athletic brilliance, the Raiders secured an impressive victory against the Chargers as they dominated the scoreboard with 42 points in the opening half of Week 15. Although they finished the game with a grand total of 63 points, the remarkable feat of scoring 42 within the first thirty minutes is one for the history books. Despite this, it's important to remember that triumphing in sports isn't the sole objective—though the Raiders certainly made a statement that day.\\xa0#3 Saudi sportswashing wins\\xa0Despite initial reluctance, the allure of substantial investment proved too irresistible for the sports industry. This year marked a monumental shift as the Saudi Arabian government successfully penetrated the sports sector. Elite soccer talent, with the exception of Messi, demonstrated willingness to compete in sparsely attended Saudi matches for the tantalizing promise of eight-figure salaries. The influence expanded as increasing numbers of sports teams came under Saudi proprietorship. The NBA did not dismiss the possibility of Saudi investment. In a staggering development, LIV Golf—a rival league that sliced through the golf world in 2022—stunned onlookers by declaring an intention to merge with the PGA. This left critics, Tiger Woods included, re-evaluating their opposition. If the thought of Steve Cohen as a contentious owner raises eyebrows, the idea of a Saudi-backed fund purchasing major league baseball or NFL teams takes the debate to new heights. Based on current trends, such a scenario may unfold sooner than anticipated.\\xa0#4 Rise of women’s sports\\xa0The longstanding belief that women's sports would thrive with increased visibility and media coverage seems to be more than just a theory—it's a reality. This year’s triumphs in women's sports underscore this point vividly. Take, for instance, the awe-inspiring success of the Women's World Cup, which captivated audiences globally despite the US team's unexpected results. Then there was the record-shattering volleyball game at the University of Nebraska, which drew the largest crowd ever for a women's sporting event.\\xa0It's clear that superstars such as tennis phenomenon Coco Gauff, gymnast extraordinaire Simone Biles, and basketball powerhouse A'ja Wilson are not just excelling—they're elevating the profile of their respective sports. But perhaps the most electrifying moment this year was the women's basketball Final Four. It featured a showdown between Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese—athletes who are rewriting the narrative for women’s basketball. Although I had to watch it through VPN free Chrome, I don't regret anything. Their face-off attracted legions of new fans, proving that when it comes to thrilling sports moments, those featuring women athletes are not to be underestimated. The evidence is clear: people are eager to watch women's sports; they've always been ready.\\xa0#5 Head coach gets the halftime zoomies\\xa0In a notable Week 2 performance, running back Raheem Mostert delivered an impressive stat line of 18 carries for 121 yards and two touchdowns against the New England Patriots. However, despite Mostert's exceptional performance on the field, the media focus shifted away from the player's achievements.\\xa0The spotlight was instead captured by Head Coach Mike McDaniel's unique reaction post halftime interview, where he was seen making a swift exit from the camera's gaze. McDaniel has been the subject of various internet memes throughout the season, and this particular incident was no exception, garnering significant attention in the lead-up to Halloween.\\xa0Conclusion\\xa0Naturally, the purpose of the article was not to retell everything related to the last sports season. These are simply the memes and notable events that come to mind when we talk about the 2023-2024 season.

It surely feels like the stars are aligning.Xabi Alonso is still a beginner as a head coach at a professional level. He favours positional football which should work well for the current crop of players at Liverpool. His preferred formation at Bayer, however, is three at the back, which means some adjustments would need to be made.How Liverpool can line up with Xabi Alonso as Liverpool head coach: 2 optionsAnother concern is his squad management. At Bayer, Alonso has a strongly preferred starting lineup and rotates it reluctantly. It may have to do with a less intense calendar or poor bench options, but this is something he'll have to change if he returns to Liverpool.According to our bookmaker partners MEGAPARI, he is still the likeliest candidate to replace Klopp — and Bayer won't stop him from leaving if he wants it.Roberto De ZerbiThe Brighton boss is also very much in the frame for the job, as confirmed by The Times' Paul Joyce.In many respects, De Zerbi is similar to Alonso: he also wants his team to play with the ball at their feet. However, he has more experience, having successfully worked with Sassuolo in Italy and Shakhtar in Ukraine before coming over to Brighton.He has shown impressive tactical flexibility, setting up his team with three or four players at the back. The defensive structure may have been Brighton's weakest link under De Zerbi, but he never had a player like Virgil van Dijk there.Negotiating with Brighton is usually hard — but Liverpool have a recent positive experience that got them Alexis Mac Allister for a bargain fee.Julian NagelsmannThe German FA still dreams of Jurgen Klopp and will most likely try to talk him out of taking a year out. If they succeed, Julian Nagelsmann will officially be available after only signing a short-term deal last year.Aged 36, Nagelsmann is the youngest among the potential candidates — but he might also be the most experienced. He took Hoffenheim to the Champions League, led RB Leipzig to new heights and won the Bundesliga with Bayern. The circumstances of his sacking from the last club should have no negative impact on his prospects elsewhere — although his reported lack of engagement with players could be concerning.Pep LijndersLiverpool have already announced that Klopp's assistant manager is set to leave in the summer as well as he plans to start his own managerial career. Still, plans can change, especially since no other potential candidate knows this team as well as Lijnders does.The Dutchman is liked by the players and has had a big say on the team's tactical set-up in the last few years, so the transition would be smooth.The biggest question mark is over his ability to be the main man in the room. He already had a go at managing with NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch second tier in 2018. He was sacked after four months and returned to Liverpool. How much has he grown since then?Steven GerrardA couple of years ago, Gerrard seemed to be on track to be the next Liverpool manager. After a miracle win with Rangers in the Scottish Premiership, he started well with Aston Villa where he was contracted until the same summer when Klopp's agreement was supposed to run out.The wheels came off in less than a year. Gerrard was sacked from Villa in October 2022 and could only get a job in Saud Arabia a year later. He has already signed a new contract with Al Ettifaq despite them being in mid-table.As a result, our bookmaker partners MEGAPARI only give it odds of 12 happening. In fairness, Stevie's chances are probably even lower.Ange PostecoglouDespite being already 58 years old, Postecoglou is a new name in the Premier League, but in just half a year, he has reinvigorated Tottenham with a brave tactical approach.Spurs play in a 4-3-3 formation with an extremely high defensive line which is very familiar to Liverpool fans. Unlike the Reds, though, they have both full-backs inverting in possession which is even riskier than what Klopp has done with Trent Alexander-Arnold. Perhaps just as important, Postecoglou has been vocal about supporting Liverpool as a kid, so a chance to take over at Anfield would surely be enticing for him.Unfortunately, Tottenham are highly unlikely to allow their manager to join another 'big six' club, especially since he has just started building a team in North London.Who do you want to see in charge of Liverpool next season?

Furthermore, in all competitions, they have won four of their last five games, including Preston North End 4-0 in the third round of the FA Cup.\\xa0The Blues have won the FA Cup on eight separate occasions; however, they have only triumphed over a lower-tier Preston squad thus far and are already up against a top-tier EPL side in the fourth round.

WhatsApp messages, emails and voice recordings exchanged between Eto'o and a former Fecafoot executive have been provided as evidence accusing the ex-footballer of abuse of power, match-fixing, threats and inciting violence. The evidence has already been sent to FIFA’s Ethics Committee in a comprehensive petition as far back as July 2023 by former vice-president Fecafoot Henry Njalla Quan Junior and some other members of the Cameroon FA. The matter is also being investigated by CAF, Africa's football governing body. Njalla Quan Junior claims Eto'o fixed a match between his team Njalla Quan Sports Academy and Kumba City FC. Eto'o allegedly made a phone call to the referees at halftime during the game after which two dubious penalties were awarded and five red cards were shown to the opposition team. After the evidence was sent to FIFA, an associate of Eto'o reportedly texted Quan Junior with a threatening message. The message reads, “I am a mafia of this revolution and in this specific mafia we do not betray our leaders. I have protected the interest of our mission till date. However, if you f**k with me be ready to carry the load of the circumstances.”A 19-page letter sent to FIFA also accuses Eto'o of corruption since he became president of Cameroon's football association. The letter signed by nine members of Fecafoot also accuses FIFA of not treating the matter quickly enough. They cited the case of Spanish FA boss Luis Rubiales who was handed a 90-day suspension within weeks of being accused of sexual harassment for kissing Barca icon Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup final in September.

So a third coming of The Special One remains possible until he gets a new job.We've decided to imagine how Chelsea would look like under the Portuguese with their current squad.We've included Nkunku in the XIs as the severity of his injury remains unknown but omitted long-term absences such as James and Fofana.Option 1: 4-2-3-1Almost everyone uses this formation these days, including Poch. But guess who made it popular in England? You’re right — Jose Mourinho in his first Chelsea spell!This will likely see Caicedo dropped to the bench. Enzo adds much-needed creativity while Gallagher is ‘the only player who would have survived in Jose’s first Chelsea team’ — he could be Mourinho’s modern-day John Obi Mikel.Jose would also put an end to Poch's experiment of playing Colwill at left-back; Levi would compete with Badiashile for the starting spot at left centre-back.Up front, Mourinho needs a classic target man and the closest to this profile is Broja (sidenote: prepare for a Lukaku return next season). The question is who'll play on the wings but we'll go with the conservative option of Sterling and Nkunku, although if Mudryk is as hard-working as he likes to show off on Instagram he might get a nod.Option 2: 3-5-2Mourinho is not the biggest fan of this formation but at Roma, he's shown that he can adapt his ideas to the players available and it meant using the three-at-the-back shape.Chelsea have a lot of centre-backs and excellent wing-backs, so returning to the Tuchel-era 3-5-2 could be possible if Jose is back at the Bridge.We see Mourinho picking Caicedo over Enzo for this one to add solidity to the midfield, with Nkunku and Broja up front — and Jackson and Sterling getting benched.Note that Chalobah will return to the squad.

The 61-year-old tactician left Roma amidst a challenging spell, with the team sitting ninth in Serie A.

Let's take a look at our Champions League Last 16 Power Rankings and the betting odds for the first leg ties!1. Manchester City The Citizens have always been tipped as Champions League favourites but this time Lady Luck is really smiling at them: Pep Guardiola's side have been drawn against arguably the weakest last-16 team, Copenhagen. Fans see a win as a must and even a draw will be considered a massive disappointment.Odds: 1.33 (Bet365)CLICK HERE TO BET ON MAN CITY VS COPENHAGEN WITH A BONUS!2. Bayern MunichThe Bundesliga giants are surprisingly not the first in the league table but they are firmly in the race, trailing leaders Bayer Leverkusen by just two points. Thomas Tuchel's side were shockingly eliminated from the German Cup by Saarbrucken but they can still win the double.Bayern's new striker, Harry Kane is on fire with 27 goals and eight assists in 26 games across all competitions. The Englishman is thirsty for trophies after ten years at Tottenham.Odds: 1.57 (Bet365)3. Paris Saint-GermainPSG finished second in the Group of Death that also featured Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan and Newcastle. Traditionally, the Parisians are dominating Ligue 1 and perform relatively poorly in the Champions League. However, the fact that they were drawn against minnows Real Sociedad makes them the favourites for the Round of 16 and boosts their position in the rankings.Odds: 1.7 (Betway)4. Arsenal It's been a while since the Gunners made noise in Europe. The last time Arsenal featured in the Champions League was in the 2016-17 season. There is still hope for Mikel Arteta's side in the Premier League where they sit third behind Man City (2nd) and Liverpool (1st) but the league leaders look ridiculously strong and Man City have a game in hand.Perhaps, focusing on the Champions League is worth considering.Odds: 1.87 (William Hill)5. Inter MilanInter Milan were the runners-up in the Champions League last season. This time, they are facing Atletico Madrid in the Round of 16, and that means Inter's former star Diego Simeone will return to San Siro.The Nerazzurri look confident in defence having replaced Andre Onana with Yann Sommer, and their attackers Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram have scored a combined 32 goals this season. And they are hungry for more. Odds: 2.0 (BWin)6. Real Madrid Real Madrid may have ups and downs but going to the Round of 8 is something their fans see as a must but this time it might be a tougher task.With long-term injuries to Eder Militao and Thibaut Courtois, Madrid's defence is now more vulnerable and RB Leipzig could capitalise on that. However, with Vinicius, Rodrygo, Joselu and Jude Bellingham up front, Los Blancos are still firm favourites to qualify for the next stage.Odds: 2.2 (BWin)7. PSV EindhovenOn Matchday 1, PSV were thrashed 0-4 by Arsenal. After three games, they had two points in the bag and almost zero hope. However, they bounced back and ended the group stage as runners-up to Arsenal.In the Eredivisie, PSV are head and shoulders above everyone else - 12 points separate them from second-placed Feyenoord. That means head coach Peter Bosz can rest some of his key players in the league games and come out all guns blazing against Dortmund.Odds: 2.25 (Stake)8. BarcelonaThe team is unbalanced and losing 3-5 on home soil, the head coach has announced his exit... For Barcelona opponents, it's arguably the best time to play against the Catalans.Robert Lewandowski's dip in form and Gavi's injury add to the long list of Barca's problems and it's really hard to predict how their two-leg clash with Napoli would pan out.Odds: 2.6 (N1Bet)CLICK HERE TO BET ON BARCELONA VS NAPOLI WITH A BONUS!9. Napoli Napoli's home form this season has been nothing short of atrocious, and their 9th place in the Serie A table isn't the worst possible result, to be honest. The Parthenopei sacked head coach Luciano Spalletti who won them the domestic league and shockingly replaced him with Rudi Garcia who now is also gone. With Walter Mazzarri in the dugout, Napoli's spirits seem to have lifted a bit but would that be enough to qualify against struggling Barcelona?Odds: 2.85 (Ivibet)10. Borussia DortmundEveryone was writing Dortmund off but they sensationally topped their group. Considering BVB lost their biggest star, Jude Bellingham, in the summer, it is even more surprising.While Edin Terzic seems to have coped with the Englishman's exit, the only problem that can really spoil Dortmund's party is lack of depth in the squad.Odds: 3.2 (SkyBet)11. RB LeipzigRB Leipzig proved they can do wonders when they were leading 2-0 against Man City in the group. Pep Guardiola's side gave them a reality check in the second half but no one should underestimate the German outfit.Real Madrid will be wary of that but the likes of Xavi Simons, Dani Olmo and Benjamin Sesko (and of course, head coach Marco Rose) will be up for the challenge.Odds: 3.25 (Betclic)12. Atletico MadridCan Diego Simeone finally win the Champions League? Atleti's display in the group against Feyenoord, Lazio and Celtic suggests so. The Rojiblancos were undefeated at the group stage. More importantly, they scored 17 goals in six games: that's the second-best result among the last 16 teams.Odds: 4.0 (Megapari)13. PortoPorto regularly qualify for the UCL knockouts but this time it was especially tough: the game against Shakhtar Donetsk could have gone either way but the Portuguese side managed to secure second spot in Group H, level on points with Barcelona.Being drawn against Arsenal may be not the easiest match-up but with Sérgio Conceição as the head coach and the likes of Pepe, Evanilson, Ganelo and Mehdi Taremi on the pitch they will be looking to get to the Round of 8.Odds: 4.37 (Pari Match)14. Real Sociedad Real Sociedad came undefeated in UCL Group D, and it was already an achievement for Imanol Alguacil's side. It has been a decade since La Real featured in the Champions League, and the last time they qualified for the knockout stage was in 2004. PSG looks a good match-up to make history.Odds: 5.15 (GGBet)15.

And then, in a surprising pivot, the club decided to call the whole thing off. This decision came amidst a climate where the intertwined worlds of sport and digital currency are both fraught with fervent debates and rocketing interest.\\xa0What initially sparked Chelsea's interest in a crypto casino deal?Chelsea Football Club, one of England's top soccer teams, has decided against a deal with online gambling company Stake for a new front-of-shirt sponsorship, as reported by The Telegraph.Previously, it was widely reported in the UK media that Chelsea was nearing an agreement with Stake for a one-year sponsorship deal. This deal was expected to be on par financially with Chelsea's former agreement with the company Three, reportedly around £40 million (approximately $50.8 million) annually.Nevertheless, Chelsea has chosen to end these discussions and is currently exploring other potential partnerships.Why the change in direction?This change in direction follows criticism from Chelsea supporters regarding the Stake sponsorship. A survey by the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) revealed that 77% of participants were opposed to the Stake deal. The CST criticized the deal, saying it would undermine the efforts of the Chelsea Foundation in conducting workshops on gambling harm awareness in schools in West London.The CST acknowledged Chelsea's need to increase its revenue but stressed that it should not compromise the club's values.For Stake, this partnership would have been their second major shirt sponsorship in the Premier League, following a deal with Everton for the 2022/23 season, believed to be worth around £10 million ($12.7 million) annually.Chelsea's decision to halt the Stake deal has not been officially explained, but it is a move that will likely please both the club's fans and anti-gambling campaigners.The search for a new sponsorThe club, now searching for a new shirt sponsor, has faced several challenges in this pursuit. Proposals from Allianz and Paramount were reportedly turned down, the latter due to the Premier League's concerns about disturbing relationships with TV partners.As Chelsea, under the majority ownership of Clearlake Capital, aims to double its revenue, securing a sponsorship deal comparable to or exceeding the previous The Three contract is crucial, especially considering the club's £600 million ($763 million) investment in players last season and the need to adhere to financial fair play (FFP) regulations.Contrary to some rumors, Oman Air will not be Chelsea's main sponsor for the 2023/24 season, despite recent speculation fueled by images of a company representative with Chelsea's new head coach Mauricio Pochettino.The resistance to the Stake deal is part of a wider backlash against betting sponsorships in the Premier League. For instance, Aston Villa's recent agreement with BK8 was criticized by fans, though the club did not end the partnership.This trend comes as Premier League clubs have agreed to phase out betting sponsorships on the front of matchday shirts by the end of the 2025/26 season.Conclusion: The bold decision of Chelsea as a signpostChelsea's choice to not proceed with a crypto casino sponsorship speaks volumes in an era where every move a club makes is under the microscope. The decision has ripple effects, not just across football but in the realms of online gambling and digital currency, too. It's a reminder that in the fast-paced world of sports and even faster-moving sector of cryptocurrency, sometimes the best play is the one that's not made. As the landscapes evolve, only time will tell if such collaborations will become the norm or remain an 'almost happened' footnote in the grand narrative of sports sponsorships., 2024-01-30T04:18:44.000Z, nan\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-02-12-3-positives-from-barcas-disappointing-33-draw-v-granada/, Kingsley_, 3 positives from Barca's disappointing 3-3 draw v Granada, Barcelona were disappointing again on Sunday as they lost precious points in the title following a 3-3 draw to Granada at home. Granada played well on the night but Barca were architects of their own downfall as horrendous defending had Xavi punching his seat in fury. However, there are many positives Barca can take from such a game. Let's focus on three. Lamine Yamal is HIMThere's hardly any more debate. Lamine Yamal is everything Barca have been seeking since the departure of Lionel Messi — a talented young forward bursting through La Masia with the physicality and confidence to take the game by the scruff of the neck and make things happen. Yamal was named Man of the Match in this game and it's easy to say Barca could've lost if the 16-year-old didn't show up with two goals. Barca fans can look at Lamine and dream about the future of their club. That was indeed a stunning performance from a player who has been incredible all season. It's now five goals and as many assists for Lamine this season. Raise your hand if you know another 16-year-old doing the same in Europe. Bring it down. They're mostly still in school.Barca have a new no. 6Xavi has unearthed a weapon that could help Barca until the end of the season by using Andreas Christensen as number 6. The Danish centre-back was brilliant again in his makeshift position.Christensen allowed Gundogan and De Jong to express themselves in midfieldChristensen only lost possession twice in the 67 minutes he spent on the pitch. He was never dribbled past and completed 35 of 36 passes – a staggering 97% pass accuracy. That Xavi levels when he was playing. One could hardly tell if Christensen was a seasoned midfielder or a defender playing the role for only the second time in his Barca career. Lewandowski's brilliant 2024 continuesA striker has done at least 80% of his job when he scores a goal during the game. That's what Lewandowski has been doing more frequently in 2024 and Granada was no different. Although the Polish striker missed one big chance in the game, he didn't underperform his 1.02 xG (expected goals) as he managed to register his name on the scoresheet. What's more, Lewa has now scored six times for Barca in 2024, including scoring in successive La Liga games. Barca can rest easy with their top striker now contributing goals more regularly for the team., 2024-02-12T11:40:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-05-4-calf-problems-in-18-months-zinchenkos-injury-problems-analysed/, Toby Prince, 4 calf problems in 18 months: Zinchenko\\'s injury issues analysed, Alex Zinchenko\\'s fitness issues have become a major concern for Arsenal.

When Real Madrid trained on Wednesday ahead of their game against Girona this weekend, they did so without any fit centre-back. Carlo Ancelotti had to do without Nacho who pulled off after complaining of muscle overload. Antonio Rudiger also missed the session as he's still struggling with the blow he suffered at Getafe. With Real Madrid unable to count on David Alaba and Eder Militao for some considerable period, it leaves the team in limbo going into the business end of the season. For the Girona game, there's a real possibility that Ancelotti will have to set up his team without a natural centre-back in defence. Starting Tchoumeni at centre-back makes sense considering he's played there before. Carvajal is too small to partner with Tchouameni as Real Madrid could get bullied with aerial balls. Also, Camavinga would help Los Blancos more as the defensive midfielder. That leaves Ferland Mendy as the best bet at left-center-back considering how defensively solid he is.

And the final - in a gigantic stadium in the USA, FIFA has announced where and when the first and last games of the 2026 World Cup will take place.This is quite a reason to admire the arenas in Mexico and the USA.The World Cup kicks off on June 11th at the legendary Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, which has a capacity of more than 83,000 spectators.The World Cup finals were held there twice: in 1970 and 1986. First, the Brazilians won thanks to a goal by Pelé, then the Argentines won when thanks to Maradona's incredible performance.Only two stadiums in the world have hosted two finals, with the Maracana being one of them - but the 2026 World Cup in Mexico will only host the early stages of the competition, with all crucial games taking place in America.An interesting detail: Azteca doesn't look particularly big from the outside because the pitch is nine meters below street level. During construction, care was taken to ensure that the sun shone vertically across the lawn so that the teams always played under the same conditions.The final of the tournament will take place on July 19th at MetLife Stadium in New York. The NFL teams New York Giants and New York Jets play there.The stadium was built in 2010 for $1.6 billion - at the time it was the most expensive in the world. The arena's capacity is 82,566 people.The stadium has an atypical sponsorship history. The German insurance company Allianz wanted to acquire the naming rights during construction - it offered between 20 and 30 million dollars. But this news angered New York's Jewish community because of the Alliance's ties to the leadership of Nazi Germany during World War II. The deal was therefore never completed.In the summer of 2011, another insurance company MetLife purchased the rights.

Against Aston Villa this Sunday though, Man United scored their first goal via an almost perfect set-piece. Bruno Fernandes' shot from the corner found Harry Maguire, whose headed effort found Rasmus Hojlund. The striker made no mistake in smashing it in. This also makes it Hojlund's fifth goal in his last five games for Man United after struggling to score at the beginning of the season. Usually, Man United fail to pass the ball to the right player who can take the shot. In this case, Maguire not only won the header but also found the right man in Hojlund.

That's exactly what's happening at Barcelona today. There are at least five players at Barca whose performances this season are why Xavi isn't sitting too comfortably in his managerial seat. Let's talk. Ronald AraujoIt's high time we say it, Ronald Araujo is nowhere near the player he was last season. We can take the game against Real Madrid as an example, Araujo looked bizarre as Vini Jr. gave him the run around to score a first-half hat-trick. The big defender gave away a penalty and was clumsy in defending before finally getting himself sent off, despite being captain at the time. Even if we scrap the distasteful Clasico, Araujo has only helped Barca keep 6 clean sheets in his 19 other appearances this season. That should worry Xavi. Jules KoundeIt's looking like playing Kounde at centre-back is a risk Xavi should stop taking. We've watched the Frenchman make error after after error leading to goals against Barca from that position. What should worry Xavi is that teams are beginning to exploit his tardiness and clumsiness. That was the case against Girona, Almeria, Las Palmas and recently against Real Madrid. Kounde's problem might be overconfidence or a sheer lack of it. However, the player does reasonably well when playing at right-back. Maybe Xavi should try him there more often, or even permanently. Alejandro BaldeIf Balde doesn't improve quickly, Barca might have to pull out their checkbook and sign a proven left-back. They need to. This season has seen the unmasking of Balde by Barca's opponents. They now know there's a gap he'll leave behind on the left when he makes his attacking forays and forgets to track back. They simply exploit it to hurt Barca. Balde recently turned 20 which a barely an excuse for his lack of defensive awareness. But in that regard, Xavi and his staff must coach him closely. However, there's no legislating for Balde's lack of output in the final third. Xavi doesn't clip his wings and pays dearly for that sacrifice. Still, the player produces precious little at the other end of the pitch. Just the one assist in 25 games for an attack-minded fullback is not good enough. Not at Barca and certainly not at any top club. Ferran TorresThere's a strong argument that Ferran Torres performs better as an impact sub than as a starter. I support that notion too – but not after watching him start Barca's last three games. If Xavi continues to start Ferran at the expense of better wingers like Joao Felix, the outcome could be disastrous particularly when you watch how much Barca struggles to break down opponents when he starts. In El Clasico, Ferran was spotted fuming at Vinicius, who was taunting the Barca after scoring a hat-trick. One can say it was more from the frustration of watching a player do remarkably well while playing in the same position as him. Barca fans would prefer he channels that anger to perform on the pitch when he plays. Pedri**Pedri is Pedri and I wouldn't have his name here if not for injury. But let's face it. Pedri is not delivering the good Barca desperately needs at the moment. Many in Blaugrana will argue that Pedri has the same talent if not more than Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, but the gap between them statistically is miles apart and we know why. Pedri is not scoring goals or making assists. He scored in the early days of the season and claimed an assist as Barca beat Porto but that's been it in 13 games. That's scarcely good enough for a player who Xavi heavily relies on. Frenkie De Jong recovered from injury and has been putting up Man of the Match performances since. 33-year-old Ilkay Gundogan has 10 goal involvements already, seven of which are assists. It tells you Pedri needs to step up and be counted, or his ever-trusting manager will be in hot water over his poor form., 2024-01-16T13:45:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-05-from-matthew-mcconaughey-to-robbie-williams-the-new-superstar-trend-is-football-investmen/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, From Matthew McConaughey to Robbie Williams: The new superstar trend is football investment, Forget flashy sports cars and expensive handbags: the new must-have celebrity accessory is a football team.British singer Robbie Williams wants to continue this trend with FC Port Vale .

The growth decree as it was known gave Italian teams the opportunity to offer far larger wages to football players than they could previously afford. However, now the advantage is gone and it will have a huge influence on the future of Italian football. On January 1, 2024, the Italian government declined to extend the growth degree. Let's discuss the meaning of the 'growth decree'. Tifo Football used Roberto De Zerbi's example to explain it. Signing De Zerbi to one of Italy's clubs would be difficult: leaving aside the buyout clause in his Brighton contract, there would be a Premier League salary to match too. The growth decree was introduced to reverse the brain drain caused by talented Italians leaving the country.A tax break helped to entice back the likes of De Zerbi, also making Italy more attractive to skilled foreigners. Anyone in the 48% bracket willing to domicile in Italy, would pay around half of that on their income instead and that is a significant advantage. However, due to changes in politics, the law was repealed. The tax break was one of the few edges that Serie A clubs had in recruitment. Roma, for example, may not have been able to appoint Jose Mourinho in 2021 without a growth decree. The same with Lukaku and his big salaries.  Paring down the growth decree will also make it harder for Premier League clubs to sell into Italy. Abraham, Tomori, Loftus-Cheek and Pulisic transfers to Serie A clubs won't be that easy without this law.  Maintaining the gap between Serie A and Premier League will only become more challenging after losing this edge. The growth decree also influenced such positive things as the competitiveness of Italy clubs in the football arena, attracting brands, social media followers and tourists. However soon it all could change. Despite all the issues the removal of this law creates, there are some advantages too. The clubs won't that encouraged to buy players from abroad, so they will be pressured to develop their young talents.

But it is not the similarities in the playing style of these two players but rather a potentially high price for which Barco could be sold to his next club after showing his skill in Brighton. Seagulls are known for developing young players and then selling them for big prices to the top clubs.19-year-old Valentin is considered to be one of the brightest Argentine prospects. Naturally, he is a left-back but can also play on the left side of the midfield diamond.   Looking at Barco's heatmap of his season for Boca Juniors, you can see that he mostly operates on the left side of the field. However, you can often see him appearing in the middle or even on the right side.                                        FourFourTwo analysed Barco's playing style in their YouTube video. Here are some strengths of the Argentine: creativity, good technique, take-on ability and confidence. Weaknesses: He is not that quick and strong yet.According to FBref stats, Barco is better than other fullbacks of the Argentine football league in most aspects. The take-on stat is especially incredible. He is better than 99% of fullbacks in take-ons attempted and successful take-ons. However, it is not just fullbacks. He is also great compared to midfielders. Barco has an incredible reading of the game: finding space, predicting the game and good timing of his progressive passes. All these qualities are necessary for a world-class midfielder.You can watch some of his skills here. Even with all his abilities, Barco's weaknesses can be a reason for Brighton to send him on the loan.

Are City approaching this with the same tactics they used when UEFA charged them?\"\"They have the deepest pockets of all and can pay the best lawyers for however long it takes. If you’re innocent, why the need to drag things out and keep kicking that can? Surely it’s in City’s interests to resolve this?\"\"I really hope we find the club are not guilty. We have seen some of the most beautiful football from them in recent years. It would be terrible to see a stain on that achievement.\"\"If they are convicted, it would tarnish our Premier League unimaginably. It is simply too big an issue to let anyone drag it out.

With 10 goals and 11 assists after 30 games. You'd think he's a forward, but Grimaldo is only a left full-back who's showing himself to be one of the best in that at the age of 27. Grimaldo has become a massive attacking weapon for Leverkusen thanks to how Xabi Alonso uses him — a fullback with the licence to join the attack and create an overload. He also starts in midfield or on the wings occasionally, just like Joao Cancelo. FBref graph shows Grimaldo is among the top 1% of fullbacks for most attacking statistics — goals, shots, assists, chances created, you name itGrimaldo was bred in Barca's La Masia before leaving for Benfica after being starved of first-team opportunities. Barcelona could've re-signed for free last summer when his contract at Benfica ended but Deco was focusing on other targets like Inigo Martinez, for instance. Plus Barca might've calculated they already had Marcos Alonso and Cancelo.

Some have multiple players for this. Even the teams that are known as ‘nice’ or ‘soft’ will have one or more of these players. And even with the evolution of football and changes in playing style, these destructive players have continued to play their trade on the pitch. Wherever this player plays, this is a player that loves doing the dirty work, running the hard yards, putting the tackles in, but above all, collects yellow cards like they were going out of fashion.\\xa0\\xa0Distinguished Company\\xa0In the past, we have had the likes of Dunga, Gennaro Gattuso, Edgar Davids, Gilberto Silva, and Jean Tigana, all performing this role to distinction, whether for club or country. The likes of Partick Vieira and Didier Deschamps led their nation to World Cup glory doing their bit for the team. Some are more subtle than others. Claude Makelele, known as one of the best defensive midfielders to grace that position, was one of the more silent operators. The Frenchman, who never won anything with France, could smell danger from the other end of the pitch and had the innate ability to be in the right place at the right time to win the ball back for his team.\\xa0\\xa0But while Makelele was a more silent assassin, there were certainly some players that liked their presence to be known on the pitch, which usually ended up with their names going into the referee’s notebooks. It was not only midfielders of course who would perform this role. The above-mentioned protagonists were esteemed operators in the centre of the pitch, but you did not or do not have to be a midfielder to be able to stick your foot in.\\xa0The All-Time Greats\\xa0We have chosen the worst yellow card offenders in the annals of each of the major five European leagues: English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and French Ligue 1. You probably know the names of a few of them off the top of your head, but you might forget about one or two. The regular card collectors are as follows:\\xa0\\xa0Gareth Barry (122 yellow cards in 653 Premier League appearances – one every five matches)\\xa0The left-footed Englishman, who was capped 53 times by his country, leads the way by some distance for yellow cards picked up in Premier League history. Barry was an all-action midfielder who featured for Aston Villa, Manchester City, Everton, and West Bromwich Albion during a sparkling career. Barry also cements this role at the top of the discipline charts with 6 red cards in his career, level with Joey Barton, Luis Boa Morte, and Nicky Butt in this bad boy club. Detention slips would also have been handed out to Wayne Rooney (102), Lee Bowyer (99, and was infamously sent off one time for fighting his own Newcastle United teammate Kieron Dyer), and Kevin Davies (99), but none of these players got close to dethroning Gareth Barry.\\xa0Sergio Ramos (174 yellow cards in 525 La Liga appearances - one every three matches)\\xa0Sergio Ramos, one of the two players on our list who is still playing, has epitomised Real Madrid for a considerable amount of time—16 years, to be exact. He achieved this while playing as the tough-tackling, no-nonsense defender he still is, winning four Champions League trophies, five La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys, four Supercopa de Espanas, three UEFA Super Cups, and four FIFA Club World Cups. Ramos thrives on pressure situations and has received five of his nine career red cards against Madrid's bitter rivals Barcelona. Additionally, Ramos still has time to get more cards after coming back to his first professional team: Sevilla FC.\\xa0Stefan Effenberg (111 yellow cards in 370 Bundesliga appearances – one every three matches)\\xa0Effenberg was most known for his two spells with FC Bayern Munich, where he won 3 Bundesliga titles and also captained the team to Champions League success in 2001. The midfielder was known as The Tiger, due to his fiery attitude and tenacious style of football. Effenberg was a leader on the pitch and characterised his leadership with a mixture of doggedness and style. The German possessed a passing range envied by many and was very much the complete midfielder, in the tackle and out of it.\\xa0Luca Rigoni (101 yellow cards in 303 Serie A appearances – one every three matches)\\xa0Luca Rigoni is probably the name that would have escaped many if this question featured in a pub quiz. Judging by the yellow card statistics in his time playing Serie A football, Rigoni seemed quite calculated in this side of the game and averaged a yellow card in exactly one in every three matches. The Italian played for a host of Italian clubs but spent most of his Serie A playing days with Chievo Verona. During the 2013/14 season, Rigoni picked up an astonishing 15 yellow cards in just 33 appearances, which ultimately helped Chievo escape relegation. All for a good cause.\\xa0\\xa0Marco Verratti (92 yellow cards in 276 Ligue 1 appearances – one every three matches)\\xa0As the other player in our roundup that is still playing football, it is quite remarkable that Marco Verratti has accumulated the number of yellow cards he has at the age of 30. With many years ahead of him, Verratti has plenty of opportunity to add to that tally. Since moving to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2012, Verratti has been a constant in the PSG midfield and is never afraid to get stuck in.\\xa0\\xa0Nowadays, the enforcers on the pitch need to be more wary in how they stop the opposition. The introduction of VAR means that players cannot get away with some of the underhand tricks from the past. Over the decades, the ways of picking up yellow cards have also evolved. Yellow cards for time wasting for example means that even the more innocent of players is at risk. But regardless of whether you are a Rodri, Joshua Kimmich, Declan Rice or Casemiro, the role of the enforcer will still need to be played by someone., 2024-01-31T09:20:04.000Z, nan\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-15-bayern-munich-sets-unwanted-champions-league-record-after-lazio-defeat/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, Bayern Munich sets unwanted Champions League record after Lazio defeat, Bayern Munich faced a disappointing night in the Champions League against Lazio, making unwanted history in the process.

Here's how we rated the players.Bradley: 10/10. A yet another immense performance, provided two lovely assists, for Darwin for the second goal and for Gravenberch for the fifth. Should have had another assist in the middle of the first half but Gakpo failed to score. Was a huge threat going forward and quite solid at the back. He's becoming more than a deputy for Trent, he's becoming a competition. Moved to the right-forward position after Trent came on and did well there too. Showed his work rate, sprinting like crazy late in the game despite playing for the entirety of the game.Jones: 9. Is CuJo Liverpool's most in-form player at the moment? Ran that midfield, scored the opener, connected the defence and the attack, broke the lines with his passing, confused the opposition defenders with his movement. What a player.McConnell: 9. Provided an excellent assist for Jones for the opener with a Trent-esque pass. Great passing in general, also good defensive instincts to close the passing lanes for the opposition.Gomez: 8. Getting closer and closer to scoring each time he plays, nearly broke the deadlock today with an excellent effort from range. Plays on the left as if it was his natural position, composed at the back and dangerous going forward.Jota: 8. Clinical when it mattered, also could have had an assist but Gakpo couldn't score from his pass.Darwin: 7.5. An emphatic finish to give Liverpool the lead. Hit the post earlier, what a goal that would have been.Van Dijk: 7.5. Bullet header to score the Reds' fourth goal.Diaz: 7. Made Gravenberch's goal possible with an insane touch in the build-up.Szoboszlai: 7. Celebrated his return from an injury with an excellent corner assist to Van Dijk.Gravenberch: 6. Poor defending against Gibson for Norwich's equaliser. Nice link-up with Gakpo and Jota on a few occasions but was the weakest link in the Reds' midfield today. Scored his first Liverpool goal in added time.Alisson: 6. Should have saved the Canaries' second goal.Gakpo: 4. Wasted a huge chance early on, another in the middle of the first half and another shortly after the break. Left his scoring boots at home.Others: Konate, Trent, Quansah 7; Robertson 6.5Liverpool\\xa0–\\xa0Norwich City\\xa05:2 (2:1, 3:1)28 gennaio, 14:30, AnfieldStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesLiverpool:\\xa0Becker,\\xa0Gomez\\xa0(Robertson\\xa055),\\xa0Quansah,\\xa0Konaté\\xa0(van Dijk\\xa055),\\xa0Bradley,\\xa0Jones\\xa0(Szoboszlai\\xa055),\\xa0McConnell\\xa0(Diaz\\xa079),\\xa0Gravenberch,\\xa0Gakpo,\\xa0Nunez\\xa0(Alexander-Arnold\\xa066),\\xa0JotaNorwich City:\\xa0Long,\\xa0McCallum\\xa0(Giannoulis\\xa083),\\xa0Gibson,\\xa0Hanley\\xa0(Sørensen\\xa062),\\xa0Stacey,\\xa0Hernández\\xa0(Sainz\\xa061),\\xa0Gomes Sara,\\xa0Mclean,\\xa0Nuñez Espinoza,\\xa0Fassnacht\\xa0(Gibbs\\xa084),\\xa0Barnes\\xa0(Idah\\xa062)Goals:\\xa01:0 - 16 \\xa0Jones\\xa0(McConnell),\\xa01:1 - 22 \\xa0Gibson\\xa0(Gomes Sara),\\xa02:1 - 28 \\xa0Nunez\\xa0(Bradley),\\xa03:1 - 53 \\xa0Jota,\\xa04:1 - 63 \\xa0van Dijk\\xa0(Szoboszlai),\\xa04:2 - 69 \\xa0Sainz,\\xa05:2 - 90+5 \\xa0Gravenberch\\xa0(Bradley)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARIPARIPESATIPICO888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers, 2024-01-28T16:47:26.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-05-jurgen-klopp-we-can-admit-arsenal-deserve-the-three-points/, Georgy Tzepkovsky, Jurgen Klopp: \\'We can admit Arsenal deserve the three points\\', Speaking to Sky Sports on Sunday night, Jurgen Klopp said: \"In general we can admit that Arsenal deserve the three points.\"The circumstances were a bit strange.

According to The Athletic, Erik ten Hag has changed his approach in training and he's also working on a more open relationship with his players. The report claims Ten Hag and his team are now training players to replicate successful movements in training during games as well. Doing so seems to be working as Man United look like a better-drilled unit than they ever have before. The Athletic further adds that Ten Hag has also held one-on-one sessions with players like Rasmus Hojlund to resolve their issues.

Here is what Chelsea could look like under the ex-Bayern Munich gaffer.Tactical style and strengthsHansi Flick’s philosophy revolves around dominating possession and a high press style where he urges his players to keep pressing the opponent, far into their own half. The German gaffer loves control, with his Bayern side averaging 60.2% average possession in the 2020-21 season, his final one at the club. This is more than the 58.8%Chelsea have managed under Poch this season.However, Flick is not just about passing the ball around for the sake of it but actually getting things done in the final third. He drills his team to often try to create chances by crossing the ball from the wide areas or deep position to feed the centre-forward.The German manager likes to deploy a 4-2-3-1 formation, something which the current Chelsea side is well equipped for. Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo are slowly creating a solid partnership in midfield, while Conor Gallagher excels in that advanced role.Flick is an expert at unleashing the ultimate potential in his side’s attacking force. His Bayern Munich scored a whopping 260 goals in 86 games and only failed to score in one single match in his reign. A centre forward is the one who profits the most from Flick's system: Robert Lewandowski scored 83 goals in 71 appearances under Flick.WeaknessWith that being said, the major downside of Flick’s system is the defending. He prefers to play a high defensive line, which draws his high defensive line into bad positions. His system exposes the backline to counter-attacks and Bayern often conceded goals \\xa0— one goal conceded per game on average, to be precise. There are a few ways that Chelsea can potentially line-up if Flick becomes the next manager. Here we’ll look at one lineup consisting of the current squad of players and another involving some possible new signings.Lineup 1As Flick tends to play in a 4-2-3-1 shape, he’ll probably think of playing all three of Enzo, Gallagher and Caicedo. The Englishman can probably play in that no.10 role and Cole Palmer is best suited on the right, while Christopher Nkunku’s best position is on the left. At the back, because of their passing qualities, Axel Disasi and Levi Colwill should be the go-to centre-back partnership.Lineup 2But as happens with any new manager, Flick will also obviously want some more signings if he was to take over at Chelsea. The biggest problem that needs to be fixed is up-front, where Chelsea are being strongly linked to Napoli forward Victor Osimhen. Seeing how Flick’s system benefits the centre-forward, Osimhen can really thrive under him in the centre-forward role.Flick is also likely to demand a new centre-back signing to add some more composure and leadership qualities in that area. Matthijs de Ligt is reportedly ready to leave Bayern in the summer and he can be brought in to be played alongside Disasi. Another Bayern player whom the German gaffer could ask for is midfielder Joshua Kimmich, who is also rumoured to move in the summer. The German midfielder can play in the defensive-midfield role instead of Caicedo and give Enzo more freedom to create and score goals.❓Would you like to see Hansi Flick managing Chelsea next season?

Playing up-front, Nkunku caused trouble with his movement and hold-up play. Took a few touches to score a brilliant goal and then should’ve had a penalty later on. One can only hope he can constantly keep starting games going forward.Enzo Fernandez – 7Fernandez looked like the only one who was willing to put his body on the line to win duels and dodge the Liverpool press in midfield. Went past the players with some nice flicks, recorded an 82% passing accuracy (68 passes completed) and worked hard defensively with two blocks and five possession recoveries.Carney Chukwuemeka – 7Chukwuemeka added the drive that Chelsea needed after coming on. Made some darting forward runs and forced the opposition players to go back. Assisted Nkunku with a nice pass and showed determination to get the ball forward.Noni Madueke – 4Madueke made under 10 passes and couldn’t create a single chance. Troubled by Andy Robertson and often lost the ball in bad areas. Taken off at half-time.Thiago Silva – 3Thiago Silva looked his age in this chaotic game and couldn’t hold together Chelsea’s midfield shape at all. Caught in bad positions in almost every single Liverpool goal and couldn’t be the defensive commander that the younger players needed him to be.Benoit Badiashile – 3Badiashile actually started the game strongly and saved Chilwell from trouble, but he lost his composure under the intensity. Made to look like a fool for multiple goals, allowing Jota to go through him and Silva for his and being outjumped by Diaz for his goal.Ben Chilwell – 2The Chelsea captain played anything but like one with John Terry looking on from the stands. Chilwell attracted pressure as Liverpool kept creating chances through his side.

His four-year stint at Barcelona brought Cules hundreds of great memories to cherish, here is one of them.His last bowPep Guardiola said goodbye to his home on May 5, 2012. On that day, Barcelona hosted Espanyol. His soon-to-be exit wasn\\'t a secret: on April 27, Pep publicly announced he would leave the team at the end of the 2011/12 season.\"Four years is an eternity,\" he explained in a press conference. \"In December I communicated to the president that I felt my stage here was ending. However, I couldn\\'t make it public or tell the players [earlier].\"In these four years I have become worn out. I have given everything and I need to recharge. Because of the high demand, I have to move away and recover.\"The Barcelona Derby was a perfect match-up for Pep\\'s last home game. Barcelona already secured the 2nd place in La Liga, so there was no pressure on the manager and the team. And Espanyol were a bottom-half team that seemed an easy nut to crack.Giant tifoFans\\' love for Pep has always been immense. No wonder Cules prepared a special farewell for the boss. A giant tifo with \"T\\'estimem Pep!\" (in Catalan: \"We love you, Pep!\") on it appeared at the home stand of Camp Nou. There were, of course, smaller posters and banners that channelled the same message.4 record-breaking goals by MessiLike other Barcelona players, Lionel Messi learned about Pep\\'s exit from the April presser. He was shocked:\"I want to thank Pep with all my heart for how much he has given me,\" Messi said as cited by Marca. \"I preferred not to be present at the press conference because the media would have sought the faces of the players\\' grief, and that is something I didn\\'t want to demonstrate.\"Messi became a world-class star under Pep and he thanked the boss in the best possible fashion. In the 4-0 win, the Argentinean scored all four goals: one from a direct free-kick, two more from the spot and one after an assist from Adriano.With those four goals, Lionel Messi broke Gerd Muller\\'s record of goals scored in a single season (67) - he ended the season with a total of 73 strikes.Guard of honour for PepAfter the final whistle sealed the 4-0 win for the hosts, the Blaugrana players joined Pep for a dance around the centre circle. Then the team and the backroom staff formed a guard of honour for Guardiola.The entire Camp Nou rose to bid farewell to the legendary coach, the opposition fans not being an exception.Pep\\'s final wordsAddressing the crowd, the departing manager said: \"Life has given me this gift, in these five years we have been able to enjoy the best spectacle. I\\'m not too different from you. I have been a privileged spectator, same as all of you, just a bit closer to these fantastic players. \"You don\\'t know how much I value being so loved during this time, feeling so loved and so valued during the display today, at all times, during four or five years, day-to-day. You don\\'t know how happy I feel.\"Thanks to everyone, especially the ones closest to me who worked hard so that you could have a good time watching us play football. And to the others who haven\\'t been as close, well, I have felt very close. Know that I will miss you all. \"The one who loses is me. I leave you in the best of hands. Know that I leave you with the best players. The belt was squeezing me and I took it off. But you keep it on, because this continues. You\\'ll do well. I wish you the best, and good luck. See you soon, because you\\'ll never lose me!\"After those words, the players tossed Guardiola in the air.Pep was in charge of two more Barcelona\\'s games leading the Catalans to an away La Liga draw with Real Betis and the Copa del Rey triumph against Athletic.After that, he stepped off and kept his promise taking a one-year sabbatical before accepting an offer from Bayern Munich., 2024-01-18T15:29:55.000Z, Tribuna\\n', \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-12-scott-mctominay-tops-saka-haaland-and-salah-in-key-performance-metric/, Georgy Tzepkovsky, Scott McTominay tops Saka, Haaland and Salah in key performance metric, Scott McTominay came off the bench late in the second half to score the winning goal against Aston Villa on Sunday.The 27-year-old midfielder continues to be Manchester United's leading goalscorer in the Premier League with seven goals.In fact, McTominay's goal have won the Red Devils 12 points in the top flight so far this season — the most out of every player.Even though there are those who have scored more goals for their clubs, McTominay's seven goals have earned Man United the most points.Will McTominay now be used only as a super-sub?

Lunin answers, RB Leipzig had a controversial decision go against them in Tuesday\\'s Champions League clash. The referee disallowed a seemingly perfect goal as they dominated Real Madrid in a game that ended 0-1.Two minutes in and the controversy sent fans into a fury in Leipzig. A corner kick in favour of the home team flew very close and Lunin cleared it with his fists.The ball landed on the edge of the area, where Schlager hit it back over the defence which became a perfect assist for Sesko, who headed the ball into the open net.Initially, it looked as though Benjamin Sesko was offside, but the replay showed that Rodrygo kept him in a legal position. So the fans were rightly quizzical when referee Irfan Peljto blew for what was signalled as offside.At the moment Schlager’s volley was sent in, Henrichs, in an offside position, blocked Lunin from behind, meaning that he interfered with play from an ilegal position and, as it ended in a goal, it was disallowed.“He was putting me off, I think you can interpret it as a foul. I don’t know,\" Andrey Lunin said. \"After I punched it, the player shot from the edge of the box.\"Then I took a couple of steps forward because I didn’t have time to get back in position and I stayed high so I could react if the ball came back in.

Jose Mourinho ended Man United's trophy drought after Sir Alex Ferguson retired, winning the Europa League in 2017. He made an impact as the club's manager until the infamous third-season syndrome struck Mourinho. He was sacked in December 2018 but he's now being primed for a return. If he does somehow return in a Sir Jim Ratcliffe-led era, Tribuna.com takes a look at some players who may receive the boot. Luke ShawShaw had his fair share of troubles with Mourinho, who never believed in the defender's abilities. The duo even had a public fall-out after the former boss made some body-shaming comments following Luke's weight gain. Shaw was close to quitting Man United but stayed on once Jose left. Since then, he's established himself at club and international level. Despite that, it's likely their past issues have not been resolved entirely. Marcus RashfordAlthough Rashford had just burst onto the scene as an Academy gem, he still had his issues with Mourinho. Marcus has admitted to facing a 'tough' time under the Portuguese boss. And now, with all of his disciplinary issues, it's tough to see Mourinho tolerating any of it. With just four goals to his name all season so far, Rashford's future is highly uncertain regardless of whether Jose takes over. AntonyAntony got his first goal of the season against Newport County, having endured a miserable time in 2023/24 so far. With all of his tricks and flicks, Antony often has little to show for in terms of producing numbers. A certain Paul Pogba faced a similar situation under Jose - he arrived for a record fee and then played what was branded 'YouTube football'. That's essentially the kind of football that gets views on YouTube compilations. Antony is kind of similar and has a flaring temper to go. That won't sit well with Mourinho. Andre OnanaFor a manager who likes to park the bus, it's essential to have a solid goalkeeper. Jose had David De Gea the last time around but now, Onana faces the daunting task of filling the Spaniard's boots. Onana has fallen out twice with the Cameroon Football Federation due to lack of game time and alleged disrespect. He also struggles to keep clean sheets, meaning he won't fit Mourinho's requirements. Victor LindelofMourinho has famously remarked that Lindelof lacks aerial awareness. Few could argue that the Swedish defender has overstayed his welcome at Man United. Moreover, Mourinho would now have the services of Raphael Varane, whom he handed his debut at Real Madrid. The duo face quite the reunion, which potentially spells trouble for Lindelof. Anthony MartialMartial struggled under Jose then and there is absolutely no doubt he will face a similar situation once again. The Frenchman has scored just twice all season and has drastically deteriorated - if that's even possible. Injuries and lack of form have led to inconsistency over the years, maybe to the point of no return. Regardless of whether or not Jose comes back, Martial is likely to leave as a free agent once his contract runs out this summer. Aaron Wan-BissakaJose will be reunited with another favourite, Diogo Dalot, whom he hailed as the 'best defender' in his age group when he signed him for Man United. Since then, Dalot struggled only under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer; he's fit himself into the plans of all other managers almost like a chameleon. Dalot has improved massively in all aspects of the game, even adding a goal or two over the years. There's no doubt he will be Jose's preferred choice at right-back., 2024-01-31T20:35:00.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-16-jose-mourinhos-barca-xi-if-hed-been-appointed-in-2008-no-place-for-xavi/, Kosta König, Jose Mourinho's Barca XI if he'd been appointed in 2008 — no place for Xavi, Jose Mourinho has been dismissed as the Roma head coach.Years ago, he could've ended up as a Barca boss instead of Pep Guardiola.

With that being said, let’s try to make logic of this situation and show a few ways Chelsea could line up with De Jong.Option 1: With Enzo and CaicedoA lot of questions have been raised on how De Jong can co-exist in a midfield like with Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Well, it is possible. The three can play in a trio, with the Dutchman best suited in the deeper ‘no.6’ role. That means his addition can allow Fernandez and Caicedo to operate as two ‘no.8s’ – with the latter able to play as that energetic ball-winner and the Argentine able to create more chances in a free role.Option 2: In a three-man defenceWith Mauricio Pochettino reportedly thinking of shifting to a three-man backline for Chelsea, De Jong’s versatility means that he can actually play in a centre-back role in such a defensive shape. He has done so for Barcelona and the Netherlands, being able to move the ball around efficiently and also hold his own against strikers.

Наличие на поле игрока с лидерскими качествами и способного влиять на игру, считается большим преимуществом для команды. В декабре 2023 года составлен список топ-50 самых влиятельных футболистов всех времен. Градации по рейтингу нет. Всех просто расставили в алфавитном порядке. Но мы в этой статье выделим некоторых игроков, которые попали в список.Криштиану Роналду\\xa0Безусловно, без португальца этот список был бы неполным. Криштиану Роналду внес большой вклад в историю футбола:- 5-кратный победитель Лиги чемпионов;- 5-кратный обладатель Золотого мяча;- Чемпион Европы в составе сборной;- 3-кратный чемпион АПЛ;- 2-кратный чемпион Ла Лиги и Серии А.Это далеко неполный список достижений португальца. Криштиану остается лучшим бомбардиром в истории футбола и продолжает забивать. 2023 год игрок завершил в качестве сильнейшего голеадора, забив 54 мяча, чем доказывает, что на спортивную пенсию ему еще рано. Букмекерская контора Париматч принимает прогнозы даже на индивидуальную результативность игрока в матчах.Лионель МессиМесси в 2023 году получил восьмой Золотой мяч. Этот рекорд способен продержаться вечно. На пару с Роналду Месси был доминирующим игроком в европейском футболе больше десятилетия. Даже отправившись на закате карьеры в МЛС, игрок продолжает выигрывать титулы и поражать фанатов спорта техникой и мастерством. К тому же, Месси выиграл в футболе все возможные титулы, как на национальном, так на клубном уровне, включая Клубный чемпионат мира.Влияние футболиста на команду можно увидеть наглядно. Месси перебрался в последнюю команду в турнирной таблице и стал обладателем Кубка лиг, выиграв с коллективом все матчи. А вот в первой же игре без аргентинца команда проиграла.

That\\'s what I\\'ve done and I\\'m proud. \"My dream was to coach Barcelona, \\u200b\\u200bplay good football and win. And it has been achieved. Not this season, but I leave with a very clear conscience,\" Xavi said. Last season Xavi led Barcelona to the league title and Super Cup with the expectation being they could do even better this term. However, Barca lost their defence of the Super Cup earlier this month and were also knocked out of the Copa Del Rey days later. Barca could still retain their La Liga title but that\\'s a tall order considering they\\'re 10 points behind Real Madrid in the title race.

Fast forward to today, and she\\'s set to face off against football legends like Arsenal\\'s Jen Beattie and former Barcelona star Asisat Oshoala for a rising NWSL side Bay FC. What makes this even more remarkable is the eye-popping $860,000 (£685,000) transfer fee attached to her move.This transfer fee surpasses the record set by Keira Walsh in 2022, when Barcelona paid £400,000 for the then-Manchester City star. Kundananji not only becomes the most expensive women\\'s football player in history but also the first African player, male or female, to break a world transfer record.The 23-year-old\\'s journey to the top has been nothing short of prodigious. Her remarkable performances in Madrid over the last 18 months and her pivotal role in Zambia\\'s historic Women\\'s World Cup showing have paved the way for this groundbreaking move. With an impressive record of 33 goals in 43 Liga F games, Kundananji has earned praise for her raw speed and goal-scoring prowess. Notably, she has also honed her tactical awareness and physicality, making her a more consistent threat on the field.

However, there are already several players known to be on Chelsea's shortlist.Victor Osimhen and Ivan Toney are known well to a regular Premier League fan, while Viktor Gyokeres is more of a dark horse. Finally, Evan Ferguson is another Brighton player linked with Chelsea barely after breaking through to the first team.Here, we're trying to compare Chelsea's potential signings.Victor OsimhenThe 25-year-old became an elite goalscorer last season, finding the net 26 times to help Napoli to their first Serie A title since 1990. This season, his record is more modest, seven goals in 13 league games.Availability could be a concern, as well as his lack of defensive contribution. Still, if Chelsea want a goal-getter, it's hard to find anyone better.Ivan ToneyAged 27, the Brentford star is older than other Chelsea targets and not an ideal fit for the club's new transfer strategy. However, he is a 20-goal scorer in the Premier League with virtually no weak spots — except his gambling problems.Prior to his ban, Toney has not missed a single game with an injury which should be especially impressive for Chelsea fans.Viktor GyokeresThe Swedish forward is actually six months older than Osimhen, but he has only exploded this season. After joining Sporting Lisbon, he has scored 13 goals and provided seven assists in 20 league games — a stellar form, even if we take the league level into account. Like Toney, Gyokeres has virtually no injury history. In the previous two seasons with Coventry City, he featured in 91 out of 92 Championship games and was an unused sub in the only other match.Evan FergusonThe Irishman is yet to turn 20 years old and has played just 50 games for Brighton, so he's a definition of a raw product.Still, he's already found the net 12 times in the Premier League and outperforms other Chelsea targets in defensive stats.

Xavi's case is almost the exact opposite. In his press conference following Barca's disastrous 5-3 defeat at home to Villarreal, Xavi shocked everyone by announcing he would be leaving at the end of the campaign. It was a decision that left a sour taste in the mouth of Cules considering how wobbly Barca have been all season. However, we can imagine Xavi won't be the only one leaving the club at the end of the season. Here are six players expected to leave in his wake. 1. Marcos AlonsoThe Spanish left-back has missed the majority of the season with an injury we can't tell when and how he picked it up. Even before the injury, Alonso was often being left as an unused substitute.Alonso might've found some game time following Balde's hamstring problem but that's not the case. One wonders when Alonso did anything special since he arrived at Barca two seasons ago.The 33-year-old is out of contract in the summer and it's unlikely that Barca renews it. 2. Sergi RobertoRoberto is Barca's captain but he barely leads by example on the pitch. The midfielder cuts across as a player whose best years are behind him. It must be stated that Roberto isn't a bad player. Some even consider him a Barca legend but he's nowhere near Barca's best starting XI even in an underperforming team. Also, Fermin Lopez is ahead of him for impact subs. Like Alonso, Roberto will be a free agent in the summer of 2024 and without Xavi to plead his course his exit is all but sealed. 3. Oriol RomeuBarca were desperate for a defensive midfielder in the summer and decided to pitch their tent with Oriol Romeu. That decision is hard to understand now. Romeu hardly plays regularly and barely impresses when he does feature. The Spaniard would look over at his former team, Girona, and wonder if he'd have emerged as La Liga Champion had he chosen to stay. Reports say a Turkish team is interested in signing him but that may only happen in the summer when the massive clearout begins. 4. Joao CanceloCancelo is only on loan at Barca but there's a hefty transfer fee on his head if Barca intends to make it permanent. The Portuguese fullback has also shown traces of inconsistency despite starting his Barca career like a house on fire. His penchant for overlapping has often cost his team painfully. Without Xavi, a new manager might look at Cancelo and say he's not the type of right-back he wants at Barca. Added to Barca's financial difficulty, it makes Cancelo's continued stay at the club ever so complicated. 5. Ferran TorresFerran Torres joined Barca after receiving a call from Xavi explaining the project and how he intends to use him. Since then, Ferran has been a regular player regardless of all the criticism he faced. The Spanish forward has sometimes repaid his manager's faith like his recent hat-trick against Betis while also underperforming in many others.With Xavi leaving, Ferran might struggle to play regularly under a new manager if his consistency doesn't improve. That would force Barca to cut their losses and sell him. 6. Robert LewandowskiRobert Lewandowski was wanted by numerous clubs across Europe when he felt his time at Bayern Munich was up. Chelsea and PSG pushed the hardest to get him but he chose Barca after Xavi called to convince him. Xavi still keeps faith in the Polish striker despite the fact he's no longer delivering as well as he did last season. With Xavi leaving and Vitor Roque banging on the door of the first team, Lewandowski's time at Barca could end quicker than stipulated in his contract. The big striker is 35 and already achieved everything he set out to achieve in club football. He could decide to follow Xavi out the door and stretch his legs in the Miami sun like Messi and Suarez.

The team performance over the entirety of the game wasn't too good but the Blues go home with a dramatic victory. Here is how we rated the players.Gusto: 8/10. Another time the young right-back can hold his head high despite a poor team display. Really, really good runs, dribbles, crosses and passes. Excellent assist for Gallagher's first goal. Was the best player on the pitch before getting subbed off — he left everything on the pitch.Gallagher: 8. Came in clutch today. Scored an equaliser for Chelsea, getting in the right place to connect to Gusto's cross. And when it looked as if Chelsea were getting only a draw, scored the winning goal in a Lampard-esque fashion.Palmer: 7.5. Anonymous for 90 minutes, woke up in added time and grabbed two assists. Put everything into that run for Chelsea's second goal. Thiago Silva: 7.5. Maybe a bit slow in possession but very solid and reliable at the back. Subbed off after rolling his ankle blocking a dangerous Mateta shot. Great comeback after so much negativity was dumped on him last week.Petrovic: 7. Made a couple of excellent stops. The Lerma goal was unsaveable but Djordje did his best today.Chilwell: 6.5. Was among the liveliest players in a languid Chelsea side in the first half. His runs weren't too useful but at least he put in some effort. Disappeared somewhat after the interval though.Enzo: 6.5. Scored a late goal in style to seal the win for Chelsea. His midfield performance was very questionable though, could have moved the ball forward in a more meaningful way.Sterling: 6.5. Had a good chance to score shortly after coming on but took too many touches and bottled it. Got to give him credit — and a good rating — for an excellent play leading to Gallagher's second goal.Nkunku: 6.5. It's not that he did anything special today yet the team is playing better when Christo is on the pitch.Gilchrist: 6. A decent outing for the youngster after coming on to replace the exhausted Gusto at right-back. Nearly caused a Palace goal at 1-1 when he failed to clear the ball properly.Disasi: 5. A couple of nice blocks but struggled overall. Jackson: 2. One tasty backheel aside, the Senegalese was a ghost wandering the Selhurst Park pitch tonight.Caicedo: 2. Made some really good tackles to win possession for Chelsea. It wasn't enough though as the Ecuadorian's erratic passing is a huge worry. Palace thrived on getting the ball from him. Partly at fault for Lerma's goal.Madueke: 1. Lost the ball leading to Palace's opening goal and absolutely useless going forward.

Let’s examine this in more detail.\\xa0Money Simply Talks\\xa0\\xa0The biggest advantage is an obvious one – all Saudi teams are affluent with money, so it is inevitable that some players’ heads are turned.\\xa0\\xa0As is the case when every year ends, sports journalists are busy coming up with a list of the highest-paid footballers, and one could not help but notice that Saudi players dominate there!\\xa0However, teams in Europe also must take a big portion of the blame. Everyone seems quick to diminish and criticize the Saudis for their spending, but European clubs happily do business with them, which seems duplicitous, to say the least.\\xa0\\xa0Just take a look at the transfer sums that were spent in the summer of 2023, and you will know why we criticize teams as well.\\xa0Of course, the quality of the Saudi league has risen, which has also attracted more spectators, and more bettors as well! If you think you know all about the Saudi league and want to try out your luck with a couple of wagers, then take a look at our list of reliable bookmakers to do so!\\xa0The Reasons Against\\xa0Well, money is a big driving force behind every decision a person makes – regardless of their occupation. Nonetheless, money is not guaranteed to bring you success. The Saudis will have a big impact on transfer dealings in the coming years, but we believe they will fail to overpower Europe because of three main reasons.\\xa0European Clubs Have Money\\xa0Well, the Europeans are not short of money themselves! Just a mention of the likes of PSG, Man City, Real Madrid, etc. should be enough for potential transfer targets to know that they are about to get a serious bump in their paychecks.\\xa0Some argue that the transfer market has not been the same since Neymar’s record-breaking move to PSG from Barcelona- a move that has raised more questions than answers in terms of his impact in Paris. Since then, more than 15 transfer deals have surpassed the $100 million mark, so there is enough money flowing around!\\xa0Pride and Ambition\\xa0Not everyone in football cares only about money. There are countless examples of players making their decisions based on pride and ambition. They care about their legacy and they know that if they are to be engraved in football’s folklore, they have to make a name for themselves in Europe.\\xa0That is the reason why the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane rejected moves to Saudi Arabia during the summer.\\xa0Players Past Their Prime\\xa0Lastly, we have the most obvious disadvantage of the Saudi League. Sure, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Neymar are on jaw-dropping contracts, but we are talking about players who are simply past their prime.\\xa0None of the so-called big hitters has joined the league at the peak of his powers. Although he won’t admit it, Cristiano Ronaldo’s decline has been obvious in the past few years, while both Neymar and Sadio Mane have left their respective clubs after underwhelming seasons.\\xa0Let’s not even get started on Jordan Henderson, Fabihno, Edouard Mendy, and Kalidou Koulibaly – all of whom seem to have their best years behind them after disappointing seasons at Liverpool and Chelsea.\\xa0\\xa0Verdict – Legacy is Hard to Buy\\xa0All in all, we can say that we cannot turn a blind eye to all developments occurring in Saudi Arabia at the moment. Players get astronomical offers, and sometimes, it is hard to reject them.\\xa0\\xa0However, as we have seen with the latest U-turn involving Jordan Henderson, who swiftly came back to Europe after failing to adapt in Saudi Arabia, the grass is not greener there.\\xa0Saudi Arabia has a big job on its hands – build a legacy that will match the one of European clubs. Until it does so, we cannot see the Saudi Pro League being a threat to Europe!, 2024-01-28T06:05:24.000Z, nan\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-04-havertz-was-diego-costa-for-us-today-arsenal-fans-react-to-kai-havertzs-performance-in-li/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, \\'Havertz was Diego Costa for us today\\': Arsenal fans react to Kai Havertz\\'s performance in Liverpool clash, Arsenal defeated Liverpool 3-1 in a very important match.

There is no way something this large will not make an impact on global culture, even taking a trip from the real world into the virtual world of gaming.\\xa0\\xa0This is not a new development, as soccer games were among the first developed for home computers during the 1980s. This long-term transition from physical to digital entertainment has not only caught on with soccer fans who want to play the games but also gamers who have developed a love for the sport via the game.\\xa0\\xa0The evolution of video soccer games\\xa0While many of the early soccer-themed games available were more based on soccer management than the action on the field due to graphical restraints, it didn't stay that way for long. Franchises like FIFA and PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) had real gameplay and have become staples in the gaming industry, with the yearly release of the latest iteration of FIFA regularly topping the charts. The success of these games was partly due to the official licensing, which allowed gamers to become their favorite players and play for their favorite teams. As these titles were joined by others, they made improvements that advanced the gameplay, so it became more realistic rather than just having a pure arcade feel.\\xa0eSports and online multiplayer soccer games\\xa0Of course, this took soccer's influence on gaming to new heights. Online options for new soccer games allowed players from around the world to compete against each other, mirroring the same competitive spirit found in the real-world game. Something this popular was bound to grow even further, and before long, online tournaments and leagues formed, which again took the same shape as their real-world counterparts.\\xa0\\xa0The comparison does not end there, as the huge viewing audiences for the real-world version of soccer are being caught up in some areas by those logging into stream coverage of eSports fixtures. These competitions have professional players as well who can also win prestigious prizes even if the salaries haven't quite caught up yet.\\xa0\\xa0Soccer slots and casino games\\xa0\\xa0It's not just eSports where soccer has made its mark on online games; casinos have their share of soccer-related fare as well. If you want to play online pokies in New Zealand somewhere like Jackpot City, then you can get your teeth into the Football Star slot, which also has a deluxe version for enhanced play. It will have all of the smooth graphics and immersive gameplay you would expect from a top casino, as does the card game Match Day or versions of Blackjack or Roulette, where a digital Vinnie Jones is the dealer.\\xa0\\xa0A few final thoughts\\xa0A global phenomenon like soccer is bound to leak into the digital world and online gaming in all forms has done the sport proud. Console games have bred the same leagues and tournaments that exist in the real world, and even casino players have slots and table games that incorporate the world's most popular game., 2024-02-12T14:37:22.000Z, nan\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-30-robbo-back-in-xi-how-should-liverpool-line-up-v-chelsea/, Aleksei Blokhin, Robbo back in XI?

De Zerbi has come a long way since helping Shakhtar Donetsk win the Ukrainian Super Cup, becoming the first Italian manager to do so.Fast-forward a few years into his job at Brighton and De Zerbi has successfully transformed them from mid-table scrappers to a highly-entertaining unit. Brighton qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the first time under him and are still going strong despite having to sell major stars like Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo in the summer.If Chelsea were to replace Mauricio Pochettino anytime soon, De Zerbi could be the go-to option because he’s proven in the Premier League and has a distinct, successful philosophy that can get the Blues back to the top.How Does De Zerbi Like His Team Playing Football?Brighton have adapted a possession-heavy style of football under De Zerbi, who likes his players to keep the ball and infuriate their opponents with their swift, efficient passing. The Seagulls have maintained a 3-4-2-1 formation under the gaffer this season, and have boasted 64% average ball possession per game in the Premier League – only behind Man City (66%) in that regard.De Zerbi prefers for his team to play the ball from out of the back, building out from the backline and finding spaces and exploitations in the opponents’ shape to create chances. The Seagulls have created 48 big chances this season, and the Italian side have averaged 11.98 shots per game in the Premier League too.What is most important is that Brighton are clinical in finishing off their chances. They have averaged 1.8 goals per game in the Premier League this season and have scored 42 goals in 23 matches, the sixth-best goal record in the Premier League.Biggest weakness in De Zerbi’s approachThe most prominent issue for Brighton this season has been their defence. De Zerbi likes to play a high defensive line that is often tormented on the transitions and results in poor errors leading to goals. This season itself, seven errors from Brighton’s backline has resulted in goals.The Seagulls also tend to suffer when playing against physical teams who play a low block and willingly surrender possession. Brighton have only kept two clean sheets in 23 league games this season and average 1.65 goals conceded per game.With that being said, De Zerbi’s wonders with Brighton are an indication that he could succeed in getting the best out of this young Chelsea squad and get the club back to competing for major trophies again. \\xa0His attractive brand of football, tactical prowess and lively nature can help bring back that spark into the club.If Todd Boehly & co can make it happen, here we will look at two favoured formations of De Zerbi which can be implemented at Chelsea.Lineup 1: With current squadFortunately for the Blues, they already have a couple of ex-Brighton players who excelled under De Zerbi before moving to London. This includes Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Robert Sanchez and Levi Colwill – who all had prolific stints at Brighton in the past.These three are almost locked in to be major players under a Chelsea side possibly managed by the Italian. Because of the formation, Enzo Fernandez can play in a no.8 role with Caicedo in the middle. In the frontline, it’s likely that De Zerbi prefers Christopher Nkunku to lead the line and have Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling behind them to provide that attacking burst and creative spark too.Sanchez, Fofana, Disasi, Colwill, James, Enzo, Caicedo, Cucurella, Palmer, Sterling, NkunkuLineup 2: With potential new signingsIf he takes over Chelsea, De Zerbi will obviously want a few more signings to add more quality to his starting XI. He is likely to demand a new natural centre-forward who can spearhead the attack and add a lot of goals. With the Blues recently being rumoured to be interested in signing Evan Ferguson, that can happen if Boehly & co rope in De Zerbi.Along with that, De Zerbi is also likely to demand the signing of a new centre-back to command his backline. Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt is reportedly open to leaving the club this summer and the Blues could make a move for the quality centre-back, who is excellent in distributing the ball and a sound defender and leader.Going by these potential signings, here is how De Zerbi’s Chelsea could potentially look like.Sanchez, Disasi, De Ligt, Colwill, James, Enzo, Caicedo, Cucurella, Palmer, Nkunku, Ferguson❓Would you like to see Roberto de Zerbi managing Chelsea next season?

While the tournament wouldn’t include any European giants (except for Real Madrid and Barcelona) in the early days, the general feeling is that they would eventually agree on joining the project which promises to be way more beneficial for the participating clubs than the existing Champions League.What if the major competition kicked off right now? We’ve emulated the first three seasons through Football Manager 2024 and got some mindblowing results that changed the history of football forever.Fasten your seat belts, we’re getting ready for the takeoff.Season 1Manchester City became the first and only side to win the Super League right after claiming the UEFA Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain finished second while Barcelona completed the top three.The main Super League founders, Real Madrid, only finished seventh and decided to bring back Rafa Benitez to replace Carlo Ancelotti who only knows how to win UEFA tournaments.‘Surprise surprise’Bayern replaced Thomas Tuchel with… Diego Simeone despite staying up in the top division.Almost all the participating Serie A clubs, Inter Milan aside, proved incapable of competing in the Super League. Juventus were so frustrated about it they went for SEAN DYCHE straight afterwards!Erik ten Hag was succeeded by… Quique Setien at the end of the season.‘These cows are now mine’Here are some of the biggest player moves that took place in the first season:Victor Osimhen from Napoli to Chelsea (€71m)Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid to Man City (€26.5m)Rafael Leao from Milan to Tottenham (€70m)Dayot Upamecano from Bayern to Inter Milan (€65m)Theo Hernandez from Milan to Bayern (€61m)Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli to… Real Sociedad (€55m)Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen to Man City (€40m)Leandro Trossard from Arsenal to Barcelona (€40m)Lamine Yamal from Barcelona to River Plate (loan)The number of Man City players in the first Team of the Year is staggering. Bernardo Silva (11 goals, 7 assists) won the Player of the Year while Pep Guardiola was expectedly named the Manager of the Year.Season 2It’s season two and you may spot some surprising new names here: Spurs, Villa, but also Al Hilal with Neymar (now it’s just the Global Super League) and Boca Juniors.Still, the Citizens look unstoppable, but look how high Inter Milan and Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea are! Trust-the-process has worked after all?Tottenham look quite hopeless, but wanna know who their manager is?Alright, maybe Saudi clubs actually aren’t that bad after all?Here are some big moves two seasons into the Super League:Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus to Real Madrid (€80m)Serge Gnabry from Bayern to Real Madrid (€57m)Heung Min Son from Tottenham to Real Madrid (stop them please, €42m)Wojciech Szczesny from Juventus to Chelsea (€16.5m)Just a few changes to the Team of the Year which is still dominated by City.This time we see Mo Salah and Kevin De Bruyne here. The Egyptian would actually win two Ballon d’Ors in a row before something absolutely wild happens to him… we’ll reveal it at the end of the piece.Season 3This is where the real madness begins.First of all, Arsenal win it.Secondly, this is the season when Leo Messi is back in European football. You’d never guess who he decided to join…MANCHESTER UNITED! He actually reunited with Quique Setien in one of the weirdest scenarios ever –\\xa0even for Football Manager. Although he got just three goal contributions in 16 Super League matches, Old Trafford was the place he hung his boots at… what does Cristiano think of it?Cristiano apparently didn’t care much. He was too happy about playing in the Super League where he scored more goals than Leo (three against two) despite dropping back to the second tier (that’s when he retired, obviously).Mysteriously, they both scored in their final encounter against each other. What a beautiful ‘last dance’.Some important movements happen in the managerial merry-go-round at the end of the season:Jurgen Klopp takes over at PSG after some well-deserved restMikel Arteta leaves Arsenal to give way to Zinedine ZidaneQuique Setien says bye to United as Luis Enrique comes inOne thing that left us absolutely stunned is that both Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk decided to join Arsenal before retiring.Nah, it’s barely possible to imagine Liverpool without these two, isn’t it? However, while Virgil van Dijk seems to go nowhere, the Egyptian might very well leave Liverpool at the end of this season alongside Jurgen Klopp.Salah is nearing the final year of his contract. It’s quite likely that if Liverpool don’t cash in on him this year, they will have to let him go for free in the summer of 2025.As of now, Salah’s most likely destination in real life is believed to be Saudi Arabia: our betting partners Megapari rate this move at 2.62 which means a 38.2% probability.The best XI is so different now… and look, all of these Arsenal players are currently part of Mikel Arteta’s squad. They’ve finally shifted City from the throne and did it in style, with Bukayo Saka winning the Ballon d’Or.Dreamers keep on dreaming you say? In reality, Arsenal could make their first step to dethrone Man City already this season - they are going toe-to-toe with the Citizens in the Premier League title race. Besides, in the Champions League, they are rated as one of the top-5 favourites to lift the trophy.

Can't believe he's just 20 years old.Elliott: 7. Looked determined to score to shush the home crowd which was booing him. It didn't happen but a positive performance from Harv anyway, made things happen in the midfield. Excellent pressing as well. Looked gassed after 70 minutes.Mac Allister: 7. His performance didn't really catch an eye but Liverpool lost control of the game when he came off. The Argentine was really crucial in keeping possession and breaking down Fulham's attacks.Gravenberch: 7. Moved the ball forward really well, made a lot of interceptions. Really should have scored late in the first half after a breathtaking Elliott cross. Still, put in a very decent shift.Kelleher: 6. Made several nice stops today but failed to claim a cross early in the first half, leading to Fulham's best chance of the game. The post spared his blushes. Doesn't give you the composure that Alisson gives.Darwin: 6. Failed to score but not really his fault: for some reason, Leno turns into a beast when Nunez takes a shot. Probably his biggest mistake today was not spotting Diaz's run and playing Elliott instead of Lucho on the break early in the second half.Van Dijk: 6. Could have done better when Fulham equalised, he simply let Diop run past him.Bradley: 5.5. Very decent going forward, even if he could have done better with the accuracy of his crosses sometimes. However, needs to work on his defending. Willian often got the better of him in the first half and Conor is chiefly at fault for Fulham's equaliser as he bought into a Wilson trick.

Gavi could be the key player of his project as the one who covers plenty of space and wins lots of duels every time.As always, Pedri would complement him well in a more creative role.Right winger: Mohamed SalahMo's current deal with Liverpool is up in 2025 and it's unclear yet where the Egyptian King will end up afterwards despite the recent Saudi links.Taking Salah to Barcelona means Klopp would get Blaugrana the first ready-made superstar since Leo Messi. Even if in the short term, this would be a boost on all levels.Left winger: Luis DiazThe Colombian's father has revealed his son's dream of becoming a Barca player one day – Klopp's arrival would be the best time to fulfill it.Sometimes it feels Diaz's spark is what Blaugrana need on the left wing: pacy, skillful, with an ability to win duels against any defender, Luis can be really crucial to this team.Striker: Lamine YamalIt's not necessary to be an incredibly-prolific striker to play under Jurgen Klopp.Like Roberto Firmino, the youngster would play an important role in the buildup and focus on improving chemistry with the other forwards, forming an unstoppable frontline trio.Barca XI: Ter Stegen; Cancelo, Araujo, Kounde, Balde; Gavi, Douglas Luiz, Pedri; Salah, Yamal, Diaz., 2024-01-26T19:28:05.000Z, Tribuna.com\\n\", 's://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-02-14-more-than-i-originally-thought-riyad-mahrezs-wife-taylor-ward-reveals-what-saudi-arabia-i/, Andrii Sokolovskyi, \\'More than I originally thought\\': Riyad Mahrez\\'s wife Taylor Ward reveals what Saudi Arabia is really like, Riyad Mahrez made an unexpected move to the Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli from Manchester City last summer.

I was just like \\'I\\'m so happy they\\'ve got Nando\\'s\\'.\"\"The vibe is just very different.

You can\\'t compare it to the UK - it\\'s nothing like here. I\\'m enjoying it so far, it just feels like I\\'m on holiday, I don\\'t feel like I\\'ve moved there yet.\"Families of players joining Saudi clubs often worry about the gender segregation rules in the Gulf State. In the past, Mail Sport reported an incident where the wife of a player, who had joined a Saudi club, was hissed at in a shopping center for wearing shorts.Despite these concerns, Ward reassured that the rules are starting to become more relaxed.\"I think it depends on where you go. At the moment they\\'re looking at relaxing these rules. From what I had heard, I was worried about that stuff when we first went, but it\\'s surprised me. It\\'s more relaxed from what I was first told.\"\"I\\'m not just saying this, I actually really like it. I can\\'t fault it so far, we\\'ve really enjoyed it.

According to Diario Sport, Barcelona's president Joan Laporta is planning a clearout sale in the summer to raise €200m. The better part of that money will be used to sign Rafa Leao. To raise money for the signing of Leao, Barca could be open to selling players like Jules Kounde, Frenkie De Jong and Ronald Araujo. Barcelona will also be hoping to sign a midfielder in the summer to cover their defensive midfield position and the possible exit of De Jong. Leao's market value stands around €150m but Barcelona would be hoping to get him for a lesser fee if they make a good offer.

I'd put Mount in as an attacking right sided attacker, he would have a vital dual role, and a new CM in the middle.”Basically, the Man United supporter is indicating that Mount should be played on the right – but in a much more narrower role than Antony or any traditional winger. It must be noted that the Englishman has had the experience of playing as a right-winger, having done so at Chelsea. In this narrow role, he would basically cover duties on the wings, link up with Diogo Dalot and also add more energy and creativity by trying to move into central areas to get among the goals.Going by this supporter’s vision, here is how Man United can look like this season and next season with Mount replacing Antony on the right.3 best pics as Mason Mount works hard in Carrington gym'A team that's struggling and has negativity': Frank Lampard explains Mount's struggles Man United, 2024-01-27T21:14:00.000Z, Redcafe\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-01-28-the-2023-premier-league-disappointment/, Alex, The 2023 Premier League Disappointment, The American sports portal ESPN has presented its traditional selection of disappointments in the English Premier League. The Ukrainian winger of London's Chelsea, Mykhailo Mudryk, is also included. A little more than a year ago, the most expensive and talked-about transfer in the history of Ukrainian football occurred. Mudryk was marketed as an exceptional football talent, standing among the world's most accomplished players. The best clubs in the Premier League fought for him, and the expectations of him were sky-high. But in a year of playing for Chelsea, Mudryk has fallen to the year's disappointment.\\xa0Who is Mudryk?\\xa0Mykhailo Mudryk is a Ukrainian football player who plays winger for Chelsea and the Ukrainian national team. He was born on January 5, 2001, in Krasnograd, Ukraine. He began his career at Shakhtar Donetsk. In 2019, he debuted in the Ukrainian Premier League with Arsenal Kyiv. In early August 2020, he joined Chernihiv Desna until the end of the 2020/21 season.\\xa0Mudryk quickly became one of the most promising young players in Ukraine. In the 2021/22 season, he scored three goals and provided nine assists in 19 games for Shakhtar. In the 2022/23 season, he became the fastest player in the Champions League group stage and was named one of the top 10 dribblers in the tournament. In 2022, Mudryk was named the best Ukrainian footballer. In the first half of the season, he played 18 games, scoring ten goals and providing nine assists. In January 2023, Mudryk joined Chelsea for €70 million (€100 million with add-ons). He signed a contract until 2031. You can follow Chelsea team matches, game predictions, and statistics on bookmaker sites. At \", \"s://stavnice.bet/, you will find reviews of reliable world bookmakers.\\xa0Mudryk is a versatile midfielder who can play on either the left or right wing. He has good speed, excellent dribbling skills, and strong technique.\\xa0Footballer's failure in his first year at Chelsea\\xa0Note that we in no way call Mudryk a bad footballer. We are trying to understand why a well-known American publication included the Ukrainian in the list of disappointments. A year of adaptation is enough to get used to a new country, learn the language, and resolve everyday matters. There is also plenty of time to get along with a new team.\\xa0In addition, Mudryk managed to train under two Chelsea head coaches, make his debut in the Champions League playoffs, play against English teams, and be in the reserves and the starting lineup. The footballer was admired and criticized; he went through a real school of life.\\u202f\\xa0Here are the arguments why Mudryk is the disappointment of 2023:\\xa0- The first match against Liverpool made Mudryk famous, but everything went wrong. Only after a couple of months, in the 7th match against Leicester, did the Ukrainian distinguish himself with an assist on Kovacic.\\xa0- Mudryk played 38 matches out of 50 possible for his club. But the playing time indicator is impressive in a negative sense. In the Premier League this season, Mudryk appeared in less than half of the total playing time, and in the League Cup, only 24%. It is not the result that is expected from him.\\xa0- In only 38% of matches, Mudryk started on the field. It only suggests that he still has a long way to go before reaching stability.\\xa0- Four goals and four assists – that's all Mudryk did for the whole year playing for Chelsea.\\u202f\\xa0- After a couple of months after the transfer to Chelsea, Mudryk fell in price by almost a third. Things could be going better for the Ukrainian footballer.\\xa0We do not set out to criticize Mudryk as a footballer. Enough time has passed for adaptation, but he is only 23. Let's wish him success in football matches and greater effectiveness in the new season. You can support the footballer and view the statistics on the website of the online bookmaker Ivibet SI.

You need a new striker and Kylian Mbappe flatters to deceive only to bag a hefty contract in Paris. Meanwhile, Joselu will be 34 next year and frankly not clinical enough to lead the club into greater glory.You glance at the league table and you spot a small club in Catalonia punching well above their weight. Girona currently leads La Liga with a one-point gap on your beloved Real Madrid, although they've played one game more.This Girona are propelled by a beastly Ukrainian striker who goes by the name Artem Dovbyk.The powerful six-foot-two tall striker recently caught up with the sensational Jude Bellingham in the race for the Pichichi by bagging a first-half hat-trick against Sevilla. In doing so, Dovbyk grossly embarrassed Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos, making him look every bit his age. The iconic defender simply couldn't live with the ferocious Dovbyk as he watched him score a hat-trick in just 6 minutes. The question you'd be asking yourself Mr Florentino is, do I keep chasing my tail with Mbappe or go all out for a La Liga-proven ferocious striker like Dovbyk?Whatever your answer to that question is, Dovbyk is one player from that amazing Girona team who could immediately fit Real Madrid like a glove. He's not perfect, but he'll certainly fit.If Real Madrid sign Mbappe at the end of the season, Carlo Ancelotti or whoever is in charge next season must decide whether to play the Frenchman in his preferred left-wing position and bench Vinicius. Or play Mbappe as centre-forward, a position he doesn't fancy, to allow Vini to carry on playing on the left. The right wing is not even in question, neither Vini nor Mbappe will play there with a smile on their face.With Dovbyk, there would be no such debate, the gaffer simply has to switch to a 4-3-3 with Vini and Rodrygo playing on either side of the beast. Bellingham would still have the freedom to provide the overload from the number 10 position and Real Madrid will have a monstrous attack all day long.The only major drawback with Dovbyk is that he prefers to play as a focal point in attack. Real Madrid thrives on strikers who can be more involved in the build-up, dropping deep for the ball and roaming across the final third to avoid being isolated by the defence. Karim Benzema was the perfect example.Stats show that Dovbyk isn't the best passer of the ball out there. Over the past year, he's not been among the best 50% of strikers for passing-related stats, as shown in the graph by FBref below.It tells you Dovbyk is a player like Erling Haaland, another striker who has been heavily linked with Real Madrid. The 26-year-old excels in tight spaces. He can hurt any opposition in the blink of an eye with a powerful shot with his preferred left foot while also being super deadly in the air.What's more, Real Madrid won't have to break the bank to sign Dovbyk in the summer. The player should be elated if Real Madrid calls his agent, unlike Mbappe or Haaland, both of which are practically out of reach.Girona paid €7.75m to sign Dovbyk from Dnipro last summer. Agreed, his market value has gone up since then with Transfermarkt putting it at €28m, but that's nowhere near the mind-boggling millions being quoted to sign and pay Mbappe.Over to you. Would you sign Artem Dovbyk if you were Florentino?

Brighton are already in talks with Leicester for Dewsbury-Hall, 25, but The Athletic understands there is a gap between their offer and what the Foxes are demanding. Leicester want at least £30 million for the talented midfielder, who has smashed nine goals and assisted nine more already this season. If Brighton refuse to meet their valuation, Arsenal could make a move. The Athletic also adds that Edu believes Dewsbury-Hall is just what the Gunners need. However, Arsenal have their hands tied from signing him this month, thanks to Financial Fair Play restrictions. Knowing what Dewsbury-Hall is capable of, Leicester are not likely to accept anything below £30 million; that's still a pretty modest fee. If the Englishman does end up joining Arsenal, here's how he'd fit Mikel Arteta's XI. Alongside Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, Dewsbury-Hall could slot in as the perfect creative addition.

But why is that so? Relevo explains. Real Madrid no longer views Barcelona as a serious competitor both on the pitch and financially. They say Barcelona have enough problems already with their huge debt and Financial Fair Play restrictions and Real Madrid shouldn't add to them. Madrid also firmly believes that Barca can no longer compete against them in the transfer market with their current problems. For example, Real Madrid easily paid €100m for Jude Bellingham and did so a summer ago for Aurelien Tchouameni. Real see this as the price set for quality players nowadays, with players like Josko Gvardiol (€90m), Caicedo (€115m) and Enzo Fernandez (€105m) being prime examples. Barca can't compete on that front as the Blaugrana pursues players they can sign for free. What's more, Real Madrid doesn't want more problems for Barca as the Catalans remain their only ally in the Super League project. They would rather see Barca survive financially and help them make the Super League come true than be buried forever under a mountain of debt. Real Madrid did not officially respond to Barca president Joan Laporta when he accused Los Blancos of piling pressure on referees to get them to whistle in their favour.

Arsenal potentially stand the chance to sign the French World Cup winner for free, with Real Madrid reportedly out of the race. If Edu can pull off the blockbuster transfer of the summer, here are three ways the Gunners could include Mbappe in their starting XI. 2-striker formationThe first option sees a midfield diamond deployed with Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli positioned a little deeper than usual. Up top, there is Mbappe alongside Leandro Trossard, who has a creative flair. Add Martin Odegaard to that mix and this could be a lethal combination that guarantees goals from several players for Arsenal. Sole striker This option is quite simple - Mbappe replaces Gabriel Jesus as the striker up top, with Martinelli and Saka on the wings. The midfield and the defence remain the same; this could be a great way for Mikel Arteta to play when an injury befalls Jesus. As a wingerMbappe is also adept at playing on the left wing, meaning he could be deployed there. However, doing so would make life very difficult for Martinelli as he may spend most of his time on the bench. The combination of Mbappe and Saka working together down the wings sounds very tantalising. Also, Oleksandr Zinchenko's creativity down the left side could land goals on a silver platter for Mbappe.

He's up there with some of the best dribblers in the world and his injury record lately has been much better, as compared to earlier in his career. His contract ends in 2025 so Bayern wouldn't be too reluctant to sell him.Mohammed KudusThe Ghanaian has made himself known to Premier League fans since his arrival at West Ham this season, scoring 6 league goals along with 3 in the Europa League and 1 in the Carabao Cup.Kudus is only 23 but the talent is very clear to see. Unlike his Ajax teammate Antony, who has flopped at Man United, Kudus took to the Premier League like fish to water. His work rate in incredible and his goals are usually pretty spectacular.The Ghanaian is valued at €50 million according to Transfermarkt.com but the Hammers will be hard to buy from, given his performances continue to raise his stock.Michael OliseOlise is one of the most exciting young wingers in the Premier League with the joint-highest dribble success rate on this list.His hamstring has been a bit of an issue for the Crystal Palace player recently and he is currently out for two months with that injury. He has already missed 13 games earlier this season due to a hamstring injury so that could be something for Liverpool to consider.At his best, Olise is a great ball carrier and has the finesse to finish and create chances for his teammates.RaphinhaBrazilian winger Raphinha had a couple of impressive seasons at Leeds and scored 11 goals in the 2021/22 season, which earned him a move to Barcelona.He hasn't been as impressive at Barca but he still managed 7 goals and 7 assists in La Liga in 2022/23.This season Raphinha has 3 goals and 6 assists in all competitions but has been plagued with muscle injuries.

The club's hierarchy doesn't believe Barca can win La Liga and the Champions League this season. However, the Copa Del Rey is a more realistic target. If Xavi fails to win it his future could be up in the air. However, Xavi's team are also expected to compete well in the other two competitions regardless of what the eventual outcome is. But the gaffer's future won't be determined by the outcome of those competitions. Real Madrid are already out of the Copa Del Rey which leaves Atletico Madrid as Barca's most potent rival in the competition. But the Blaugrana must first overcome Athletic Bilbao in the quarter-final later today, January 24. Barcelona are expected to beat Napoli in the Champions League round of 16 and progress to the quarter-final. In La Liga, they are seven points behind Real Madrid and eight behind Girona.

Here is what he may offer the Catalans next season.***Alguacil is a really flexible coach who has tried plenty of different formations since taking over in the Basque Country. One of his most popular picks is the 4-4-2 diamond that would suit today’s Barca side quite well.Imanol has made the most out of his starting centre-back pairing, even turning Robin Le Normand into a permanent starter for Spain. His full-backs are normally the weakest defensive links, but at least he has made them a dangerous offensive weapon after the club signed Arsenal’s Kieran Tierney and Rennes’ Hamari Traore to reinforce both wings.Alguacil puts much emphasis on the midfielders as a main creative force, so his team is usually pretty much possession-based (55.2 per cent on average this season). Martin Zubimendi, Mikel Merino, Brais Mendez and Takefusa Kubo have all turned into one of La Liga’s best players largely thanks to Alguacil’s impact. Given how well he works with domestic talent, he would obviously be thrilled to coach players like Pedri and Gavi.Up front, Alguacil prefers to have two forwards, one of whom covers plenty of distance and connects the midfield with an out-and-out striker –\\xa0Vitor Roque or Lamine Yamal could do this job perfectly.Let’s take a look at the potential line-ups.Line-up 1Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Inigo, Balde; De Jong; Gavi, Pedri; Gundogan; Lewandowski, Roque.The best-available option if Barca make no new signings –\\xa0and surely with former Real Sociedad player Inigo Martinez as a starter.Line-up 2Ter Stegen; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Balde; Zubimendi; Gavi, Pedri; Kubo; Lewandowski, Yamal.Alguacil just has to bring Zubimendi to Camp Nou if he takes over at Barca –\\xa0the defensive midfielder is among Blaugrana’s hottest targets and has been on fire under the Basque boss.Another big signing might be Takefusa Kubo who was reportedly wanted by Xavi last year.

But things turned quickly in the next 20 minutes as Barca conceded twice in three minutes to set up a pulsating finish to the game. Barcelona showed signs of defensive weakness as early as the 4th minute when their high line was exposed by a sublime Isco pass for Luis Enrique. This would be Barca's biggest undoing all game, and it nearly cost Xavi's men some precious points. Isco unlocks Enrique here way too easilyFortunately for Barca, Enrique puts his attempted lob over the barIsco would score in the 56th minute via a half-volley but it was his second goal three minutes later that explains why Barcelona are struggling to keep clean sheets. One through ball unravels Barca's high line again and Isco has the simplest of touches to beat Inaki Pena. Inaki Pena found himself in no man's land on this occasion and was easily beaten. Barca's goalie looked unsure of himself throughout the game. Notice he was also guilty of punching the ball straight to Isco for Betis' first goal?He wasn't even challenged by a Betis player when he made the error.In the end, Pena once again failed to keep a clean sheet. He's only managed one clean sheet in La Liga since Ter Stegen got injured. Barca's defence have been questionable all season but it's not hard to tell they could be doing better with a more experienced goalie between the sticks. Ter Stegen won't be back till mid-February, sadly. Here's a lineup that highlights Barca's weak spots in their win against Betis:It must be noted that Barcelona's attack was breathtaking on the night with Ferran Torres netting a hat-trick. Although Lewandowski didn't really impress, everyone else around him stepped up to bury Betis. Lamine Yamal's brilliance has already been well-documented while Joao Felix came off the bench to score a sublime goal. Barca's superior attacking force is exactly why they came away from Betis with all three points. But their defense again left a lot to be desired.

He caused that equalizer by making a darting run into the box before his effort struck Gabriel Magalhaes for an own goal.He troubled the Gunners with a few sharp shot attempts and worked his socks off, but wasn’t really complimented by his teammates.Alexis Mac Allister also excelled in that no.6 role in a chaotic game.

As you gear up for the big event, it's essential to be aware of the dos and don'ts that can shape your experience and that of those around you.This guide will steer you through the nuances of good match day etiquette, ensuring that your presence contributes to the vibrant and positive atmosphere every football fan seeks. So, whether you're a seasoned supporter or a first-timer, let's dive straight into the key considerations that will make your match day memorable and enjoyable for all.Dos for Football FansIt’s our collective responsibility to make sure every football match is enjoyable for all of those involved. Here are some things you should do on and before the big day.Arrive Early and Be PreparedTo ensure the day goes smoothly, make sure you allow adequate travel time and arrive at the match early. This will allow you to soak in the pre-game excitement, find your seat without trouble, and contribute to a smoother flow of the crowd. Be prepared by packing essentials like tickets, identification, and any other items you need for the day. Above all, arrive with a smile, and enjoy your time in the stadium.Respect Seating AssignmentsRespecting seating assignments is another fundamental aspect of a positive match day experience. Remaining in your designated seat and avoiding seat changes helps prevent confusion and potential conflicts, allowing everyone to fully relish the game. It's a simple yet crucial gesture that showcases consideration for fellow fans and maintains the integrity of the seating arrangement.Support Your Team ResponsiblyCheering your team on adds to the whole atmosphere in the stadium, but doing so responsibly is key to maintaining a positive atmosphere. Cheer passionately, wave your team colours, and engage in chants that uplift without resorting to offensive language or gestures. You should avoid taunting rival fans and focus on celebrating your team's achievements rather than the opposing team's downfalls.\\xa0Follow Stadium Rules and RegulationsAdhering to stadium rules will keep you out of trouble and ensure everyone has a pleasant match day. Before you go, familiarise yourself with prohibited items, smoking areas, and emergency procedures. Follow entry and exit protocols, as these will contribute to efficient flow of the crowd.\\xa0Handle Tickets ResponsiblyKeep hold of your tickets and treat them as valuable assets! Avoid bending or tearing them, and make sure they're not exposed to adverse conditions such as rain. A well-looked-after ticket guarantees you entry to the match and prevents any last-minute complications.Once you've reached the stadium, be mindful of the specified entry gates and access points on the ticket — this will save you time and hassle, preventing you from ending up at the wrong gate.Purchase Tickets Through Authorised SourcesAlways buy your Premier League tickets and other football tickets through authorised sources to guarantee a legitimate and secure purchase. Buying from reputable outlets or the official website ensures authenticity, reducing the risk of scams or counterfeit tickets. You'll also be contributing to a fair and regulated ticketing system, promoting authentic ticket providers.Don’ts for Football FansAmongst the excitement of the game, there are a few things you should always avoid in order to maintain a positive atmosphere for everyone:\\xa0Excessive DrinkingIndulging in excessive alcohol consumption not only poses risks to your own well-being but can also lead to disruptive behaviour that affects those around you. It's crucial to drink responsibly, allowing everyone to partake in the match day festivities without any negative incidents.Offensive BehaviourSportsmanship is a cornerstone of the football experience. Avoid engaging in offensive language, gestures, or taunts directed at players, officials, or fellow fans. Respecting the diverse fan base contributes to an inclusive and enjoyable atmosphere for everyone present.Unauthorised AccessStadiums have designated areas for a reason, and attempting unauthorised access can lead to disruptions and security concerns — which could potentially disrupt the entire match. It's important to respect the rules and guidelines set by the venue, ensuring a secure and organised environment for all attendees.Excessive NoiseWhile passionate support is encouraged, it's essential to be mindful of the noise level. Excessive shouting or disruptive behaviour can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game for fellow fans. Striking a balance allows everyone to revel in the excitement without unnecessary disturbances.Violence or Aggressive BehaviourIt goes without saying that violence and aggressive behaviour has no place in our football stadiums. Any form of aggressive behaviour is strictly prohibited, and a zero-tolerance policy is in effect. If you witness or experience such incidents, you should always report them to security so the matter can be dealt with.\\xa0Misuse of TicketsMisuse of tickets is a serious violation of football match etiquette and can have consequences for both individuals and the overall fan experience. Avoid and report any fraudulent activities and unauthorised transferring or selling or tickets. You should also be aware that the consequences for misuse of tickets can result in legal action and bans from future events.\\xa0ConclusionIn the world of football, good ticketing etiquette is the key to an enjoyable match day experience. It's not just about having a piece of paper that grants you access; it's about creating a positive atmosphere for everyone.\\xa0Respecting your assigned seating, arriving early, and supporting your team with enthusiasm while being mindful of fellow fans are the building blocks of good match day etiquette., 2024-02-08T10:35:33.000Z, nan\\n\", \"s://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-18-kalvin-phillips-stance-on-possible-barca-move-revealed/, Kingsley_, Kalvin Phillips' stance on possible Barca move revealed, Kalvin Phillips is keen on signing for Barcelona this January, per Diario Sport.

The Sussex club have built a reputation in recent years for unearthing gems from all over the world in the transfer market. Players such as Alexis Mac Allister, Moisés Caicedo, Marc Cucurella and Kaoru Mitoma are examples of those to have been signed for relative peanuts and become Premier League stars, often moving on for several times the money they arrived for. Such has been Brighton’s hit rate in the transfer market it’s become a running joke that any obscure player they acquire is immediately linked with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United for £100 million+ before they’ve even played a game for the club. In late January 2022, they struck a deal with Union Saint-Gilloise – helped by Brighton chairman Tony Bloom being the majority owner of the Belgian side at the time – for striker Deniz Undav. It seemed to make a lot of sense, though Undav returned to USG for the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign on loan. Brighton, managed at the time by Graham Potter, had a talented team that were impressive in most areas, just not at putting the ball in the net. They averaged 12.9 shots per game in the Premier League that season but scored just 42 goals. Despite finishing ninth in the league, only the three relegated teams (Burnley, Watford and Norwich City) scored fewer goals, while the same trio were the only ones to underperform by more against their expected goals (xG) total. Brighton’s 42 goals came from an overall xG of 47.2. It was obvious they needed a goalscorer, and Undav had been just that in Belgium. He scored 17 goals in 26 games as USG got promoted to the top flight in 2020-21, before recording 18 in 25 games in the regular season of the Belgian Pro League and another eight in 14 in the playoffs. He seemed to be ideal for Brighton’s needs. Undav was not exactly a young prospect – he was 26 by the start of the 2022-23 season – and he had only had two years as a professional after previously playing for amateur clubs Havelse and Meppen before moving to USG in 2020. Potter was therefore patient with him, opting to start the campaign with Danny Welbeck up front. The experienced former Man Utd and Arsenal forward was not scoring goals but Brighton were doing well with him in the team, taking 10 points from their first four games. Undav made his debut in a 3-0 win at Forest Green Rovers in the EFL Cup, getting his name on the scoresheet in the process. However, with Potter leaving for Chelsea soon after and Roberto De Zerbi coming in, Undav didn’t see much playing time, especially with teenager Evan Ferguson emerging as another option up front. Two more goals came in the FA Cup against Grimsby and Middlesbrough, but Undav was finding it difficult to make his mark against Premier League opposition. By late April, he had made 14 league appearances but accumulated just 266 minutes in total and was yet to score a goal. His struggles were somewhat typified in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United when he replaced Welbeck in the 75th minute. With the game finely poised and going to extra-time, Undav had a chance to make himself a hero at Wembley. In his 45 minutes on the pitch, though, he lost possession eight times and failed to have a single shot. He did score his penalty in the shootout, which Brighton ultimately lost, but there were multiple occasions during the game where he was presented with opportunities only to fail to get a shot away, and a more confident player could have won it for his team. That proved to be a turning point, though. A brace in a 6-0 win against Wolves got him off the mark in the Premier League and was the start of a burst of five goals in 353 league minutes (eight games) before the end of the season. Undav revealed a talk he’d had with De Zerbi that helped him focus his mind and regain his confidence. “It was after the Manchester United game, I had a conversation with the gaffer – it was a hard one, but it made it click in my head,” he told Sussex Live last May. “Since that moment I have got better and better and I finally scored my goals. “I knew what he wanted from me then and I was building more confidence than I had in the beginning and that’s credit to him. Because he’s a gaffer who will tell you the truth, he will not speak left or right, he will tell it to your face… He wanted me to give more energy because it looked like I wasn’t 100% into the game because of my body language. I was always like this so it’s difficult for me to change, but I have really tried and I think my high-intensity runs are higher than they were in the beginning. “He wanted me to be confident enough to use my body and my strength in the game, to run at high intensity, not just jogging, really proper running. I think I have improved when I see clips from the last games compared to the beginning of the season – it’s a different Deniz. I have tried to get better and better every day.” It was therefore somewhat surprising when Undav was allowed to join Stuttgart on a season-long loan ahead of the 2023-24 campaign. Brighton’s signing of João Pedro from Watford will have been a factor, but it looked on the surface as though the club were admitting defeat in turning the German into their latest transfer success story. De Zerbi suggested that the player would still have a future with the club, saying: “Last year he was crucial for us in achieving our goals, but he deserves that chance. We wish him well for the season with Stuttgart and we look forward to welcoming him back at the end of the season.” So, that was it then? Undav was a rare miss in Brighton’s otherwise stellar record of recent signings. Well, not quite. He has been an absolute sensation in the Bundesliga. He hasn’t even allowed himself to be overshadowed by the astonishing form of strike partner Serhou Guirassy as he has helped Stuttgart to third place after 21 games. Undav has 14 goals in 18 games (13 starts), while he also has four assists to his name. If he finds the net against Darmstadt on Saturday, he will become just the third player in Bundesliga history to score at least 15 goals in his first 19 appearances in the competition after Uwe Seeler (19) and Klaus Matischak (17). His talk with De Zerbi coupled with the influence of impressive Stuttgart boss Sebastian Hoeneß appears to have unlocked something in him, arguably the same thing that saw him score goals for fun in Belgium. Undav mentioned his desire to improve his high-intensity running and has been true to his word. His sprints per 90 have gone up from 19.6 in the Premier League last season to 26.9 in the Bundesliga in 2023-24. As you can see from his heat maps below for Brighton in the Premier League and Stuttgart in the Bundesliga, he is covering more of the pitch in Germany as he plays in a more withdrawn attacking role, and both he and his new team are reaping the rewards. Undav’s improved confidence in front of goal was particularly on show in last month’s 5-2 thrashing of RB Leipzig as he scored three times. It may not have been considered a ‘hat-trick’ in the German sense of the term (a ‘lupenreiner’ hat-trick requires three goals in one half with no others being scored in between), but in England it would be considered a ‘perfect hat-trick’, with Undav scoring with his right foot, head and left foot. 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 💥Here's another look at Deniz #Undav's hat-trick in the 5-2 win against Leipzig 🙌⤵️#VfB | #VfBRBL 5-2 pic.twitter.com/qIoN6RInnl He has been more involved in Stuttgart’s attacks this season on average than any of his teammates. Undav is averaging 7.8 attacking sequence involvements in the Bundesliga per 90, more than any other Stuttgart player to have played at least 450 minutes. Notably, he is averaging 4.5 shots per 90, suggesting his confidence in front of goal has very much returned. Of players to have scored at least two goals this season, only Guirassy (1.50), Bayer Leverkusen’s Nathan Tella (1.47) and Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane (1.40) average more than Undav’s 1.33 goal involvements per 90 in the Bundesliga.  Such has been his impact, Undav was given the Bundesliga’s Player of the Month award for January, another milestone in his development as a player now he’s getting regular games in a team that gives him a clear and defined role. Deniz the menace! 🔥Your @EASportsFC #BundesligaPOTM is @VfB's sharp shooting striker Deniz Undav! 🎯🤍❤️#FC24 | #Bundesliga pic.twitter.com/elXSGlgadh His aim now is to be a part of Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany squad for the summer’s Euro 2024 tournament on home soil. Undav has never represented his country at any level, but like Borussia Dortmund’s Niclas Füllkrug, he could be a late bloomer who can address Germany’s recent dearth of talent up top. De Zerbi may wish to give Undav another chance with Brighton next season, though the Italian’s own future remains up in the air with links to the upcoming managerial vacancies at Liverpool and Barcelona. Reports suggest Stuttgart do have a purchase option in the loan deal that will be dependent on Undav’s performances for VfB, and Hoeneß wants to keep him around. “[We are] certainly prepared to go to extremes [to sign him permanently],” the Stuttgart boss recently said. “In the end it’s a business but emotions and passion are also part of it. That’s why I have great hope that we can continue with him. “It’s impressive how he presents himself in the Bundesliga. He does special things on the pitch, but he’s also really cool and positive off the pitch. He’s not a normal guy, in the best sense of the word.” Whether Undav’s long-term future will be back at Brighton or continuing with Stuttgart, he is finally looking like the player the Seagulls thought he was when they signed him in 2022.  While he may not go down in history as a Brighton great, he can at least be considered another example of their recruitment staff spotting a player who can thrive in a top European league. Who knows? Perhaps Stuttgart will be the ones who need to block Chelsea’s phone number in future transfer windows. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Is more entertainment in store? We look ahead to the game with our Manchester City vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Manchester City and Chelsea played out what was surely the game of the Premier League season so far when they last met in November, sharing eight goals in a topsy-turvy draw at Stamford Bridge. They face off again in Saturday’s return fixture, with City in ominous form and Chelsea looking to build on Monday’s morale-boosting victory at Crystal Palace. Is another classic in store? Man City should certainly be expected to uphold their part of the bargain. Pep Guardiola’s men are in irresistible form, with their current 11-game winning streak across all competitions their longest since a 21-match run between December 2020 and March 2021. They remained within two points of Premier League leaders Liverpool with last Saturday’s 2-0 win over Everton, before resuming their UEFA Champions League defence with a 3-1 victory over FC Copenhagen on Wednesday. Kevin De Bruyne played a starring role in midweek, opening the scoring himself before winning a challenge to tee up Bernardo Silva for City’s second goal and pulling the ball back into the path of Phil Foden for a late third. De Bruyne has wasted no time in getting back up to speed following a five-month injury lay-off, assisting a goal in all four of City’s Premier League games in 2024 despite only starting two of them. He now has a chance to become just the 11th different player to assist a goal on five or more consecutive appearances in the competition, and the first to do so for the Citizens. De Bruyne also has 66 Premier League assists at the Etihad Stadium, with only Manchester United great Ryan Giggs (84 at Old Trafford) ever recording more at a single venue. Against Everton, De Bruyne teed up the second of Erling Haaland’s two goals with a defence-splitting through ball, his 12th assist for the Norwegian in all competitions since the start of last season. That is the most managed by any Premier League player for a specific teammate in that time. The in-form Foden should maintain his place in the lineup alongside De Bruyne, though Jérémy Doku could return on the left flank after starting Wednesday’s game among the substitutes. Doku leads all Premier League players for chances created from open play per 90 minutes this season (2.68), also ranking second to Aston Villa’s Leon Bailey for open-play expected assists (xA) per 90 (0.32). Halting City’s momentum looks a daunting task, but Chelsea enter Saturday’s game in positive spirits after back-to-back road wins over Aston Villa (in the FA Cup) and Crystal Palace (in the Premier League). The Blues trailed to Jefferson Lerma’s stunning strike at Selhurst Park on Monday, only to rally after the half-time introduction of Christopher Nkunku sparked a change to a 4-2-2-2 formation. Former Palace loanee Conor Gallagher struck twice to put Chelsea ahead, then Enzo Fernández rounded off a 3-1 win in stoppage time. Cole Palmer recorded two assists, taking him to 16 goal contributions (10 goals, six assists) in a fine first Premier League season with Chelsea. The most memorable moment of his debut campaign with the Blues, though, remains his stoppage-time penalty in the reverse fixture against City. Raheem Sterling also scored in that game, and he and Palmer are both looking to net home and away against their former club in the same season, something no ex-City player has previously done in the Premier League. In team news, Sterling faces a battle for a starting berth here, however, with Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke preferred in the wide areas against Palace. Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino is eyeing a landmark victory on Saturday, with his four previous wins over Guardiola coming with three different clubs (Espanyol, Tottenham – twice – and Paris Saint-Germain). José Mourinho is the only boss to beat Guardiola with four different teams, with the ‘Special One’ doing so while in charge of Inter, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Spurs. However, Pochettino has lost more matches against Guardiola (13) than he has against any other manager across all competitions. Ahead of kick-off, the Argentine’s main selection dilemma is in defence after Thiago Silva appeared to suffer a groin problem against Palace. With the EFL Cup final against Liverpool on the horizon, Pochettino may opt against risking the Brazilian at the Etihad Stadium, though first-choice goalkeeper Robert Sánchez is nearing a return after almost two months out with a knee injury. Reece James, Benoit Badiashile and Marc Cucurella remain long-term absentees. November’s thrilling 4-4 draw between the sides ended a run of 16 Premier League meetings between them without a stalemate. They last played out two draws in a single campaign in 2014-15. Meanwhile, the most goals ever scored between City and Chelsea in a single Premier League season was the nine recorded in 2009-10, when City posted 2-1 and 4-2 victories against the eventual champions. That record looks to be under severe threat here. Indeed, Chelsea have only managed one clean sheet in their last 19 league games against City, with that shutout coming in a 2-0 home win under Maurizio Sarri in December 2018. City, meanwhile, have won six of their last eight home league outings against the Blues. Julián Álvarez scored the only goal in this exact fixture last May, with Guardiola’s side lifting the Premier League trophy after that game. Should Chelsea score twice on Saturday, they would make a piece of history, becoming the first team to ever net six league goals against a side managed by Guardiola in a single campaign. City’s home form has been imperious of late, with the champions going unbeaten throughout their last 22 Premier League fixtures at the Etihad, winning 18 and drawing four. Saturday’s hosts are also on the longest ongoing scoring run on home soil in the competition, netting in each of their last 44 matches at the Etihad Stadium and bringing up a mammoth tally of 135 goals in those games. Overall, Man City have won their last six games in England’s top flight in a row, having only won one of their previous six (four draws, one defeat). The last four of City’s victories have come in 2024, and they could now win their first five Premier League matches in a calendar year for just the second time, having previously started 2021 with 13 straight victories. Chelsea, meanwhile, have posted back-to-back victories on the road in all competitions, having lost six of their previous seven on their travels (one win). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. While City and Chelsea have become accustomed to battling for major honours in recent years, City enter Saturday’s game as heavy favourites. Indeed, the Opta supercomputer gives the champions a 64.0% chance of victory, with Chelsea only picking up three points in 13.6% of match simulations and 22.4% finishing all square. In the Opta season predictions, Manchester City are now assigned a 64.6% chance of defending their domestic crown, ahead of Liverpool (25.5%) and Arsenal (9.7%). Following Aston Villa’s defeat to Tottenham on Matchday 24, no other team is assigned more than a 0.1% chance of topping the pile. Chelsea, meanwhile, are expected to finish squarely in mid-table. They finish 10th in a league-high 22% of the supercomputer’s season simulations, only making the top seven in 15.4% of scenarios. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the Premier League clash at Turf Moor with our Burnley vs Arsenal prediction and preview. After blowing the Premier League title race wide open with victory over Liverpool and humiliating West Ham last time out, Arsenal will be looking to send another warning to fellow top-flight contenders when they visit struggling Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday. Mikel Arteta’s side overcame Jürgen Klopp’s Reds 3-1 before smashing West Ham 6-0 at London Stadium last Sunday. That victory saw Arsenal record their joint-biggest margin of victory in an away league match and their first such win by six goals since December 1935 against Aston Villa (7-1). It moved the Gunners within two points of league-leading Liverpool and level with second-placed Manchester City – who have played a game fewer – in the league table heading into Matchday 25. Declan Rice scored one and assisted another two against his former employers, with Bukayo Saka (2), William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhães and Leandro Trossard also on target in the London derby thrashing. The win at London Stadium saw Arsenal further display their strength at set pieces. They’ve scored the most goals from corners of any team in the Premier League this season (11), with each of the last three being headers from centre-backs (two from Gabriel and one from Saliba). With his two goals last weekend, Saka became the fifth-youngest player to score 50 goals for Arsenal – aged 22 years and 159 days. In all competitions, Saka has 70 goals and assists combined since the start of the 2021-22 season (40 goals, 30 assists), with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah the only Premier League player to match that output during the same period. Though Saka took the credit for his goal-scoring prowess at London Stadium, Martin Ødegaard also assisted twice – only Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes has created more Premier League chances this season than the Arsenal captain and Saka (61 each).  Across his career, Ødegaard has created an opportunity every 37 minutes for his teammates in the Premier League; the only two Arsenal players (minimum 90 minutes played) with a better minutes-per-chance created ratio are Mesut Özil (27) and Cesc Fàbregas (32) since Opta began collecting such data in 2003-04. Aside from Arteta’s wealth of attacking riches, Arsenal’s lineup for Saturday’s kick-off could be boosted by numerous returning stars. Gabriel Jesus, Fábio Vieira, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Emile Smith Rowe and Oleksandr Zinchenko could all make comebacks, though Jurriën Timber and Thomas Partey remain out injured. As for the out-of-form hosts, Burnley manager Vincent Kompany will be fearing an immediate return to the Championship as his side sit 19th in the league table, some seven points adrift of safety and 17th-placed Luton Town, who still have a game in hand heading into MD 25. Burnley were defeated 3-1 against Liverpool at Anfield last Saturday, falling to second-half goals from Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez after Dara O’Shea had cancelled out Diogo Jota’s opener on MD 24. That defeat saw the Clarets concede their 50th goal in their 24th Premier League game this season; it’s the earliest into a league season they’ve shipped as many goals since 1932-33 (23rd game, second tier) and earliest in the top flight since 1929-30 (also 24th match). Although a positive for O’Shea against Liverpool, Burnley will have added concern considering only forwards Lyle Foster (seven) and Zeki Amdouni (five) have been involved in more Premier League goals for Kompany’s men this season than the Irish defender’s four (one goal, three assists). There’s not much positive news on the injury front for Kompany either, with Foster potentially unavailable due to a knock, while Jordan Beyer, Luca Koleosho and Nathan Redmond remain as longer-term absentees. However, ever-reliant English defender Charlie Taylor could return from a should injury if he passes a late fitness test. Kompany will be serving a touchline ban after his yellow card at Anfield last week. Burnley have won just one of their 17 Premier League games against Arsenal (D4 L12), with that victory coming at the Emirates Stadium in December 2020. The Clarets have scored just nine goals in those 17 top-flight games against Arsenal, never managing to find the net more than once in a single match. It’s the most one side has faced another in the competition without ever netting multiple goals. Kompany’s men were 3-1 losers in the reverse fixture this season, too, as Saliba and Zinchenko were on target after Josh Brownhill cancelled out Trossard’s opening goal at the Emirates back in November. The Gunners are also unbeaten in their last 10 away league games against Burnley (W5 D5), with eight of these coming in the Premier League. Only Chelsea have played away against a side more often without ever losing in the competition (nine, also against Burnley). Arsenal are one of only two sides with a 100% Premier League record in 2024 so far, winning all four games – against West Ham, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace – while scoring 16 goals. It’s only the second time they’ve won their first four league games in a year, also doing so in 1935; they’ve never won their opening five league games in a calendar year. The Gunners have scored 5+ goals in two games in 2024 already, Crystal Palace (5-0) and West Ham (6-0), as many times as they managed in the Premier League in 2023 overall (twice in 42 games). They haven’t done so in three games in one year since 2018 (three times). In complete contrast to Arsenal’s form, Burnley have taken just five points in their 12 home Premier League matches this season (W1 D2 L9), the fewest of any side. The fewest home games into a season any team has reached 10 defeats is 13, by four different teams: Sunderland (2005-06), Huddersfield Town (2018-19), Sheffield United (2020-21) and Watford (2021-22). Kompany’s side have also still not won a Premier League game this season against a side starting the day in the top half of the table. Of their nine games against teams in the top 10 on the morning of the game, the Clarets have drawn one and lost eight, conceding 24 goals. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer backs Arsenal as the heavy favourites at Turf Moor, with the visitors winning 56.0% of 10,000 pre-match simulations, compared to a Burnley triumph in just 18.3%. A draw appears a more likely hope for Kompany’s side, who secured that unlikely result in 25.7% of data-led scenarios, although a point apiece will do neither team a favour at either end of the league table. Despite impressive new-year returns, Arsenal’s title chances rank at just 9.4% – behind Man City (66.2%) and Liverpool (24.2%) – while only Sheffield United (97.9%) have a greater likelihood of relegation than Burnley’s 95.7% in Opta’s end-of-season simulation. They are ahead of Luton Town (47.3%), Nottingham Forest (29.2%) and Everton (17.2%) in the model’s relegation projections. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to their next match on Saturday with our Tottenham vs Wolves prediction and preview. Matchday 24 in the Premier League felt like an important milestone in the race for UEFA Champions League football. Brennan Johnson’s 96th-minute winner against Brighton and Hove Albion lifted Tottenham into the top four last Saturday, a position they maintained as rivals Aston Villa were beaten by Manchester United the following day. Can Ange Postecoglou’s men maintain their momentum against Wolves next time out? Questions were asked about Spurs’ game management after they conceded a 94th-minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Everton on MD 23, with their eight goals shipped in the 90th minute or later this term putting them just three shy of the single-season Premier League record set by Burnley in 2018-19 (11). However, after Pape Sarr cancelled out Pascal Groß’s penalty last week, it was Tottenham’s turn to provide the late heroics against Brighton as Johnson steered Son Heung-min’s low cross home deep into stoppage time. That was Spurs’ third 90+-minute winner in the Premier League this season, with no team scoring more (level with Manchester United). Johnson has now scored in two of his last three Premier League appearances, with both goals coming off the bench (also vs Brentford). The only previous Spurs player to score from three successive substitute appearances in the competition was Teddy Sheringham in 1994. For Son, meanwhile, his late assist marked a triumphant return to club football following South Korea’s Asian Cup campaign. He now has nine goal involvements in his last eight Premier League appearances (four goals, five assists), and 18 in total in 2023-24 (12 goals, six assists). Son is often Spurs’ man for the big occasion, and his 18 goal contributions have been worth 16 points to his team. Only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (18) has earned his team more points through goal involvements this campaign . With Son back in the fold, things are looking positive for Spurs. They are hopeful of having Giovani Lo Celso available after over a month on the sidelines with a muscle injury, while fellow midfielder Yves Bissouma returned against former club Brighton. Manor Solomon and Ryan Sessegnon both remain out. We witnessed one of the most dramatic finishes of the season when Tottenham last faced Wolves in November. Johnson’s early strike gave Spurs a lead they held until the 91st minute, only for late goals from Pablo Sarabia and Mario Lemina to complete a stunning turnaround at Molineux. That was the eighth time a team had led a Premier League game going into the 90th minute and still lost, and half of those games have involved Tottenham (two wins, two defeats). It was also the longest a Premier League team has led in a game they have gone on to lose. Gary O’Neil’s side would certainly take a repeat of that result as they look to respond to last week’s dismal 2-0 defeat to Brentford, a result that left them four points adrift of the top seven and a potential European spot. Wolves’ tally of 17 shots in that game was their highest in a home Premier League match without scoring since October 2022 (21 vs Leicester City), with O’Neil’s side struggling to break down Brentford’s low block as Christian Nørgaard and Ivan Toney netted for the Bees. Wolves also suffered a major blow in the first half as Matheus Cunha limped off with a hamstring issue. It has since been reported that he could be out for the season, which would be a problem for Wolves. The Brazilian has scored seven away Premier League goals this season, including a hat-trick in a thrilling 4-2 win at Chelsea. Only two Wolves players have ever scored more on the road in a single Premier League campaign: Steven Fletcher in 2011-12 (eight) and Raúl Jiménez in 2019-20 (nine). Wolves will at least have Hwang Hee-chan available, with the forward sitting out the Brentford game after joining Son in returning from the Asian Cup. Hwang already has 10 Premier League goals this season, two more than he managed in his two previous campaigns combined (five in 2021-22, three in 2022-23).  Hwang’s goals have come from an expected goals (xG) tally of 5.96, giving him an overperformance of 4.04. Only two Premier League players have overperformed their underlying numbers by more this season, Diogo Jota (+4.91) and Son (+4.88). With Cunha being Wolves’ only injury concern, Sarabia and Jean Ricner-Bellegarde are competing to join Hwang and Pedro Neto in their forward line. Tottenham have found it tough against Wolves lately, losing three of their last four Premier League games against them, including their dramatic defeat in the reverse fixture. Before that, Spurs also lost 1-0 to Julen Lopetegui’s Wolves last March as Adama Traoré volleyed in a late winner. Tottenham have never previously lost three successive league meetings with Wolves. Wolves, meanwhile, are looking to complete their first league double over Tottenham since 2009-10, when Mick McCarthy’s men managed 1-0 wins at both Molineux and White Hart Lane. Since their promotion back to the Premier League in 2018, Wolves have won a further three away games against Tottenham, with only Chelsea and Liverpool (four apiece) managing more road victories over them in that span.  Wolves recently went 14 Premier League matches in London without a victory, but they have won their last two in the capital in convincing fashion, beating Brentford 4-1 in December and Chelsea 4-2 earlier this month. They last won three successive top-flight games in London in September 1979. Only Liverpool (10) have won more Premier League home games this season than Tottenham (nine), with Postecoglou’s men winning each of their last five at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, having lost their previous three against Chelsea, Aston Villa and West Ham in November and December. Spurs now have the chance to reach 10 wins in as few as 13 home matches from the start of a Premier League campaign for just the third time, after 2011-12 (first 13) and 2016-17 (first 12). However, Wolves have won two of their last three away Premier League games, as many victories as they managed in their previous 17 (two wins, three draws, 12 defeats). They have netted eight times in their last three on the road, having only scored 10 goals in their previous 12.  Goals could be on the menu on Saturday, then, with Tottenham having scored in 36 successive Premier League matches. Only Arsenal, who netted in 55 straight between May 2001 and November 2002, have ever enjoyed a longer run in the competition, though the last team to shut Spurs out in the top flight was Wolves last March. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Tottenham have been irresistible on home soil of late, and the Opta supercomputer is on their side ahead of Saturday’s game. Across 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of kick-off, Spurs triumphed in 55.3% of scenarios, with Wolves given just a 19.4% chance of victory and the likelihood of a draw rated at 25.3%. In the supercomputer’s season predictions, Spurs are now given a 59.1% chance of a top four finish, finishing fourth in a league-high 51.3% of scenarios.  Wolves are only given a 9.2% chance of breaking into the top eight following their defeat to Brentford, with 11th (26.1%) their most common position in our season simulations. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the Premier League clash with our Brentford vs Liverpool prediction and preview. Liverpool will be hoping to consolidate their leading position in the three-horse Premier League title race alongside Manchester City and Arsenal when they visit Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium for Saturday’s early kick-off. Prior to the start of the Matchday 25 schedule, Liverpool will have spent every night since Boxing Day top of the Premier League (53 in a row); that’s exactly as many nights as they’d spent top of the table from the start of the 2020-21 campaign up to Christmas 2023. The Reds sit two points clear of Man City and Arsenal in the league table, though Pep Guardiola’s men still have a game in hand heading into the weekend’s fixtures. Indeed, Liverpool have 15 more points at this stage of 2023-24 (54) than they had after 24 games last season (39). On three of the last four occasions in the top flight they’ve had 54+ points after 24 games, they have finished second (1990-91, 2018-19 & 2021-22); the other was in 2019-20, when they had 70 and won the league – a feat Jürgen Klopp will want to recreate in his final season at Anfield. That position at the top comes after Klopp’s side responded to their setback against Mikel Arteta’s Gunners with a 3-1 home victory over Burnley on MD 24. Diogo Jota, Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez were all on target last Saturday as Dara O’Shea’s second-half response proved redundant for Vincent Kompany’s visitors. Trent Alexander-Arnold assisted Jota’s opener against Burnley and now has more Premier League assists than any other defender (58), edging one ahead of teammate Andy Robertson (57), but suffered another knee injury against Burnley. The England right-back will miss Saturday’s trip to Brentford, and he’s already been ruled out of the EFL Cup final against Chelsea a week on Sunday. Mohamed Salah is back in training but may not be risked before the final at Wembley. The absence of Salah has not diminished the power of Liverpool’s attacking force, with only Jota (six) involved in more Premier League goals in 2024 than Núñez (five – three goals, two assists), with the Uruguayan’s header against the Clarets his first league goal at Anfield since October against Nottingham Forest. Jota has also scored nine Premier League goals overall this season and is looking to hit double figures in a single campaign for just a second time in the competition (15 in 2021-22). The Portuguese forward has scored five goals in his last six league matches and also scored in his only previous top-flight appearance at the Gtech Community Stadium in September 2021. Aside from Salah and Alexander-Arnold, Klopp’s lineup will remain without the injured Joël Matip, Dominik Szoboszlai, Thiago Alcântara and Stefan Bajcetic. Alisson is reported to have suffered a hamstring problem so will also miss out, though Ibrahima Konaté returns from suspension and will likely partner Virgil van Dijk. Conor Bradley could come back to replace Alexander-Arnold, with Joe Gomez also available after a bout of illness. As for Saturday’s hosts, Brentford arrested a worrying run of Premier League form with a 2-0 triumph over Wolves at Molineux that lifted Thomas Frank’s side up to 14th in the league table heading into MD 25. Christian Nørgaard capitalised on Sergio Reguilón’s corner to open the scoring last Saturday before Ivan Toney netted once again after his recent return. Since Toney’s comeback at the end of January, only three players have more goals than his three strikes in four Premier League games. However, Liverpool are one of the four teams he has faced without scoring against in the competition (three games, seven shots, one shot on target).  The English talisman has also found a reliable partner in the industrious Neal Maupay. The former Brighton forward has been directly involved in exactly one goal in each of his first six home league starts for Brentford (four goals, two assists). In Premier League history, only two players have scored or assisted in their first seven home starts for a club: Alan Shearer for Newcastle United (first 15, 1996-97) and Álvaro Negredo for Man City (first 7, 2013). As for Frank’s team news, Yoane Wissa and Frank Onyeka will return from Africa Cup of Nations duty, although Josh Dasilva, Kevin Schade, Aaron Hickey, Bryan Mbeumo and Rico Henry all remain absent from Brentford’s injury-hit lineup ahead of Saturday’s early kick-off. The home side has never lost a Premier League meeting between Brentford and Liverpool (W4 D1), with the Bees winning this exact fixture 3-1 last season after an own goal from Konaté and strikes from Wissa and Mbeumo. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s second-half reply for the visitors was ultimately meaningless. However, Liverpool have never lost consecutive league fixtures against Brentford and have both scored and conceded in all seven of their away league games with Saturday’s hosts. In the reverse fixture with Brentford this term, Klopp’s men were 3-0 winners at Anfield back in November after Salah’s double and another strike from Jota propelled the Premier League title contenders to victory. Against Wolves, Brentford kept their first clean sheet across their last 13 Premier League games since their 2-0 victory at Chelsea in October – ending their longest such run without a shutout in the competition – though their home form leaves much for Frank to improve. Brentford have lost four of their last six home Premier League matches – going down to Man City, Wolves, Aston Villa and Arsenal – as many as they had in their previous 30 such home games combined (W15 D11 L4). The Bees’ most recent two league defeats at the Gtech have also come after scoring the first goal (2-1 versus Villa and 3-1 against Man City); they had only lost one of their first 25 home games when scoring first in the competition beforehand (W17 D7). Liverpool, meanwhile, have struggled in the capital. The Reds have won just two of their last eight away Premier League games in London, beating Crystal Palace this term and West Ham towards the end of last season. Indeed, both of their league defeats this season have come in such games, against Tottenham in September and Arsenal earlier this month. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Liverpool are backed to triumph at the Gtech Community Stadium, with the visitors winning 50.3% of pre-match simulations by the Opta supercomputer. Brentford only come out on top in 23.1% of 10,000 data-led scenarios, with the draw seemingly more likely as that result occurred 26.5% of the time. The Reds’ title chances still rank at 25.5%, behind Manchester City (64.6%) but ahead of Arsenal (9.7%), while Brentford’s most likely league-table finish is their current 14th position at 21.4% –though the Bees still have a slim 1.3% likelihood of relegation in Opta’s end-of-season simulations.

The Premier League season in 2023-24 is shaping up to be one of the best in recent memory. Manchester City are defending champions and the team to beat, though it looks highly competitive around them, with almost half the division starting the campaign with realistic hopes of European qualification. There is set to be an equally intense battle to avoid relegation at the bottom of the league table, with playing in the Premier League now more valuable financially than ever before. Our AI-powered Opta supercomputer will be making its match picks for every fixture over the course of what looks set to be an exciting season. Read on as Opta Analyst provides its Premier League predictions, and be sure to check back here every week. The Opta supercomputer has delivered its latest selection of match predictions ahead of a full weekend of Premier League football. Our predictive model has made its picks for the latest round of matches in what remains a crucial period of the season at both ends of the league table, with just two points still separating the top three teams in the standings. There were 10 matches last week and the supercomputer enjoyed a strong week with its picks, as favourites Manchester City, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Arsenal all emerged triumphant. However, Luton Town’s surprise loss at home to Sheffield United ensured it was not a perfect matchweek of predictions. Matchday 25 will see seven fixtures take place on Saturday, with the three top contenders – Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City – all in action for what could be a key day in the title race. Luton hosting in-form Man Utd is one of two clashes taking place on Sunday, while it’s a relegation scrap taking the spotlight on Monday as Everton do battle with Crystal Palace.Ahead of what looks set to be another entertaining group of fixtures, let’s check out the Opta supercomputer’s Premier League match predictions. Liverpool have the chance to, at least temporarily, move five points clear at the top of the table when they travel to play Brentford in the opening match on Saturday. Brentford are no longer the force they once were at home, having lost four of their last six matches in the Premier League at the Gtech Community Stadium. That tally is as many losses as they had suffered in their previous 30 combined. The visitors, meanwhile, have 15 more points at this stage of the 2023-24 season (54) than they had after 24 games in 2022-23 (39). Diogo Jota has helped them to that vastly improved total, scoring five goals in his last six top-flight matches, and he is one goal away from hitting double figures in the EPL in a season for just the second time in his career.  Liverpool are backed to record a victory here, with their win probability at 50.3% and Brentford down at 23.1%. Arsenal are looking to make it five consecutive Premier League wins when they play away to struggling Burnley. At 56.0%, the Gunners are the most likely away winners this week, with Vincent Kompany’s side given just an 18.3% chance by our predictive model. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 10 away league games against Burnley with five wins and five draws. They also have Bukayo Saka in fine form after he netted twice at West Ham to hit 10 league goals for the campaign. With his brace, Saka became the fifth-youngest player to score 50 goals for Arsenal at 22 years and 159 days old. The England international has 40 goals and 30 assists in all competitions since the start of the 2021-22 season, with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah the only other Premier League player to hit both of those numbers in that time. Aston Villa have slipped out of the top-four positions ahead of what might be a testing trip to play Fulham at Craven Cottage. Fulham have beaten Villa in three of the last four Premier League home matches and are on strong form in front of their own fans, winning six of their last nine top-flight games and scoring three or more goals in five of those wins. However, the Villans – who lost to Man Utd last time out – do not often lose back-to-back games and something that’s not happened in the league at all this season. Villa are given the most marginal edge but with their win rate at 38.9%, there’s every chance of Fulham getting something from the game. The hosts are rated at 31.8%, with the draw a live threat at 29.3%. Newcastle United have not given up on European qualification and will look to follow up their win at Nottingham Forest last week by defeating slumping Bournemouth on home soil. Bournemouth are looking to complete a league double over Newcastle for the first time and Eddie Howe is yet to beat his former club in three league attempts. However, the Cherries are winless in five and they face a Newcastle team who have scored 51 times in 24 matches this season – the earliest into a top-flight season they’ve hit 50+ goals since 1960-61. Newcastle are given a 58.3% chance of victory, which is the supercomputer’s second-most confident match prediction of the week. The match between Nottingham Forest (30.9%) and West Ham (40.6%) will see two teams struggling for form do battle. Forest have lost nine of their last 13 Premier League matches, while West Ham have lost both of their last two, conceding nine goals in the process. The Hammers are yet to win in seven matches across all competitions in 2024, although they will fondly remember their 3-2 home comeback win in November’s reverse fixture. West Ham are narrowly favoured here, but look out for the draw, which is a threat at 28.5%. Tottenham (55.3%) and Wolves (19.4%) will both be reasonably happy with their positions in the league table before they face off in London. It is Spurs who go in as strong favourites for this one, despite losing three of the last four clashes between the sides. Only Liverpool (10) have won more home games in the 2023-24 campaign than Tottenham (9), who have won five in a row front of their own fans. They now have Son Heung-min back from the Asian Cup and the South Korea star set up Brennan Johnson’s added-time winner against Brighton. As part of an impressive bounce back season, Son has been directly involved in nine goals in his last eight top-flight games, with four goals and five assists. The early evening fixture will see rampant Man City take on a Chelsea team who were relieved to earn a much-needed league victory against Palace last time out. City have had the better of this fixture of late, winning six of the last eight meetings at home, with five clean sheets. Pep Guardiola’s team are also on a formidable 22-match unbeaten run at home in the league and have scored in 44 straight matches at the Etihad. They have Kevin De Bruyne in supreme form and the Belgium international will become the first ever Man City player to record an assist in five successive Premier League matches if he creates another goal in this one. Like De Bruyne, Chelsea’s Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer will face their former club and both have the chance to become the first player to score against Man City home and away in the same Premier League campaign, having netted in the reverse fixture. Manchester City remain the top side in the Opta Power Rankings, as they have been all season, but Chelsea’s mixed form over the last few years means that they are ranked outside the top 30 teams. At 64.0%, Man City are the Opta supercomputer’s highest conviction pick this week, with Cheslea given just a 13.6% chance. There was a thrilling 4-4 draw between the sides in November and Mauricio Pochettino would likely be glad to take another point, with the draw rated at 22.4%. Into Sunday’s fixtures and Sheffield United will hope last weekend’s win over Luton can spark a run of form as they prepare to take on mid-table Brighton. Despite the Blades winning last Saturday and Brighton generally looking short of their best, Roberto De Zerbi’s team are well backed at 53.2%, making them the second-most likely away winners after Arsenal across the 10 fixtures. Pascal Groß could be key to their hopes after being involved in nine goals in his last 11 top-flight starts, with two goals and seven assists. Luton might wish they had faced Man Utd at a different point of the season, as Erik ten Hag’s side travel to Kenilworth Road seeking a fourth straight league win and fifth in a row across all competitions. Man United have had few issues defeating promoted opponents under Ten Hag, and are eying a 12th straight such victory, which would match their best previous streak in the competition recorded under Sir Alex Ferguson from 2011 to 2013. Rasmus Højlund has the chance to make Premier League history, following a remarkable turnaround after starting his career in the competition with a 14-game goal drought. If the 21-year-old scores for a sixth straight Premier League match, he will become the youngest ever player to achieve the feat, beating the record currently held by Joe Willock.  Man Utd are favourites at 46.5%, but our model still gives Luton a decent chance of getting something from the game. They are rated at 26.5%, with the draw a shade more likely at 27.0%. Everton (38.8%) have the chance to drag Crystal Palace (31.6%) even closer to the relegation scrap when the two teams play at Goodison Park on Monday. This is set to be a close contest and is the most likely of the 10 fixtures to finish in a draw this week, with that chance rated at 29.6%. Everton have drawn their last two Premier League matches at home, while under-pressure Palace boss Roy Hodgson has never won a top-flight match at Goodison Park in 10 attempts with five different clubs, losing eight and drawing two of his 10 games there.

In late January, Barcelona travelled to Bilbao to take on Athletic Club at San Mamés in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. As Wednesday night edged closer to the early hours of Thursday morning and extra time beckoned, one thing became apparent: Barcelona had no chance. As the minutes ticked by, muscles grew more fatigued and the game opened up, it felt like Athletic Club were building towards a crescendo. They were playing with a 12th man, every attack roared on by a goal-thirsty Bilbao crowd, who seemed immune to fatigue. Two daggers straight to Barcelona’s heart in extra time, one by each of the Williams brothers, put Barcelona out of their misery as their legs turned into dust and their hopes of Copa glory evaporated. The hosts finished that game with 29 shots and seven on target to Barcelona’s seven total shots and four on target. Athletic Club almost tripled Barcelona’s expected goals (xG) total on the night in the process of running them off the field. This is the story of Athletic Club in 2023-24. Combative, relentless and ruthless. San Mamés has become a fortress and they’re eyeing a return to the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 2014-15 when, no surprise, Ernesto Valverde was the man in the dugout. Athletic Bilbao’s Basque-only policy means they are heavily reliant on the players their Lezama academy produces. It means when fallow years arrive, which inevitably they do, the club can’t sign their way out of the abyss. It also means that when a special crop of players break through, there’s a feeling of euphoria. It’s not just ‘we’re winning’, it’s ‘we’re winning with homegrown talent’. Add in a manager who inherently understands the club and the place, and it feels like a wave of momentum that cannot be stopped. Athletic Bilbao currently have a special crop of players. Oihan Sancet, Unai Simón and Nico Williams are all Spain internationals. They have another few who are knocking on the door and more still just breaking through at the club. Luis de la Fuente has asked his Spain team to play a more vertical style and football in the north is providing just that. At a time when Basque managers are making headlines from Birmingham to Bournemouth and Bayer Leverkusen, Athletic Club and Real Sociedad are providing the backbone of the Spanish national team. Along with the players mentioned above, Real Sociedad have also recently sent Álex Remiro, Robin Le Normand, Mikel Merino and Martín Zubimendi. They’re not the kind of players you think of when you conjure up images of Spain’s golden era between 2008 to 2012. These are todoterreno type players — a term used in Spanish to reference all-rounders but which also implies a physical edge to their game.  Athletic Bilbao are built on this principle. They are a team filled with young, physical, technically excellent players with a manager who appreciates the nuance within each player and position. Their home form is where they’ve really made their mark this season. Athletic Club have won eight consecutive games across all competitions at San Mamés, their longest winning streak at home since September 1998 (also eight straight wins). Only Real Madrid have a higher share of xG in home games this season. Athletic have racked up 26.15 expected goals and 10.18 expected goals against, with their attacking output accounting for 72.0% of the total share. Real Madrid currently sit at 75.7% at the Santiago Bernabéu with Atlético Madrid in third with 68.7% at the Metropolitano. To understand Athletic’s strength, you have to take a holistic approach. There is no stand-out superstar but a good place to start is their backline. The pressure higher up the field is a factor that makes them an intimidating proposition for any team in the world and it’s impossible to disentangle the two, but improved attacking efficiency and an ability to press is built on the fact that they have a rock solid centre-back partnership. Aitor Paredes and Dani Vivian are both under 25 and have played the highest share of minutes individually across the league and cup for Athletic this season. Together, they have played 1,593 minutes this season, the most in La Liga for any centre-back partnership. They also have the best expected goals against per 90 together for centre-back pairing with 500+ mins played (1.07). The only other partnership with a higher winning percentage among those with more than 500 minutes played together is Antonio Rüdiger and David Alaba. Paredes and Vivian have won 57.8% of games they have started together (19 starts, 11 wins), while the Real Madrid pair have won 66.6% of games they have started (12 starts, 8 wins). Valverde’s side are the most aggressive team in the league in terms of trying to win the ball back high up the field and they do that knowing their two centre-backs have things covered if a team plays through them or over the top. They’ve recorded the most high turnovers in Spain’s top flight with 251; Sevilla are a long way behind in second with 217, while Athletic have turned their high turnovers into more goals (6) than any other team in the division. They start their attacks, on average, higher than any other team in La Liga and have more defensive actions than any team in Spain’s top flight too. But it’s not just a kick-and-rush approach. There is an added layer of nuance to their game that has been facilitated by some savvy recruitment and the emergence of players who were already at the club. One such signing is that of Íñigo Ruiz de Galarreta from Mallorca. If you were to make a list of the 100 most exciting transfers last summer, Ruiz de Galarreta to Athletic Bilbao on a free transfer might not even be considered a shortlist candidate. A 30-year-old midfielder, Ruiz de Galarreta was born in Eibar and has played for clubs like Barcelona’s second team and Las Palmas during his career, two clubs known for their desire to hold on to the ball. He has added a level of control to a side that has often struggled to find more balanced midfielders. Ander Herrera might be the best comparison but he turns 35 this year and can’t play the same amount of minutes as he once could. Ruiz de Galarreta is on the more technical side of the todoterrano scale but he isn’t shy either out of possession. On average, he’s winning 5.7 duels per 90, behind only Herrera for Athletic midfielders with over 1,000 minutes played this season. Ruiz de Galarreta’s influence can be seen best in Athletic Club’s results with him on the field. They’ve lost as many games when he’s not started in La Liga this season (2/7) as they have in the 17 games he’s been in the starting XI. The emergence of Sancet as a Spain international and one of the best attacking midfielders in the league has gone a long way to fixing what, for years, felt like a broken attack. As part of The Analyst 50, we wrote about Sancet being primed for a breakout year. He has been central to Athletic Club’s revitalised attack. He has 0.41 non-penalty xG and assists per 90 this season, which is fourth among Athletic players with at least 1,000 minutes. But his footprint is everywhere in the team’s attack. Only nine players have more attacking sequence involvements this season in La Liga and he’s also creating 2.14 chances from open play, behind only Iago Aspas in La Liga this term.  The final piece of the puzzle has been the emergence of Gorka Guruzeta. At 27, without ever making an impact at the club where he began his career, it felt like Guruzeta’s opportunity had passed. There’s an argument now that Luis de la Fuente needs a player like Guruzeta in his Spain side. Guruzeta leads the team in non-penalty xG per 90 with 0.47. He has already played more minutes this season in La Liga than in any other season in his career. He has scored three more goals this season (9) than his previous best of six in the top flight, which he managed in 2022-23. He features among the top of most defensive metrics for forwards and he links play like a Basque Karim Benzema. Sancet and Guruzeta are the final pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that for years never seemed finished. Sancet plays as a traditional 10 as part of Valverde’s preferred 4-2-3-1 and Guruzeta spearheads the attack. That allows the Williams brothers, Nico on the left and Iñaki on the right, to play in their best positions. Iñaki has played 96% of his minutes in the league on the right this season. Last year, that number was just 42% with him spending 54% of his minutes as the number nine.  He is currently on pace to beat his best goalscoring season ever (13 in La Liga in 2018-19) and both he and his brother can stretch teams vertically and horizontally on either side with Ruiz de Galarreta, Sancet and Guruzeta operating in the open spaces, ready to pounce with purpose if they lose the ball. Iñaki Williams’ current position accentuates his best traits and masks some of the deficiencies we have seen over the years, namely high-volume efficient finishing. Nico Williams is on the fast-track to superstardom with nary a dribbling or take-on metric that he isn’t among the top three of in La Liga this season. His 56 successful take-ons rank 8th among all players across Europe’s top five leagues and he is completing 3.35 dribbles per 90, behind only Vinícius Júnior in La Liga this season. Last Wednesday in the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg, Athletic became the first away side to keep a clean sheet (and win) at the Metropolitano in over a year. Atlético had scored 73 goals in the 28 games between those. They are 90 minutes away from the Copa del Rey final and just two points behind Atlético in fourth place in the league too. They welcome Girona to their fortress on Monday night with a return date against Atlético in the Copa semis on the horizon too. This season could turn into something special for Athletic Club.

We look ahead to Sunday’s Premier League clash with our Luton Town vs Manchester United preview and prediction. Manchester United will be hoping to add further fuel to their slow-starting top-four challenge in the Premier League when they visit Luton Town, who begin a testing three-game run in their relegation battle on Sunday at Kenilworth Road. Erik ten Hag’s side boosted their unlikely UEFA Champions League qualification hopes with Sunday’s 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, moving within five points of Unai Emery’s side and six behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the league table after Scott McTominay’s late winner on Matchday 24. Douglas Luiz had earlier crashed in a second-half leveller at Villa Park to cancel out the 17th-minute opener from Rasmus Højlund, who could become the youngest player to score in six Premier League games in a row if he nets against Luton, surpassing Newcastle United’s Joe Willock (aged 21 years and 272 days). McTominay has scored seven Premier League goals this season, more than any United teammate, while four of those have been as a substitute, the joint-most by any player in the division in 2023-24 (level with Brighton’s João Pedro). The Man Utd midfielder’s league goals this term have been worth 12 points, the most of any player for any team this season. He has only found the net in five games this campaign, but in three of those his finish has been the winner. Having recorded three straight victories over Wolves, West Ham and Villa – alongside the January draw with Tottenham – there is a quiet optimism surrounding the Old Trafford side, who have battled through injury issues to reignite their top-four hopes. Anthony Martial, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia are the long-term absentees from Ten Hag’s lineup. Luke Shaw also limped off at half-time in their MD 24 victory but could return for Sunday’s kick-off, while Sofyan Amrabat played for the first time against Villa since coming back from the Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco. Mason Mount is back in first-team training, too, though it remains unclear on the diagnosis and timeframe of Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s absence. As for the hosts, Luton appeared to be trending upwards in their relegation battle, drawing with Burnley and Newcastle United either side of a 4-0 thrashing against Brighton, but suffered a 3-1 disappointment at home to fellow strugglers Sheffield United on MD 24. Rob Edwards’ men are still a point clear of 18th-placed Everton, who have played a game more, heading into the weekend’s fixtures. Cameron Archer, James McAtee and Vinicius Souza were all on target for the victorious Blades last Saturday, with Carlton Morris’ second-half penalty a mere consolation at Kenilworth Road. The Luton striker has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other teammate this season (six goals, four assists), with four of his goals coming from the penalty spot. He’s the first English player to score four penalties in his debut campaign in the competition since Watford’s Troy Deeney in 2015-16 (six). There has seemingly been a change in mindset for Edwards’ side as well, with Luton averaging 15.1 shots per game across their last seven Premier League matches, in comparison to the 10.3 shots they averaged in their first 16 outings. The Hatters have also had 5.9 shots on target per game in those seven games, a big increase on the 2.6 per game they had in their first 16. Somewhat surprisingly, only Tottenham (36) are on a longer scoring run in Premier League matches among current teams than Luton (11). However, last season’s Championship play-off winners have ended on the losing side in five of those games (W4 D2), against Sheff Utd, Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Brentford. That free-scoring run will at least have Luton supporters encouraged for what will prove to be a tough upcoming schedule as they host Man Utd on Sunday before visiting Premier League title contenders Liverpool and hosting top-four chasing Aston Villa, alongside an FA Cup fifth-round clash with Man City. As for Luton’s team news, Edwards’ options largely remain the same: Tom Lockyer, Daiki Hashioka, Mads Andersen and Marvelous Nakamba remain sidelined. Ross Barkley, Morris and Elijah Adebayo will likely be the attacking trio that Ten Hag has to watch out for at the weekend. Luton have lost nine of their last 10 league games against Manchester United, with the exception being a 1-1 draw the last time they faced them at Kenilworth Road (April 1992) – their most recent clash saw Victor Lindelöf score the winner in a 1-0 triumph at Old Trafford back in November. Indeed, Man Utd are unbeaten in their last 12 meetings with Luton in all competitions (W10 D2), since a 2-1 loss at Kenilworth Road some time ago in March 1987. Continue to look away Luton fans! The Red Devils have won their last 11 Premier League matches against newly promoted clubs, only conceding five goals in this run. It’s their best winning run against promoted sides since a 12-match run between 2011 and 2013 under Alex Ferguson. Ten Hag has also won all nine of his Premier League games against newly promoted clubs, the best 100% win ratio against those sides of any manager in the competition’s history. The only two managers to win their first 10 games against promoted clubs in the competition are José Mourinho (first 15) and Roberto Mancini (first 12). Ten Hag’s side have found comfort away from Old Trafford, with only Manchester City (eight) and Arsenal (seven) winning more Premier League away games this season than United’s six heading into this weekend’s top-flight schedule. To start the new year, Man Utd have won their last four away games in all competitions – beating Villa and Wolves as well as FA Cup victories over Newport County and Wigan Athletic – which marks their longest such run on the road since winning 10 in a row from June to October 2020. Overall across all competitions, United have won five of their last six games, including their last four in a row. Ten Hag’s men last had a longer winning run between November 2022 and January 2023 (nine in a row). Luton, meanwhile, have managed three wins in their last seven Premier League games – two more than they recorded in their opening 16 matches this term. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Man Utd are seen as the favourites by the Opta supercomputer, winning 46.5% of 10,000 pre-match simulations at Kenilworth Road. Luton may need a response in their battle from the drop but recorded that much-needed victory in 26.5%, with the draw more likely in 27.0% of the data-led scenarios. A trio of United victories has lifted their top-four chances to 6.5% in Opta’s end-of-season simulations, though their current sixth-place standing remains their most likely league-table finish (34.7%). Meanwhile, Luton were relegated in 47.3% of scenarios – that is a more promising likelihood than Sheffield United (97.4%) and Burnley (95.4%) but just behind Nottingham Forest (29.5%) and Everton (17.7%).

Richarlison is in the form of his life. A run of nine goals in eight Premier League games that started in December and ran through the period in which Tottenham had to make do without star man Son Heung-min – who was away at the Asian Cup – signalled his best ever run of form in England. There have been a fair few obstacles to success since he moved to Spurs, not least the immovable presence of Harry Kane up front in the starting lineup last season – Richarlison’s first at the club. Then, earlier this season, he admitted to struggling with his mental health for an extended period. “I’ve been suffering,” he said in November. “Fighting for my national team and my club for eight months and haven’t been taking care of myself. I think it’s time to rest, to stop for a second.” He would have a break from the game to “seek psychological help,” and took the opportunity to undergo an operation on an ongoing pelvis issue. The Brazilian then sat out for just over a month, but returned in December with a bang. Two goals against Newcastle in his first start back sparked this fine run of form, and he has looked a different player since. However, a blank from Richarlison in a stop-start Spurs display against Brighton at the weekend has reopened the debate around Totteham’s number nine. There are plenty of people who remain unconvinced by the Brazilian; people who don’t believe that this run of form – the only run resembling anything like a purple patch in his Spurs career – proves he is the long-term answer up front. Those same fans are once again wondering whether Richarlison is good enough to lead the line for a team likely to be playing Champions League football next season, and that is desperate to end a trophy drought that now stretches to 16 years. It seems harsh to judge a player on that one game when he’s been scoring for fun of late. In fact, even after failing to score against Brighton, he has scored at least two more goals since the start of December than any other player in the whole Premier League (nine). But he has never before had a better Premier League run than four goals in four games, and many other players before him have hit as many as nine in eight only to fall by the wayside. The signs are positive, but it remains to be seen if Richarlison has turned a corner with his goalscoring now.    He isn’t the most technically gifted or aesthetically pleasing footballer the Premier League has ever seen, so some people find him difficult to watch. That same issue leads some to wonder what it is he brings to the team if he isn’t scoring goals.\\xa0 That problem has been exaggerated playing in an Ange Postecoglou team. Postecoglou wants his team to dominate the ball, but the centre-forward’s job is rather more limited than for other managers. At Celtic, Kyogo Furuhashi averaged just 5.4 touches per shot and 17.7 touches per goal in 2022-23, Postecoglou’s second and final season at Celtic. Both were by a distance the lowest in the Scottish Premiership by any player across the Australian’s two years in charge. He of course did more than just shoot and score, but Furuhashi’s primary focus was to threaten the opposition’s goal, and for long periods he would be distinctly uninvolved. For Spurs fans accustomed to having all-rounder Harry Kane up front, it’s been quite the change. Over the past couple of months, Richarlison has appeared to come to terms better with Ange-Ball. He knows now when and where to make runs to meet balls across the penalty area, and the goals have flowed as a result. They are exactly the kinds of chances that Postecoglou wants his teams to create – getting in down the flanks and playing a ball across the face of goal – and Richarlison has been doing the most important job in the team exceptionally of late. He has looked something like the perfect striker for Postecoglou’s football – should we really be asking much more of him? It wasn’t always this way, though. Richarlison had spent much of the early part of Postecoglou’s reign playing off the left or coming off the bench to replace Son up front, and a recent consistent run of games as Tottenham’s number nine has benefitted him. He has got into dangerous positions more consistently and goals have bred confidence, as is shown by his record in front of goal either side of 8 December: one goal from 3.0 expected goals before; nine goals from 5.2 xG since.  Since coming back into the starting XI in early December, Richarlison has scored with all but one of the nine shots he has had closest to goal. He is getting into better positions more often and finishing chances more effectively too.  His rising confidence was such that against Everton he scored a Premier League goal from outside the penalty area for the first time in more than three years. Richarlison's second goal today against Everton was only his third Premier League goal from outside the penalty area, and his first since December 2020 (for Everton vs Leicester) #EVETOT pic.twitter.com/Z6UTUv3uxB His hold-up and link play are improving, and for a team that has as much of the ball as Tottenham (averaging 59.8% possession), he is always going to have to do more than just finish off chances. But even though he has played 20% of his Premier League minutes this season on the left flank, Richarlison ranks third in the Premier League for the number of times his only involvement in an open play shot-ending sequence is having the shot (1,000+ minutes), with 3.1 such shots per 90. The two players he is behind are Darwin Núñez (3.7) and Erling Haaland (3.2). Richarlison has had 53 shots in Premier League games this season, and 44 of them (83.0%) have been in open play with him having no other involvement in the sequence. He is of course sometimes involved in sequences without having the shot – as was the case in the build-up to Brennan Johnson’s winner against Brighton at the weekend – but more often than not, he is on the end of chances without otherwise touching the ball. His off-the-ball work and movement is, however, an important part of his game. He works extremely hard, ranking third in the Premier League in 2023-24 for pressures in the final third per 90 (min 1,000 minutes), with 21.5, behind only Rasmus Højlund 23.2 and Dominic Calvert-Lewin 23.0, and he also drags defenders out of position to create space for others – namely the wide forwards who get in behind so frequently. This is the kind of work that will go unnoticed and underappreciated. It’s more than just trying hard – something that nobody could ever accuse Richarlison of not doing. It is smart running, clever timing of slow-then-fast movements, and intelligent pressing. Spurs have won the ball within 40m of their opponents’ goalline more times this season (249) than any other Premier League team, and only three teams have scored more goals from such situations than them (six). Richarlison more than plays his part in Tottenham’s out-of-possession game. But while Richarlison has done a better job than many had expected or possibly even hoped he would this season, there are still moments when Spurs are left longing for a more clinical finisher.  On Saturday, he was put clean through on the Brighton goal by James Maddison in the 22nd minute with Spurs 1-0 down but, after taking a touch that left the ball slightly under his feet, struck his effort straight at goalkeeper Jason Steele. There were a couple of back-post chances from crosses that he put wide against West Ham and Luton when he might well have done better. There was the ball that sat up perfectly for him inside the box against Bournemouth from which he failed to find a corner of the goal. In clutch moments, it’s not entirely clear that he is the ruthless goalscorer that a team yearning for a first Premier League title might need.  Back in September, Richarlison came off the bench at Arsenal and had three chances in second-half injury time with the game finely poised at 2-2. For the first, he received a pass from Dejan Kulusevski in the box, and turned and struck the ball against the feet of William Saliba. He was slightly lacking in match sharpness and was up against an excellent defender, but watching that sequence back, it is stark how swiftly a promising position came to nothing. For the third of those chances, in the 100th minute, he received a cut-back from Kulusevski but his effort was side-footed meekly wide of the target. In those big moments, or when he has to be a bit creative or imaginative with finding a route to goal, he can leave a lot to be desired. All but one of his 10 goals this season have been first-time finishes, the exception being his two-touch goal against Newcastle when he took down Pedro Porro’s long ball and slotted past Martin Dúbravka to score. The problem for Richarlison is that breathing down his neck at Tottenham is one of the best attackers in the world and one of the best players in the club’s recent history. Son, the team’s captain, is clearly a better player and better finisher than Richarlison, and he has shown this season what he can do when he plays through the middle. Earlier in the season, Son enjoyed a fine run of goalscoring form up front. In 2023-24 so far, he has scored 11 goals from 36 shots while playing up front, compared to two goals from 16 shots when out wide. Postecoglou has decided, however, that the team benefits most overall from Son playing on the left and Richarlison playing through the middle. In Premier League games this season, Richarlison has 10 goals from 42 shots playing up front, compared to zero goals from 11 shots when on the left.  Some fans will wonder what might have happened were it Son bearing down on the Brighton goal last weekend, or if the South Korean had met Kulusevski’s cut-back at the death at the Emirates. Maybe it’s unfair to compare Richarlison to Son. Son is a genuine world-class forward, and Spurs have gained a great deal from having him out wide – not least his ball-carrying ability and creativity, both of which came in very handy for Johnson’s winner at the weekend. Richarlison will never be Son, and he is doing an admirable job up front for Spurs in a system he hasn’t had long to learn. After all, he wasn’t a Postecoglou signing, and the current manager has got far more from him than Antonio Conte, who was in charge when Richarlison was signed for the not-insignificant amount of £60m.   That fee might well mean the Brazilian always faces a level of scrutiny that few others do, while Son’s presence may mean Spurs fans hold everyone else to unfair standards. Richarlison is therefore up against a lot, but as we have seen, he is one for overcoming adversity, and he’ll believe in his ability to be the centre-forward Tottenham need if they are to take the step up to challenging the Premier League elite. Even if he does, the doubters will still take some convincing.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Free-kicks have provided some truly iconic goals and nearly every football fan will have at least one particularly memorable effort that sticks out in their mind. They stand out because of the sheer technical ability – or extreme power – involved. It’s all well and good getting the ball beyond a wall of players, but to then also have the velocity and accuracy to beat a high-quality goalkeeper? Well, that’s another matter entirely. Some players just seem to have the Midas touch in such situations. For many, David Beckham has been the standard bearer among free-kick takers in the modern era, but there are plenty of other names that ‘the streets won’t forget’. Shunsuke Nakamura and Juninho Pernambucano had incredible reputations for scoring from direct free-kicks; Lionel Messi made the skill a key part of his repertoire; even Cristiano Ronaldo scored lots despite also hitting walls with the regularity of a squash player. But if it seems like free-kick specialists are dying breed, it’s because they sort of are. James Ward-Prowse feels like one of the last players that fans of opposing teams genuinely fear when standing over a deal ball within 30 yards of the goal. It being a dying art only makes us at Opta Analyst more interested in the numbers behind the free-kicks, though, so we’ve trawled through all the relevant Opta data (from the start of 2006-07) for the top five European leagues to bring you the definitive guide to free-kick takers. Spoiler alert, it’s not really going to be possible to conclusively prove who the best free-kick taker was over our identified period because it kind of depends on how you determine that and where you draw the line (or spray the foam, if you will). So, you’ll have to make your own conclusions there… We did promise to provide the stats, though, and we’ll follow through on that at least. It probably won’t come as a huge surprise to learn that over the 17-season period in question, Cristiano Ronaldo (492) and Lionel Messi (456) attempted the most direct free-kick shots. After all, they consistently played for some of the biggest clubs and they were at that level for the vast majority of the time we’re looking at, so clearly they’ve a few advantages there. Nevertheless, it’s a pretty huge gap to the rest; Zlatan Ibrahimovic (235) and Andrea Pirlo (227) are the only other two players to break the 200 barrier. So, with that in mind, Messi (41) and Ronaldo (31) leading the way with the most goals also shouldn’t come as a shock as they’d registered way more attempts than everyone else. By that logic, you also won’t be surprised to learn who holds the record for direct free-kick goals in the Champions League… But how do those goal figures look when considered as a percentage of their total free-kick shots? This of course is where we get a better idea of a player’s efficiency from free-kicks, considering the frequency at which they score from them. Ronaldo scored 6.3% of his free-kicks in the top five European leagues, roughly one in every 16, while Messi was up at 9%, approximately one in 11. When looking at the rest, we have to filter out players who’ve only taken a few; for argument’s sake, we put the cut-off at 30 free-kick shots as that’s enough to draw up a list of players who at least took set-pieces on a semi-regular basis for more than just a season. Of the remaining 391 players, the best conversion rate belonged to Diego, the former Brazil midfielder who played for Werder Bremen, Juventus, Wolfsburg and Atlético Madrid during the period in question. For those clubs, he took 84 free-kick shots and scored 13 of them for a conversion rate of 15.5%. That puts him slightly ahead of former Paris Saint-Germain full-back Siaka Tiéné (15.2%), though the Ivorian’s five goals came from 33 attempts, less than half of Diego’s total, further highlighting the dead-ball quality of the Brazilian. Essentially, for every six free-kick shots he attempted, Diego scored a goal. Similarly, Ward-Prowse’s ability to maintain a high success rate over an even larger number of free-kicks reflects well on him. He’s attempted 128 in the Premier League and scored 17. That’s a conversion rate of 13.3%, putting him 10th among those to have taken at least 30 shots over the period in question, though only one other player in the top 30 for conversion rate took over 100 shots, and of those above him just Juan Mata (9/60, 15%) and Diego recorded more than 47 attempts.  In total, only six players have managed more than a 10% conversion rate from 100+ free-kick shots, including Ronaldinho (11/107, 10.3%) – so, while we aren’t going to say this player or that player was the best at free-kicks, Ward-Prowse’s record holds up incredibly well. He boasts an efficiency most players could only dream of, and then there’s a few who’d have been happy to just score one… That’s right, we ought to also shine a light on those with – how to put this politely? – an admirable, albeit questionable, self-confidence from free-kicks. Two stand out here: Pascal Berenguer attempted 112 shots from free-kicks for Nancy without scoring any after the start of 2006-07, while Christian Romaric (109) endured similar profligacy for a handful of clubs in France and Spain. Of course, looking at totals over such a long period potentially causes us to miss interesting outputs over shorter spans, so we’ve also crunched the numbers on a season-by-season basis as well. It’s fair to say this chucks out a few names who are blasts from the past, with the majority of the players to tally the most free-kick attempts in a single season long since retired. This reflects a few trends that we’ll come to in a bit, but first we need to dedicate some attention to the aforementioned Juninho, a bona-fide icon of kicking the ball really hard from just about anywhere. To say the former Lyon star was persistent would be an understatement; his 70 free-kick shots in the 2006-07 Ligue 1 season is by far the most recorded in a single season. He also ranks second (60 in 2007-08) and fourth (53 in 2008-09); there was no angle too acute and no distance too great. Across those three seasons, he managed 11 goals, with five of those coming in 2008-09. The only other players to get within 20 of Juninho’s video game-esque tally of 70 attempts in 2006-07 were Cristiano Ronaldo (55 in 2011-12, 53 in 2010-11 and 50 in 2008-09) and Juan Arango (50 in 2008-09), the talented Venezuelan dead-ball specialist who made a significant impact at Real Mallorca and Borussia Mönchengladbach. None of those mentioned managed to top our charts for the most free-kick goals scored in a single season on record, though. That figure is six, and three players managed to achieve that total in one campaign – one of them doing so twice. Messi tucked six away in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons, with his 14.6% conversion rate in the latter his best record in a league campaign (minimum seven attempts), while Ronaldinho and Hakan Çalhanoglu also reached that total in 2006-07 and 2014-15 respectively. Yaya Touré is worthy of a particularly special mention, though. During his almost legendary 2013-14 season at Manchester City, he boasted an incredible efficiency from free-kicks, scoring four of a possible seven. That 57.1% conversion rate has been bettered by only one other player to register at least five attempts in a single season; Gabriel Boschilia scored three of his five free-kick shots for Monaco in the 2016-17 campaign (60%). Now we go from one extreme to the other. Over our designated timespan, there have been six instances of players attempting 30 or more free-kick shots without getting a single goal – unsurprisingly the aforementioned Berenguer (33 in 2008-09) and Romaric (36 in 2006-07) are both among them with Alessio Cerci (32 in 2013-14), Arango (34 in 2009-10), Marcos Assunção (34 in 2006-07) and, the holder of this particular unwanted record, Fabrizio Miccoli (38 in 2009-10). Make no mistake, the prominence of shots direct from free-kicks has changed dramatically over the past 18 years or so. In the 2006-07 season, there was an average of 642 shots taken from free-kicks across the top five leagues, and that figure is skewed slightly by the fact the Bundesliga has fewer matches. Two years later, the average was 100 higher, with 742 the median across these competitions. Last season, however, the average for the five leagues was 305 free-kick shots over the full season, with Serie A recording the most (340). As such, there were only 87 free-kick goals scored in those leagues combined, which is less than half of the 183 we saw across the same competitions in the 2008-09 campaign, for instance. Although isolated figures, these are indicative of the general decline in the frequency free-kick shots since 2006. In fact, we even saw the first instance (well, on record!) of a league failing to even reach double digits for free-kick goals in 2021-22, as just nine were scored in La Liga – suffice to say, that conversion rate of 2.8% is also the worst on record. The 2008-09 campaign is also the point at which we have the data to look at things in a little more detail, specifically highlighting free-kicks in the final third (i.e. those that are more likely to be in shooting range); there were 7.8 per game across the top five leagues that campaign, and 1.9 of those were shots. That works out at roughly 25% over those competitions. Last season, however, those averages were at 4.4 and 0.9, the lowest on record, having steadily dropped pretty much every year since 2008. That means only 18.8% of free-kicks in the final third were recorded as shots in 2022-23 compared to 24.6% in 2008-09 despite the median distance to goal decreasing to 27.6 metres from 29.5m over these years. It seems fair to suggest VAR has had an impact. Each league’s record low for free-kick shots has been registered since the technology was introduced (for 2017-18 in the Bundesliga and Serie A, 2018-19 in La Liga and Ligue 1, 2019-20 in the Premier League). Fouls generally decreasing has contributed to this, which itself is partly down to referees having the added backup of VAR (make up your own mind on whether that’s a good thing or not!). Officials also exercise greater leniency these days, showing more willingness to let play go on for marginal calls, with the graphic below highlighting a reduction in fouls given in the final third as far as Opta records go back. But we can’t just point to VAR and referees. Between 2008-09 and 2015-16, there was a decline in the average number of free-kick shots per league every season. Then it went up ever so slightly to 448 from 445, but since then it’s continued to decrease year on year, without exception. The gradual decrease started way before VAR was introduced. Another possible explanation lies in the increased trust in data analytics, and metrics such as expected goals (xG); it could be argued teams are putting greater thought into their choices around free-kicks, concluding their scoring probability might be higher if they play crosses into the danger area as opposed to going for goal from distance. Considering the money involved in modern football and the potential value of any marginal gain, maybe it’s understandable such goals are nowhere near as prevalent as they were not so long ago. But at the same time, maybe it’s all just part of a cycle? Perhaps we’ll become so used to free-kicks not being sent straight towards goal that defensive tactics – or the personnel themselves – improve to counter the threat. As such, maybe a new trend will emerge as a result that sees greater emphasis on shooting whenever the opportunity arises. As long as we still have a few free-kick conservationists left like Ward-Prowse, this endangered species will hopefully endure. Enjoy this?

Newcastle United fans traditionally ask for three things from their players: giving everything for the club, being very good at football, and unconditional loyalty. Granted, those are three highly sought-after qualities generally throughout the game, but Newcastle appear to have all three in the form of their latest hero, Bruno Guimarães. The Brazilian’s importance to Eddie Howe’s side was on show again at the City Ground on Saturday as his two goals helped them to a hard-fought 3-2 win against Nottingham Forest. The first goal was a sublime first-time volleyed finish with his laces after a clever run to the far post, while the second was an accurate low shot into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area. Both showed off Guimarães’ excellent technique, but goals aren’t usually where he thrives. They were, after all, just his second and third of the season in 34 appearances in all competitions. Guimarães has been Newcastle’s all-rounder since he arrived in January 2022; their engine, their heart and their skill rolled into one. His arrival from Lyon for a reported fee of £40 million was one of the first purchases under the new Saudi ownership, and Guimarães quickly set about proving he could take Newcastle to the next level. After a promising first half-season, he pushed on and was a crucial part of the team that reached the EFL Cup final and finished in the top four of the Premier League in 2022-23. Howe’s side were considered to be ahead of schedule, and in no small part thanks to the performances of their tenacious and talented midfielder. The tricky part is always the so-called ‘difficult second album’. Could Newcastle go again? Repeat the trick, or even improve on it? So far, the answer is no. Newcastle are seventh in the Premier League after 24 games and have already lost twice as many league games (10) as they did in the whole of last season (5). They have also conceded six more goals (39) than in the entirety of their 2022-23 Premier League campaign (33). However, that doesn’t mean Guimarães has allowed his own performances to dip. In the Premier League in 2022-23, he averaged 53.7 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy of 84.6%. That has increased to 62.5 passes per 90 and accuracy of 86.6% this season. His creativity is basically identical, creating 1.38 chances per 90 last season and 1.42 this, while his tackles per 90 is slightly down from 2.6 per 90 to 2.3. His goals and assists output in the Premier League is remarkably similar, averaging 0.13 goals per 90 this season, exactly the same as in 2022-23, while assists per 90 are ever so slightly up from 0.16 to 0.18. Diving deeper into Guimarães’ numbers, he’s covering the second-furthest distance per 90 (10.36km) of any Newcastle player this season (behind only Sean Longstaff – 10.76km). That is the 19th highest in the Premier League of those to have played at least 1,500 minutes (including added time). He is also facing the most pressures in England’s top flight this season – a defensive action in which a player whose team is out of possession moves to close down an opposing player in possession. Guimarães leads the Premier League for being pressured while in possession (807) ahead of Manchester City’s Rodri (793), and significantly ahead of Aston Villa’s Ezri Konsa in third place (579). Rodri is perhaps slightly better under pressure, losing the ball to a turnover just 4.8% of the time, whereas Guimarães has lost possession to a turnover from a press on 9.7% of occasions, but it could be argued that the City man gets better movement from his teammates to allow him out of those situations. It should also be pointed out that a much larger proportion of occasions when Guimarães has been pressured have been counter-pressures (28.4% compared to Rodri’s 19.5%). A counter pressure is when a pressure begins within two seconds of the start of possession, so the situations are generally more chaotic. As you can see from his heat maps below, Guimarães has had more touches in deeper midfield areas for Newcastle this season compared to last season, which means he’s had more of the ball but often in less dangerous parts of the pitch.  Guimarães said himself after the Nottingham Forest win that he enjoys getting further up the field but is often asked to sit deeper. Perhaps that wouldn’t have been the case if Sandro Tonali had been able to play more following his signing from Milan last summer. It is perhaps no surprise that Guimarães leads the way for Newcastle in terms of attacking sequence involvements too, with 113 in total in the Premier League, split between 27 shots, 28 chances created and 58 involvements in the build up to a shot. Last season he was second for his side (139) just behind Kieran Trippier (141), though from 600 fewer minutes played. You also have the juggling of competitions. Last season, Newcastle weren’t in Europe. This season, they had a UEFA Champions League campaign, and what a hand they were dealt. Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund awaited them in the group stage, but after a difficult goalless draw in Italy, Newcastle put Europe on notice. Their 4-1 thrashing of PSG at St James’ Park was a statement performance, with Guimarães at the centre of it. As well as recording an assist for Dan Burn, he created two chances, totalled the most passes for Newcastle (35) as well as passes completed (25), won five of his eight duels (62.5%), won three fouls and won possession 14 times, more than anyone else on the pitch. Sadly for Newcastle, that was where things peaked. They lost home and away to Dortmund before a draw in Paris was followed by a home defeat to Milan and elimination from Europe entirely. It perhaps wasn’t too much of a shock, but it also seemed a shame that someone as good as Guimarães was now out of the Champions League. It may not have been a classic campaign, but during the UCL group stage, only Galatasaray’s Lucas Torreira (61), Benfica’s João Neves (50) and Feyenoord’s Mats Wieffer (50) made more recoveries than Guimarães (49) aming midfielders. It was not the first time he has played in the competition, though. Guimarães also featured in four Champions League games for Lyon in 2019-20, including an impressive 3-1 win over Manchester City in the quarter-finals, making as many tackles as anyone in the game (three) despite only playing 70 minutes and winning five of his eight duels. As things stand, it seems unlikely Guimarães and Newcastle will be competing in next season’s Champions League, despite the likelihood that the Premier League will have a fifth seat at the table. Their form has recently improved, though. After losing six from seven Premier League games prior to their recent 3-1 win at Aston Villa, Newcastle have won two and drawn one of their last three. They’re now up to seventh in the table but still 10 points off fifth place, and 11 off fourth and a guaranteed Champions League spot. The Opta supercomputer says they have less than a 10% chance of a top-five finish, and their likeliest final position is their current one of seventh, which would probably mean participation in the UEFA Europa Conference League next season. Is that enough for someone like Guimarães, now 26 and reportedly being courted by some of Europe’s elite clubs? It very well might be. After the win at Forest, he spoke again of his love for the club and reiterated his desire to “keep going for much longer”. He told Sky Sports: “Sometimes people speak a lot about me. I just speak a lot about football. I’m very happy here, and I like how the fans think of me here. “I enjoy my time here a lot. I have never felt so loved. The fans have been unbelievable with me and my family. When I get the shirt, I try to play for them. I don’t know [how long I’ll be at the club], but I hope this can keep going for much longer.” Stories have swirled in recent times about Newcastle needing to sell one of their star players in order to spend more in the summer due to the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules. Although this has been denied by the club, it’s not stopped talk of Guimarães being in demand, with Paris Saint-Germain credited with a serious interest in January. A player of his quality will invariably be linked with other clubs, but that’s not to say he’ll go. Even if he does, you’d back Newcastle to find a replacement the same way they found him. Our Opta Player Radars show Guimarães profiles most similarly this season with PSG’s Fabián Ruiz, Inter’s Nicolò Barella and Chelsea’s Conor Gallagher among others, all players Newcastle have been linked with in the past. For now, though, Guimarães seems to be very happy on Tyneside where he continues to have a positive influence and is increasing the adoration from the fanbase on a weekly basis. Champions League or not, maybe that’s enough. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We analysed their output to see just how good they are. Mikel Arteta has done a stellar job at Arsenal, transforming them into a side with legitimate aspirations for success. They’re also one of the most entertaining teams around, blessed with serious attacking talent that make them dynamic when on the front foot but also difficult to play against when not in possession. However, they’re arguably quite unconventional for a ‘pretty’ side. Yes, they play entertaining football, but also being an absolute nightmare to defend against at set-pieces isn’t necessarily something you associate with those sides who like to get the ball down and play. No, there’s almost a hint of snobbery involved in how some may have perceived the use of set-pieces over the years, like lumping a high ball into the box for a big bloke to head in is somehow beneath certain teams and instead the realm of ‘route-one’ types. But obviously that’s nonsense. Any route to goal is legitimate – so long as it’s, well, legitimate – and Arsenal are the proof in the pudding that you can be both pretty and robust, with their effectiveness at attacking set-pieces simply unrivalled in the Premier League at the moment. West Ham were the latest team to fall victim to Arsenal’s set-piece excellence on Sunday. It was a one-sided encounter, with the visitors absolutely ruthless in a 6-0 demolition. But it took them 32 minutes to open the scoring – and the floodgates – with their dead-ball nous proving reliable once again in finding a way through initially stubborn opposition. Alphonse Areola had just produced a stunning save to tip Leandro Trossard’s volley over, but the Frenchman was helpless at the resulting corner. Declan Rice’s delivery was exceptional; it had the pace and height to evade everyone at the front post or in the middle of the six-yard box, instead finding the crowd of Arsenal players at the back post. William Saliba was the one to get the decisive header in on goal, though there were four Arsenal players in that zone waiting for an opportunity to meet the ball. Another Rice set-piece caused havoc as Arsenal made it 3-0. The former West Ham captain’s wicked free-kick cross from the left flank flew towards the near post, and Gabriel Magalhães got on the end of it to glance beyond the helpless Areola for his 14th Premier League goal since arriving in England, the most of any defender since the start of the 2020-21 season. That in itself is evidence of how good Arsenal have become at set-pieces under Arteta and his dead-ball expert Nicolas Jover, with the Brazilian now only behind Laurent Koscielny (22) for goals scored by Arsenal defenders in Premier League history – it’s no coincidence. Jover is the one who’s been credited with their improvement in this area since following Arteta from Manchester City in 2021, and it should be pointed out that Arsenal being effective at set-pieces isn’t anything new – it’s just that this season they seem to have found another a level, a level above anyone else. So, what do they do? Well, you obviously have to mention the fact they simply have several players who are comfortably over six feet tall, two of whom joined them ahead of this season in Kai Havertz and Declan Rice; we can talk about intricate set-piece routines until the cows come home, but there’s no getting away from the fact having a taller, more physical team is clearly an advantage. But at the same time, using that as the sole explanation would be to completely overlook the fine work Jover has done and the seemingly endless ways Arsenal manoeuvre themselves at set-pieces to gain an edge. There’s no standing around hoping the ball lands right on your head; there are runs from front post to back post, back post to front post; runs along the goalline before curving back to get flick-ons at the near post; there are mischievous blocking tactics aplenty. And that’s just from corners. We also have to note their habit of having players start free-kick routines in an offside position to make themselves harder to track. Corners are where the majority of their set-piece goals come from, though. Their 11 goals from corners is two more than anyone else in the Premier League this term and they account for 20.8% of their overall haul of 53; only Everton (34.6%) and Luton (24.2%) score a greater proportion of their goals from corners. While Arsenal mix up their corner routines a great deal, there are two particularly common elements. Firstly, they pack the six-yard box more than any other team in the Premier League, averaging 3.31 players in that area at each corner – no other team averages over 2.93. This obviously suggests a focus on disrupting the goalkeeper and his defenders as close to goal as possible. It may not be revolutionary, but it’s certainly noteworthy considering their goals output. The other common denominator with Arsenal corners is their consistent preference for inswinging deliveries over outswinging ones. Just 0.7% of their crossed corners are outswingers, the lowest percentage in the division in 2023-24. Again, it’s not like Arsenal are pioneers of this – inswingers generally going closer to goal than outswingers is simple physics. But the fact they pack the six-yard box in conjunction with this approach gives us an idea of how much pressure they intend to put their opponents under, even if it doesn’t always work out. But there’s also more to it than sheer numbers in the danger zone and choosing inswinging over outswinging crosses. There are some aspects that are simply impossible to put numbers on – you have to actually see them, and Arsenal have created some routines that are definitely worth watching. Arguably the most effective of all they managed to pull off twice in one game against Crystal Palace. For the first, Trossard was the designated blocker in the six-yard box and he managed to obstruct two defenders, simultaneously opening a space for Gabriel to meet Declan Rice’s sumptuous cross and head home. Trossard was then the blocker again as Gabriel got his second, the Belgian preventing a couple of defenders from obstructing his teammate’s run to the back post, where he stooped to nod in Bukayo Saka’s deep delivery. There was another fine example of effective blocking against Sheffield United. Ben White’s earned himself something of a reputation for this as he shifted his body in front of goalkeeper Wes Foderingham and a defender, engaging them as soon as Saka’s cross was fired in. The disruption caused the keeper to unconvincingly flap at the ball, allowing Eddie Nketiah to blast in from close range. And then there’s the less conventional back-post-to-front-post run en masse that has been a feature this season and paid dividends at the weekend. When Rice began his run-up, there were five Arsenal players either at the back post or beyond it; West Ham weren’t marking to the man so were completely outnumbered in that part of the box, meaning the delivery just needed to be on the money – suffice to say, it was. It’s worth pointing out, as the graphic below shows, the majority of their corners target the near post. However, their 14 successful corner deliveries to the back post is second only to Everton (15), while the Gunners’ three goals from such situations is more than any other side in the Premier League this term, highlighting how effective they can be when looking to switch things up a bit. Such adaptability can only be a positive and another indication of Jover’s preparation and impact. We must also highlight Arsenal’s efficiency from free-kicks, 30 of which have been crosses into the box. Just under a quarter (7 – 23.3%) of those have led to a chance created, which sees them rank seventh. Three have led to assists, however, which equates to 10%, the best record in the Premier League this term – in fact, no other team has tallied more than one assist in this way during the 2023-24 season. What makes Arsenal’s output from set-pieces even more impressive is if we look at it in a historical context. This season, the Premier League is averaging 0.63 set-piece goals (excluding penalties) per game. Since the start of the 2006-07 season, the average has been 0.62, so the two figures are very similar. But Arsenal’s total of 16 is already just two off their record best over a full season in the same period (18 in 2008-09 and 2009-10), while their frequency of 0.67 set-piece goals per game is far beyond anything they’ve managed over an entire campaign before. Of course, there’s still a while to go in 2023-24 and they could slow down, but they’re enjoying a kind of productivity they’ve never seen before, with 0.47 set-piece goals per game (in 2008-09 and 2009-10) being their previous best. This is without there appearing to be a particularly notable ‘boom’ in goals of this variety in general across the league. We highlighted earlier in the season how Arsenal appeared to be struggling offensively, with their attacking numbers down almost across the board, but their threat from set-pieces has been fairly consistent and undoubtedly played a role in ensuring they didn’t fall too far behind City and Liverpool. Now, they appear to be firing on all cylinders after starting 2024 with four successive Premier League wins, three of which were particularly impressive.  They’re finding their groove at an opportune moment and still have the trump card of set-piece prowess – it could ultimately make the difference for them in the title race. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the clash and the key battles to expect at Kingsmeadow. Friday evening sees arguably the biggest fixture in the English women’s football calendar so far this season as Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Kingsmeadow in a clash between the top two sides in the Women’s Super League. Only three points separate them in the WSL table after 13 matchdays and Chelsea, who have been the team to beat in the last decade, are looking stronger than ever as they bid to continue that dominance in England. In a title pursuit that has taken on more significance after Emma Hayes announced she would be leaving in the summer to manage the US women’s national team, the Blues want to mark the end of an era with a record-breaking eighth league title in 10 years. Man City, on the other hand, would love to spoil the Chelsea party and pile on the pressure by beating their title rivals on their home turf. They have just one WSL title to their name so far, coming in 2016 when they finished five points ahead of – you guessed it – Chelsea. A win for Man City in this clash would put them on level terms and set up a tantalising final seven games for both clubs. Whatever happens, this fixture promises excitement, drama, and late goals. That was the case when the teams met in October at the Joie Stadium, a game in which England duo Alex Greenwood and Lauren Hemp both saw red. City took an early lead through Chloe Kelly and a resolute performance looked like sealing a valuable three points. That was until Guro Reiten equalised in the sixth minute of added time at the end of the game to snatch a draw – Chelsea’s second latest goal in WSL history (95:08). No side have been as consistently strong in WSL history as Chelsea, and they are on track to add another WSL title to their collection should they continue their current form. That consistency has seen the 2023-24 edition of the side secure the exact same start after 13 league games of the season as the 2022-23 team – winning 11 games and dropping just five points (D1 L1), while even conceding the same tally of goals (12). Man City are enjoying their third best start to a WSL season after 13 matches (31 points), but most importantly they have improved on their record at this stage last term (29 points) on the way to finishing fourth. Much of their failure to finish inside the top three in 2022-23 was a result of their end-of-season form, however. After defeating Chelsea 2-0 at home on 26 March (their 16th game), they went on to lose three of their final six games. Winning at home against Chelsea is one thing but defeating them away is a very different proposition. Hayes’ side have won a staggering 22 successive home matches in the WSL, a record streak that’s obliterated their own, and the WSL’s, previous record of 14 in a row back in January 2021.  Not only would a win in this match against City extend that to 23 home victories in a row, it would also see them set the outright WSL record for the longest unbeaten run at home to 34 games. The sheer magnitude of their success at home and the ability to create a fortress at Kingsmeadow has been a huge factor in the dominance Chelsea have enjoyed in recent years. It’s also no surprise the team they currently share the unbeaten record of 33 games with is Man City, who recorded their own impressive run in 2021. Over recent years, the two teams have pushed each other to the most incredible record-breaking heights, a pattern that shows no signs of stopping any time soon. To protect their position as joint leaders in the WSL unbeaten home record standings, City will have to undertake one of the toughest tasks in the competition – shutting a rampant Chelsea attack out. Only five sides in WSL history have scored more than 40 goals in their opening 13 games of a season, with this current Chelsea side (41) behind only Arsenal in 2018-19 (50), Liverpool in 2013 (44), Man City in 2020-21 (43) and themselves in 2019-20 (42) – all of those went on to win the title apart from City. Chelsea’s ruthlessness in front of goal has been what’s set them apart from other WSL sides so far this season. They’ve averaged three non-penalty goals per game, which is surpassed by only two sides in WSL history across a season – Arsenal in 2018-19 (3.3) and themselves in 2019-20 (3.1) – while only five sides have ever attempted a higher average of shots per game than this Chelsea side (19.8) within a single WSL season. Since expected goals (xG) data became available in 2017-18 for the WSL, only one side – again, Chelsea in 2019-20 (2.62) – have averaged a higher non-penalty xG per game rate than Hayes’ current crop (2.52). Converting those chances hasn’t been an issue either, with their non-penalty shot conversion of 15.2% being the best in the WSL this season and the 10th best in a single WSL season among all clubs. While City are far from slack in front of goal themselves as the second-highest scorers in the competition this season (35 goals, 34 excluding penalties), they don’t create chances at the quality of Chelsea, with their non-penalty xG of 1.87 per game 0.65 lower than Chelsea’s average. However, this could be a case of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. While Chelsea have thrived in attack, City have shown their defensive prowess. They have conceded fewer goals than any other WSL side (8) and only Arsenal (9.15 xG) have limited their opponents’ chances from non-penalty situations more than than City (9.49 xG). The Citizens’ incredible resistance has been key to helping them stay in contention for the title, and they are defending from the front too. So far this season, Man City have attempted the most shots from high turnovers (41), while the proportion of their total high turnovers ending in shots is also a league-high (19%), suggesting their pick and choose when to press with maximum effect. Gareth Taylor’s side also led the WSL for shot-ending high turnovers last season (62), with their high press something that his team are becoming well known for. Since the start of last season, Chelsea have faced Man City three times in the WSL and two of their lowest non-penalty xG totals in that time have come against Taylor’s team – 0.61 in September 2022 and 0.64 in March 2023. They’ve frustrated Chelsea before, and they could keep their attack at bay again this Friday. The race for the WSL 2023-24 Golden Boot features two of the hottest talents in women’s football. Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw and Lauren James could both be the gamechangers for their respective teams on Friday. Shaw is currently leading the race, netting 13 goals in 12 games for Man City, while James is just one goal behind, with 12 in as many appearances for Chelsea this season. Jamaican international Shaw has set the WSL alight since she joined the league from Bordeaux in 2021. Although last season saw her fall short of securing the top scorer award by two goals, after a phenomenal campaign by Aston Villa’s Rachel Daly (22 goals), Shaw has been the hottest scoring talent in the competition since her debut in September 2021. Since that game against Everton, where she made a scoring debut in a 4-0 win at Goodison Park, the City striker has a league-high tally of 42 goals in 51 games – remarkably just one of those have come from the penalty shot. She also leads the league in xG both overall (30.8) and from non-penalty shots (29.2), while only five players have bettered her assist tally of 13, meaning she also leads the WSL for total goal involvements (55) ahead of Chelsea’s Sam Kerr (48). Arguably no player has made a bigger impact on the WSL overall than Kerr, but she is ruled out injured long-term after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a Chelsea training camp in January, which has added the pressure on England international James to perform for the Blues. England star James has returned from last summer’s Women’s World Cup hungry to prove she can make the difference for both club and country. Her goal tally this season is just two off what she’d managed across her previous five WSL seasons combined (14 in 51 apps), showing how far the 22-year-old has progressed post-World Cup. It’s both Shaw (0.71) and James (0.51) who lead the WSL this season for non-penalty xG per 90 (of players to have played at least 650 minutes), showing how much of a threat both will be to the opposition this weekend in front of goal. Hayes will look to James to lead the charge for the Blues and she has not disappointed since returning from the Christmas break, scoring a hat-trick against Manchester United last month to keep the pressure on their top-four rivals followed by two more in the 2-0 away win at Brighton on 27 January. James, however, was missing in last weekend’s FA Cup 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace, with Hayes hopeful she would be back for the key fixtures to follow. “She was a little bit sick, her tonsils were up and I decided not to take the risk,” said Hayes. “I told her to go home. She will be fine – you have to make those decisions knowing you’ve got some big games coming up.” No one expected this to be Hayes’ final season when the league kicked off in September, and her announcement that she would be leaving at the end of 2023-24 to take the USWNT job came as a shock. During her magnificent tenure at the Blues, they have won six FA WSL titles, five Women’s FA Cups, two FA Women’s League Cups, one FA Women’s Spring Series trophy and one FA Women’s Community Shield. Hayes has been an ambassador not only for the women’s team but her influence on Chelsea runs deep to its core, highlighted by her being named one of the trustees during the departure of owner Roman Abramovich in 2022. She has been a custodian the club has entrusted in so many areas across her time with the Blues. Hayes admitted the United States role was the “only job” that could pry her away from Chelsea but make no mistake her desire to win and finish on a high is stronger than ever. Chelsea are still in contention to win four trophies this season, including the biggest prize to elude Hayes in her managerial career so far: the UEFA Women’s Champions League. Hayes’ record since the start of the 2018-19 season is quite remarkable. Over that period, she has a WSL win rate of 78.9% from 114 matches and the only manager in recent times to come anywhere close to her was Joe Montemurro, who matched 78.9%, albeit across exactly half the tally of matches (57). Hayes has registered a remarkable 2.50 points per WSL game in that time, with Chelsea’s players now hoping to give her a fitting send off. With the disappointment of losing Kerr, Chelsea looked to the transfer market to ensure they had the firepower and depth to ensure success in their manager’s final season. Mayra Ramírez joined from Spanish club Levante as the WSL’s most expensive player, a £384,000 deal that only trailed Racheal Kundananji’s move to Bay FC and Keira Walsh’s switch to Barcelona globally, and could go higher once add-ons are factored in. A highly sought after forward, Ramírez shone in the first half of the season at Levante before her move to London, netting six goals in just seven league appearances. In Chelsea’s 1-0 FA Cup win over Palace last weekend, Ramírez was a constant threat and attempted more shots (4) and accumulated a higher xG total (0.56) than any of her teammates as she went on to score the winner nine minutes from time. She is still waiting for her first league goal, but there would be no better time to open her account than on Friday night. The player who could provide the chances for Ramírez and someone City will need to keep quiet is Fran Kirby. Only Chloe Kelly (30) has created more open-play chances in the WSL than Kirby (25) this season, while only Kelly (4.2) and Lauren Hemp (3.6) have a higher expected assists total than the Chelsea star (3.4). As for England duo Hemp and Kelly, they will be key to the chances of Taylor’s side. Only Arsenal’s Victoria Pelova (5) has more assists than Kelly, while not only has she been prolific for chance creation for her teammates, but she’s also had more shots on target (25) than every other WSL player in 2023-24 so far. Another outstanding contributor to City’s great season so far has been Khiara Keating, who will take confidence from her performance in the reverse fixture, when the goalkeeper was influential to keeping Hayes’ side at bay until their last-gasp leveller. Keating also thwarted Arsenal last weekend, making five saves in the FA Cup as City knocked the Gunners out with a 1-0 win. She has conceded just eight goals in the WSL this season despite having faced 42 shots on target and has proved to be formidable in the City goal. Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) model shows Keating has prevented 3.9 goals, which leads the WSL. Her fine form has forced out teammate Ellie Roebuck from the England set up and the City No.1 shirt, so Chelsea will have to be clinical in front of goal to get the upper hand on Keating. Chelsea are desperate to be crowned champions once again but these two sides look more closely matched than ever in their race for the title. This game is set to provide the biggest marker yet in the race to lift the WSL trophy, as Chelsea seek that magical number eight and City eye what would be a famous second crown. Hayes won’t have forgotten a 2-0 loss that handed Man City with their first ever WSL crown in 2016 and she won’t want to see her side hand them another opportunity to be champions. Enjoy this?

Roberto De Zerbi is on the cusp of changing his starting goalkeeper on 15 different occasions, which would be the most by any Premier League side in a single season. But why? And is it even working? Chopping and changing his starting XI is nothing new for Roberto De Zerbi. The Brighton manager has made a startling 91 changes to his starting lineups this season, 23 more than any other team in the top flight (Nottingham Forest, 68). Brighton’s figure is also almost three times as many as Unai Emery at Aston Villa, who’s made a league-low 32 tweaks. In fairness, Brighton have been unluckier than most in terms of losing players to long-term injuries. Solly March, Julio Enciso, Pervis Estupiñán, Joël Veltman and Ansu Fati have all had lengthy spells on the sidelines and that has forced De Zerbi into necessary changes. One position he has had full control over has been in goal. But even then, neither Jason Steele nor Bart Verbruggen have been spared. De Zerbi has rotated his goalkeepers 14 times in the league, which is a joint record for the number of different goalkeeper rotations for a single team in a season in Premier League history. With 14 games left to go, it seems fairly likely Brighton are going to break this record. Rotation hasn’t just been limited to the league, either. Verbruggen started in each of Brighton’s domestic cup matches – twice in the FA Cup and once in the League Cup – but Steele was favoured in the Europa League, starting in four of Brighton’s group games. The fact De Zerbi has been so liberal with rotating his goalkeepers shouldn’t come as a surprise. After all, he warned us ahead of the season that Steele and Verbruggen would receive a 50-50 split of minutes across all competitions. Unlike Mikel Arteta, whose announcement that he’d be rotating his two No. 1 goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale and David Raya was met with heavy scepticism, De Zerbi’s didn’t ruffle any feathers. What’s more, De Zerbi has actually followed through on his promise, while Arteta has mainly reneged on his: Raya is now the clear No. 1 having started 19 of Arsenal’s 24 league matches. It remains exceptionally rare for teams to rotate their goalkeepers with anywhere near the same frequency as outfielders. Across the last five Premier League seasons, there have been 20 instances of a Premier League team having two of its goalkeepers make 10+ starts in a single season. And of that total, Brighton’s current Steele-Verbruggen roulette is the only example that can be considered a genuine rotation. The other instances can be attributed to one goalkeeper suffering injury or a genuine change in who is the preferred first-choice. The prevailing wisdom is that goalkeeper is too specialised a position for rotation; that goalkeepers benefit from the confidence and rhythm that come with playing consecutive games. That defences also benefit from having the same keeper behind them. So, why is De Zerbi bucking this trend? The simplest assumption is that his two keepers excel in different areas of the game. Much of the discourse between Ramsdale and Raya was centred on the assumption that the former was the better shot-stopper, and the latter was better with the ball at his feet. That parallel has been applied by some to Brighton’s goalkeeping duo, with Steele praised for his ball-playing abilities – not least by De Zerbi himself – and Verbruggen considered the superior shot-stopper. But a deeper look into the data suggests that Verbruggen can match Steele in the ball-playing department, while also bettering him with his saves. “I have one core quality and that is my feet,” Verbruggen told Belgian outlet HLN in February last year while at Anderlecht. “I feel very comfortable on the ball, I excel at that.” That’s not just talk. Making the considerable step up to the Premier League this term, the Dutch goalkeeper has completed 34.9 passes per game in the top flight this season, doing so at an 89.5% pass success rate. Both are highs for any goalkeeper in the entire division. And De Zerbi does not change his approach in any way when Verbruggen is in goal, encouraging his side to play out from the back just as often. Overall, a staggering 87.8% of Brighton’s goal-kicks this season end in their own box, by far the largest proportion of any team, and Steele and Verbruggen’s kicking style remains very similar in how they distribute from the back. We can use sequences to get more insight into what happens after Steele or Verbruggen are involved in Brighton’s passing moves. Looking at how many of those passing moves actually end in a shot reveals that Verbruggen is slightly more effective when it comes to helping his side generate chances. The Dutchman is involved in more shot-ending open-play sequences than his counterpart, and at a rate of 1.6 involvements per 90 minutes, he trails only Ederson (2.3) and Alisson (2.0) in this regard, both of whom play for extremely dominant teams. Now, playing out from the back with this regularity comes with its risks. And that’s perhaps where the more inexperienced Verbruggen has fallen short this year. He’s made two errors directly leading to opposition goals this season – one against Bournemouth in September where he dallied on the ball, got robbed and Dominic Solanke had an open goal to finish into, and a second against Crystal Palace where his attempted clearance was intercepted by Michael Olise and eventually led to Jordan Ayew’s opener. Interestingly, after both those errors, De Zerbi dropped Verbruggen for the next league fixture, perhaps as a way of taking him out of the limelight. Steele, in contrast, hasn’t made a single error that’s even led to a shot this year. He’s cleaner with the ball at his feet and also plainly very capable of playing the way De Zerbi wants to. In high-profile, high-leverage situations, maybe that trust is something De Zerbi is calling upon. If the two profile similarly in possession, then it’s in their shot-stopping where Verbruggen has upside. Both keepers are having an underwhelming season in terms of their goals prevented metrics, with both conceding more goals than their expected goals on target figures suggest they ‘should have’. Steele has conceded 23 goals from 21.5 xGOT, letting in 1.5 more goals than the average goalkeeper would have done, while Verbruggen is down at -2 goals prevented. Those figures put both Brighton goalkeepers in the bottom seven for all Premier League stoppers this season. It’s worth pointing out that both goalkeepers are part of a porous Brighton defence that has been very open at times this term. Each shot the Seagulls have conceded has been worth 0.12 xG on average – the sixth-worst rate in the league – so it’s not surprising to see both struggle to save high-value chances. Verbruggen’s save percentage of 65.9% is roughly league average, while Steele’s (59.0%) is the second-worst of any keeper in the top flight. \\xa0 Looking back to last season paints a similar picture for Steele, who conceded 20 goals from 18.7 on target (-1.3 goals prevented), which was better than his teammate Robert Sánchez (-2.5) but still nothing to write home about. Verbruggen, albeit in the inferior Belgian Pro League, had a far better 2022-23 campaign with his hands, preventing 3.4 goals for Anderlecht (the third-highest for any goalkeeper) as well as boasting the best save percentage of any keeper in the league (75.3%). Verbruggen’s shown the potential to pair excellent distribution skills with above-average shot-stopping and at the tender age of 21 there’s plenty of reason to suggest he can combine those in the cauldron of the Premier League. The fact he made his first international senior appearances under Ronald Koeman for the Netherlands in Euro 2024 qualifiers in October shows how highly thought of he is. In making his debut against France, Verbruggen became the youngest Dutch goalkeeper to start a game since Jan van Beveren in 1967. With Steele aged 33, Verbruggen appears to be the future No. 1 at Brighton. Given his youth, there might need to be a bedding in process. De Zerbi even hinted to this in some interviews last year. Speaking in November 2023 after Steele had signed a new contract, his manager said: “Jason is playing well. I think he knows very well my idea. Verbruggen is not the same level but is very important for us now and the future.” But that was three months ago, and with Brighton on a torrid run of just four Premier League wins in their last 18 games, their season is in real danger of completely fizzling out. Perhaps it is time to start trusting Verbruggen. It’s not as if Brighton are any worse off with him in goal anyway, with their win percentage slightly higher in games when he’s started (40%) compared to when Steele’s started (35.7%). That doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the quality of opposition they’ve faced, either, with Steele playing against opponents with an average league position of 10th in the league when they’ve played Brighton, compared to 12th for Verbruggen. Verbruggen told reporters after Brighton’s 4-1 over Crystal Palace that he has mixed feelings about the rotation situation. “It’s the first time I have experienced [this rotation],” he said. “It has its challenges but there are good sides about it. The most important thing is I can genuinely say Jason is a brilliant person.” Steele may well be a great presence next to Verbruggen, but maybe it is finally time for De Zerbi to see if Brighton have found their long-term heir.

The 2023-24 season has seen unprecedented quality from the penalty spot. With 90% of spot-kicks converted, this campaign has so far been the most prolific from 12 yards in Premier League history. The introduction of VAR, initially at least, led to more penalties being given. The 2020-21 Premier League season – the second after VAR was introduced – saw more penalties than ever before. A penalty was taken every 3.0 games, meaning 125 in total – 13 more than ever before in a Premier League campaign. 2023-24 has seen penalties awarded at the third-highest rate in the competition’s history (one every 3.4 games). This recent increase may have prompted Premier League players to spend a little longer practising their penalty-taking. After all, if they were going to be taking more penalties, they may as well maximise their chances of scoring. There have also been rule changes that have made the goalkeeper’s job more difficult, most notably that they have to stay on their line until the point the attacker strikes the ball. Before this season, the Premier League had never seen penalties scored at more than the 83.9% success rate seen in 2013-14. The seasonal penalty-conversion rate has dropped as low as 65.8% (2001-02), and has been beneath 75% in seven different seasons. One of those was last season, when just 74.8% of penalties were scored. But penalty-success rates are on the rise. When looking at the five-season rolling average of penalty-conversion rates in the Premier League, you can see exactly how much they are going up. It appears as though that low rate in 2022-23 was an anomaly. It makes sense, given the overall standard of football is rising so much. Penalties are as discrete, repeatable, and learnable a skill as you get in the entire sport, and these incredibly talented players can practise that skill over and over. It means the elite can disguise their intentions from the opposition goalkeeper expertly, and can find the corners of the goal more effectively than ever before. Those numbers are, however, being boosted in recent years by remarkable numbers when penalties are aimed straight down the middle of the goal. The conversion rate of penalties aimed into the middle of the goal is markedly higher than elsewhere. It’s worth pointing out here that we haven’t quite used Opta’s exact definition for putting a penalty down the middle. For data-collection purposes, one way in which all shots – including penalties – are sorted is by the exact coordinates of where the ball reaches the goal. Shots placed into the middle third of the goal are deemed to be in the ‘centre’ zone. But for the purposes of our research here, we want to take more than just end location into account. We only looked at penalties placed into the centre zone – either high or low – but we only want penalties that were specifically aimed there, too. This therefore disregards penalties that were directed towards the corner but were mishit and ended up in the middle zone. Of course, only the taker will know for sure where exactly they wanted to place the penalty, but it is generally possible to get a decent idea from watching replays of each penalty back what their intentions were. So, considering only penalties that were aimed down the middle and went down the middle, we discovered that these brought even greater success. In 2023-24, 15 spot-kicks have been placed in the middle of the goal, and 14 have been scored, the only exception being Mohamed Salah’s drilled effort against Newcastle last month that Martin Dubravka kept out (more on that one later). Last season, when penalties were scored at one of the lowest rates in Premier League history (74.7%), 20 penalties were aimed down the middle of the goal, and 19 were scored. James Maddison’s spot-kick against Everton – saved by Jordan Pickford – in May 2023 was the only one of them that was missed. Pickford revealed after the game that he knew Maddison put lots of his penalties down the middle, and “double bluffed” his England teammate by standing still. So, that means a 93.3% success rate this season for penalties aimed down the middle – compared to 89.1% when put towards the corners. Last season, 95% of penalties struck down the middle were scored, compared to 69.6% when aimed elsewhere. Across those two seasons, 21.2% of penalties (35 of 165) have been hit down the middle. So, this leads us to the question: why don’t more goalkeepers stand still at penalties? There are a few things to consider here. Firstly, with the rise of the ‘goalkeeper-dependent’ penalty-taking method – where the taker runs up to the ball slowly, waiting for the goalkeeper to move one way and then place the ball the other – sometimes penalties are aimed down the middle specifically because the goalkeeper has moved out of the way. If the goalkeeper had stayed still a split-second longer, the penalty might have been placed into the corner. However, the vast majority of goalkeeper-dependent penalties are placed into the corners because by definition the goalkeepers move late and so a shot down the middle of the goal comes with the risk that the goalkeeper hasn’t pushed off far enough to get out of the way by the time the ball reaches the goal line. Indeed, most of the penalties in the last two seasons that have been aimed straight down the middle of the goal have been goalkeeper-independent penalties. In other words, the taker has pre-determined that they are going to aim down the middle, working to the assumption that the goalkeeper will dive. That works so often simply because goalkeepers do tend to dive. They can be made to look pretty silly if they just stand still – and doing so will leave them open to criticism from fans that their goalkeeper hasn’t even tried to save the penalty. In the second image, Pickford – someone who is bold enough to stay still and, as we have mentioned already, has had some joy in doing so – watches on as Salah’s Merseyside-derby penalty flies into the corner of the net at Anfield in October of this season. Although on this occasion it didn’t work, standing still against Salah isn’t a bad idea at all. The Liverpool forward has aimed a penalty straight down the middle more times in the last two Premier League seasons (four) than anyone else. Brighton’s Bart Verbruggen had done the same thing in Liverpool’s previous game. He, too, expected Salah to go down the middle from the spot at the Amex Stadium, only for Salah to put it to his side. Verbruggen dived too late and the ball was well past him by the time he made it over to the side of the goal. So, in successive games in October, Salah faced goalkeepers who predicted he would put his penalty down the middle. He didn’t take another penalty until Newcastle visited Anfield on New Year’s Day. Yet again, the goalkeeper he faced stood still, only this time Dubravka kept it out as Salah went down the middle. It led to Salah placing his second penalty of the game low to Dubravka’s right, with the Slovakian guessing the other way. It’s a real game of chicken, and you can see why goalkeepers rarely opt to stay still, if only for fear of being made to look a fool. Only two of the 70 penalties taken in the Premier League in 2023-24 has missed the target, and even then both have hit the woodwork (Erling Haaland vs Sheffield United and Darwin Núñez vs Chelsea). That statistic alongside the fact that more are being scored than ever before suggests penalty-takers really are better than ever before. As goalkeepers have to stay rooted to their goal line and can’t move too early because the taker will simply put the ball the other way, diving to save a penalty is more difficult than ever before. So, there’s an argument standing still at a penalty might even increase the keeper’s chance of saving the shot. From the taker’s perspective, going straight down the middle is in many ways the easiest option. It’s harder to miss the target when avoiding the corners, and goalkeepers so rarely stand still that it’s about as foolproof as penalty-taking gets. Maybe it’s time for goalkeepers across the Premier League to address this issue and take a stand – by standing still at penalties more often. Enjoy this?

We look back across the history of the competition to give you a run down of the top 10 oldest to take charge of a match. Roy Hodgson made his second surprising managerial comeback with a return to the Crystal Palace dugout on April Fools Day 2023 – but this was no hoax.  At the end of 2020-21, Hodgson had “ended” his 45-year managerial career as Crystal Palace manager with their Premier League trip to former club Liverpool at Anfield. That was until January 2022, when the former England manager decided to have one last crack at the big time when taking over at Watford. Hodgson hadn’t ever suffered relegation from the Premier League before this managerial spell, and when taking over there was a good chance that he could continue that run – Watford were just two points from safety with two games in hand on 17th-placed Norwich City. It didn’t work out well for the veteran, however. Hodgson helped Watford win just nine points in 18 games as manager, with his 0.50 points per game at the club by far the lowest he’d ever achieved at a Premier League side. This average was even lower than his predecessor Claudio Ranieri – the fifth oldest Premier League manager – who averaged 0.54 points-per-game at the Hornets. Fast-forward to March 2023 and Crystal Palace had just relieved Patrick Vieira of his duties as their manager. A few days later, Hodgson made a sensational return to the club, taking the reigns at the south London side in their battle to avoid relegation. He made the perfect start, beating fellow relegation-threatened Leicester City at Selhurst Park and sealing the club’s first Premier League win in 13 attempts. They did it in style, too – attempting 31 shots in the victory, which was a joint club record since detailed shot data began being collected in 2003-04. Hodgson’s side picked up the win thanks to a goal from Jean-Philippe Mateta deep into injury-time. His strike on 93 minutes 39 seconds was Crystal Palace’s second-latest Premier League winner on record (since 2006-07), after Christian Benteke’s vs. Brighton in February 2021 (94:10) and their latest ever on record in a home game in the competition. The veteran manager steered Palace to safety with an 11th place finish and has continued as boss in 2023-24 after signing a new one-year deal to stay on in the summer. As a result, Hodgson will set a new record each week he takes charge of a game. The much-admired Bobby Robson was 71 years, 192 days old on his final Premier League game as a manager, with Newcastle’s 0-0 draw at Aston Villa his last. This was only the Magpies’ second Premier League game of the 2004-05 campaign, but club chairman Freddy Shepherd decided that it was time for a change in management at Newcastle, albeit with strange reasoning. This wasn’t Robson’s only stint as a top-flight manager in England, but it was his only spell as a Premier League manager. He secured 83 wins and a points-per-game average of 1.60 across his 188 games in the competition. Robson had previously spent over 13 years as boss of Ipswich Town between 1969-1982, winning the UEFA Cup there in 1981. He also managed in Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, winning a major trophy in each country and picking up league titles with Porto and PSV Eindhoven. His job at Newcastle United was his final managerial role in football, with him managing his first game at 66 years and 205 days old – that would have put him 11th in this list as it was, and just 11 days shy of the age that Sam Allardyce was when he managed his final game in 2021. Former Barcelona boss Robson might not have won a trophy at the Magpies, but he’ll be forever remembered as one of the best English club managers of all-time, as well as one of the most respected England coaches following the Three Lions’ 1990 World Cup performance. He died in July 2009 aged 76, less than five years after his last game as a manager. There’s only been one 5-5 draw in the entire history of the Premier League, but it came in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final game as a manager. The Scotsman took charge of Manchester United for the 1,500th and final time at the Hawthorns in this Premier League meeting with West Brom, aged 71 years and 139 days old. Ferguson won 13 top-flight English league titles as a manager during his 27 years at Manchester United – more than twice as many as any other manager in the history of the league and seven more than his closest rivals. One of these 13 arrived in this final season (2012-13), with United having won the title nearly a month before this meeting with WBA. In the nine seasons since Ferguson’s retirement, the Red Devils haven’t won a single Premier League title under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick or current boss Erik ten Hag. Obviously – with Robson and Hodgson never having done so – Fergie is the oldest manager to win a Premier League title. If Pep Guardiola was to break this record, he’d need to be managing in the competition in 2042-44 while Jürgen Klopp could do it in 2038-39.  Ferguson has won the most games (528) and most points (1,752) as a Premier League manager, with only Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger (828) having managed more games in the competition than the former Man Utd boss (810). Neil Warnock was still managing in the second tier in England until recently, with the then 74-year-old leaving Championship side Huddersfield Town in September 2023 after saving them from relegation in 2022-23. Now 75, there are always links between Warnock and other EFL jobs, but it feels unlikely we’ll ever see him in a Premier League dugout again. Warnock’s last game as a top-flight coach came in May 2019 with a shock 2-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford, despite his Cardiff City side already having been relegated to the Championship. Cardiff’s victory in this match came courtesy of a Nathaniel Mendez-Laing brace and was their first victory over Manchester United since 3 April 1954, when Warnock was just five years old. Claudio Ranieri became only the fifth man aged 70-plus to manage a team in a Premier League game when he took charge of Watford at Everton on October 23, 2021, celebrating the occasion with a brilliant 5-2 victory against the Toffees at Goodison Park. However, his spell at Watford didn’t last long – 112 days to be exact. Ranieri was sacked for poor performance after just 13 matches and two wins. At the time of his sacking, he was the oldest manager in the Premier League (70) and he is now the oldest in Serie A after turning 72 years old in October 2023 – two years and one month older than Empoli boss Aurelio Andreazzoli.  He took Cagliari back into the top flight after winning promotion from Serie B last season, while overall, he’s taken charge of over 850 top-flight games across the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A and La Liga with 227 of these games coming in the Premier League across his career at Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City and the Hornets – famously winning the Premier League title against all the odds with Leicester in 2015-16. Guus Hiddink was nudged out of fifth place in the ranking of the oldest Premier League managers earlier in 2021-22 by Ranieri, with the Dutch boss now in sixth place at 69 years, 189 days old when he took charge of Chelsea versus Leicester City in May 2016 at Stamford Bridge. This was his final match in the competition, before relinquishing his short-term position as boss of the Blues to Antonio Conte. Sam Allardyce was shipped in to try and save Leeds United from Premier League relegation last season, when he replaced Javi Gracia on 3 May 2023 with just four games remaining. In his 30 days in charge of Leeds, he won just one point (W0 D1 L3) and saw Leeds relegated in 19th position. In his final game in charge in the competition on 28 May 2023 (a 4-1 loss to Spurs), Allardyce was 68 years, 221 days old, making him the seventh oldest Premier League manager. Arsène Wenger may top the Premier League ranking for games managed (828), but he’s only the eighth oldest to manage a match in the competition. His final game saw him lead his Arsenal side to a 1-0 away win at Huddersfield Town in May 2018 at the age of 68 years, 203 days old. Wenger has famously won the FA Cup more often than any other manager (seven) but couldn’t end his managerial reign at the Gunners with an eighth in 2017-18. The ninth oldest boss in Premier League history was Dick Advocaat, who was 68 years and six days old when he took charge of Sunderland versus West Ham in October 2015. He quit the club just a day after this game, with Sunderland winless in eight top-flight matches in 2015-16. Harry Redknapp was 67 years, 335 days old in his final match as a Premier League manager, with his QPR side losing 3-1 to Stoke City in January 2015. He resigned just days later with the Hoops in the relegation zone, where they eventually finished before dropping to the Championship. Redknapp took charge of 641 games in the Premier League, with most of these coming at West Ham United (269), but his most successful spell came at Tottenham Hotspur, with Spurs averaging 1.74 points per game under him. Redknapp was over a year older than the 11th oldest Premier League manager of all-time, Marcelo Bielsa. Bielsa was 66 years and 220 days old on the day of his final Premier League match in charge of Leeds United on 26 February 2022 – a 4-0 loss to Spurs at Elland Road. Enjoy this?

Here, we look over the top-scoring players in UCL history. Cristiano Ronaldo: 140Lionel Messi: 129Robert Lewandowski: 92Karim Benzema: 90Raúl: 71Ruud van Nistelrooy: 56Thomas Müller: 53Thierry Henry: 50Andriy Shevchenko: 48Zlatan Ibrahimovic: 48Filippo Inzaghi: 46Didier Drogba: 44Mohamed Salah: 44Kylian Mbappé: 44Neymar: 43Alessandro Del Piero: 42Sergio Agüero: 41Erling Haaland: 40 *All goal totals exclude UCL qualifiers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in the UEFA Champions League with 140 goals. With the Portuguese now playing at Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr, it’s unlikely that he’ll add to this tally, which he accumulated over spells at Manchester United (21), Real Madrid (105) and Juventus (14). Ronaldo holds the record for most goals in a single Champions League season, with his 17 goals for Real Madrid in 2013-14, as they won the UCL trophy with a win over Atlético Madrid in the final that campaign, while he followed that up with 16 goals two years later in 2015-16. The Portuguese legend has won the competition top scorer award on seven different occasions, which is a record across both the European Cup and Champions League eras. He scored in a record 93 different UCL matches – 51% of his appearances in the competition, while eight of those saw him score a hat-trick, which is a record he shares with Lionel Messi. Ronaldo found the net against 38 different opponents in his Champions League career, with his 10 goals versus Juventus the most by any single player against an opponent in the history of the competition. Lionel Messi is the second highest scorer in UEFA Champions League history with 129 goals. He does, however, hold the record of scoring the most goals for a single club in UCL history, with 120 of his 129 goals coming at Barcelona. He added nine more after moving to Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021, but it’s unlikely he’ll ever get a chance to add to his 129 goal-tally following his move to MLS club Inter Miami. Messi’s record of scoring against 40 different opponents in the UEFA Champions League is a record, ahead of Ronaldo’s tally of 38. Nine of those goals came against Arsenal (7%), his favourite opponent in UCL history. Overall, 2022 World Cup winner Messi has scored in 18 different seasons of UCL action, netting in every campaign since 2005-06 after failing to score in his only appearance for Barcelona in his debut season of 2004-05. He shares this record with Karim Benzema, but the French striker has managed to score in all 18 of the UCL seasons that he’s played in since 2005-06. He may share the UCL record for the most hat-tricks in the competition with Cristiano Ronaldo (eight), but he once did something the Portuguese never managed: score five goals in a single Champions League match. He managed this in Barcelona’s 7-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in March 2012 as part of his record-breaking 2011-12 season in which he scored 73 goals in 60 competitive club appearances. Robert Lewandowski is edging towards the century of UEFA Champions League goals, but with the Barcelona striker still eight goals away and now 35 years of age, he may run out of time. He tried his best in 2022-23, with five goals in five appearances for Barcelona, but their group-stage elimination sent them into the UEFA Europa League so Lewandowski had a bigger gap between UCL games than he’s used to. Of his 92 UCL goals, 69 came at Bayern Munich after he arrived from Borussia Dortmund. He holds the Bayern record for the most goals in Europe, ahead of Gerd Müller (65). He also holds the Bundesliga club’s record for most goals in a single season within the competition, with his 15-goal effort in 2019-20 on the way to Bayern winning the competition. In doing so, he became the first Polish player to finish as the top scorer in a single season of UCL/European Cup action. With his transfer to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, Karim Benzema might be 90 and out. Benzema has scored in the most UCL seasons without having failed to find the net in one, scoring in all 18 seasons of the competition since 2005-06 at Lyon. The French striker won the Champions League top scorer award for the first time ever in 2021-22, with his 15 goals helping Real Madrid to the title, although he failed to score in the final win over Liverpool in Paris. His 78 goals for Real Madrid in the competition are only behind Cristiano Ronaldo’s 105. Former Spanish international Raúl is Real Madrid’s third highest scoring player in UEFA Champions League history (66), while his overall tally of 71 is the fifth most of all players in the competition. Raúl was the top scoring player in the competition until November 2014, when he was eventually overtaken by Messi and Ronaldo, while the Real Madrid great was the first player to reach 50 goals in the competition, in September 2005. In fact, he was the first Real player to reach 50 goals in Europe after Alfredo Di Stéfano had previously scored 49 times in European competition for the Spanish side. His final season in the competition came at German side FC Schalke 04 in 2010-11, when he scored five times as a 33-year-old. This took his overall tally to 71 in the competition, which is more than double the next best by a Spanish player in the competition: Fernando Morientes’ 33 goals. Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 56 goals overall in the UEFA Champions League, but that tally could have been more had he played more UCL action earlier in his career. He made just 11 appearances at PSV before his 25th birthday and debut for Manchester United in the competition. No player reached 50 UEFA Champions League goals quicker than Van Nistelrooy (62 appearances) but he was 31 years old when he broke that mark. He scored 35 goals in the Champions League for Manchester United – a club record, ahead of Wayne Rooney (30) and Ryan Giggs (28). Van Nistelrooy is the top scoring player to have never won the UEFA Champions League, despite playing 11 seasons in the competition and playing for clubs that have won the trophy a combined 10 times. Thomas Müller just played his 15th Champions League season as a Bayern Munich player, scoring in 14 of these (only failing in 2018-19). Since his competition debut in 2008-09, he’s scored 53 goals and has 23 assists. His goal tally is more than double that of any other German player in the competition: Mario Gomez (26). He’s won the Champions League on two occasions with Bayern Munich, in both 2012-13 and 2019-20. Thierry Henry scored 50 goals in the UEFA Champions League across three clubs: Arsenal (35), Barcelona (eight) and Monaco (seven). He began life as a UCL player in style, with six goals across his first five appearances at Monaco as a 20-year-old, before moving to Arsenal in 1999-00. His 35 goals at the Gunners make him their highest scoring player in Champions League/European Cup history. With all of the players to have scored 50-plus UEFA Champions League goals either retired or in the twilight years of their career, the focus is now on which players could eventually go on and break the UCL scoring records in years to come. Kylian Mbappé looks the solid bet to reach 50 goals in the competition next, with the PSG and France forward on 44 UCL goals after netting against Lazio in the first leg of his side’s last-16 tie in Paris. He’s now ahead of former teammate Neymar (43) and has drawn level with both Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (44) and former Chelsea and Marseille striker Didier Drogba.  The speed at which Mbappé is rising up the ranking should begin to worry Cristiano Ronaldo at the top of the standings. Mbappé scored seven goals in eight Champions League appearances for PSG in 2022-23 before their last 16 elimination to Bayern Munich. He reached 40 goals in the competition in 59 games – two fewer than it took Messi and Robert Lewandowski (61) and 23 games quicker than Ronaldo (82). He is also the youngest of all 17 players to have reached 40 goals in the competition (23 years, 316 days) – breaking Messi’s previous record of doing so at 24 years and 130 days old. The French star will be looking over his shoulder at Manchester City’s goalscoring phenomenon Erling Haaland, however. Haaland has now scored a ridiculous 40 goals in 36 Champions League appearances after scoring against RB Leipzig (again), and he’s still only 23 years old. To put that into context, the previous record for most goals by a player in their opening 36 UCL appearances was held by Van Nistelrooy, who’d netted 31 goals at the same point of his UCL career as Haaland is now – nine fewer than the current Man City striker has managed. He hit 40 UCL goals at an age (23 years, 130 days) that was 187 days younger than Mbappé did and it took him fewer matches compared to Frenchman (59) and Lionel Messi (61). Haaland also became just one of three players to score five goals in a single Champions League match in Man City’s last-16 win over RB Leipzig in March 2023. Enjoy this?

Can anyone stop them extending their record to 36 Spanish top-flight titles? We’re now 240 games into the 2023-24 La Liga season, with just 37% of the campaign left to go. The Spanish top flight is now taking shape, with genuine contenders for European qualification spots now formed and a battle at the bottom for survival taking place. This makes it an ideal opportunity to check in on how the Opta supercomputer projects the rest of the season playing out. It’s been a good campaign in La Liga for fans of goals, with the current goals-per-game average of 2.64 the highest in the competition since 2017-18. The top two sides Real Madrid and Girona have contributed 52 each, with their totals the most in the competition ahead of Barcelona (50). This weekend saw those two sides at the summit of the Spanish top-flight table meet in the capital, with Madrid running out 4-0 winners in a dominant performance. That made it 18 league games unbeaten for Carlo Ancelotti’s side, which is their longest run in La Liga since September 2021 (25 games). They last tasted defeat in La Liga on 24 September versus rivals Atlético Madrid, and since their following game on 27 September they have dropped just eight points (W14 D4) and won six points more than any other side. Such is their excellent form, the Opta supercomputer sees little chance of anyone challenging them to the title with just 14 matchdays to go. Madrid – league winners for the last time in 2021-22 – won the title in 97.5% of the 10,000 current season simulations by the Opta supercomputer. That’s their highest projected chance of title success all season and more than double their pre-season projection of 47.7%. Much of the difference from pre-season to now in the seasonal predictions can be explained by Barcelona’s poor campaign. They began 2023-24 as reigning champions and second favourites in the La Liga title race by the Opta supercomputer at 25.9%. However, winning just 51 points from their opening 24 games – 11 points fewer than at this stage last season – those chances now stand at just 0.4%, meaning that across the current 10,000 season simulations by the supercomputer, they ended up coming back to win the title just 400 times. Even that feels generous when considering their current state. Head coach Xavi has already announced he’ll depart the club in the summer, with numerous replacements linked to Barcelona for this summer. The biggest success story of the season in Spain has undoubtedly been Girona. They may have lost to Real Madrid this weekend and now trail them by five points at the top of the La Liga table, but they look set to qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season. There is currently a 10-point gap between themselves and fifth-place Athletic Club. Before a ball was kicked in La Liga this season, the Opta supercomputer simulated the campaign 10,000 times and saw Girona finish 11th place on average. They didn’t win the league title once across those simulations, and only finished inside the top four places 0.9% of the time. That prediction is obviously looking foolish now. Part of the City Football Group, Girona have benefitted from some smart recruitment, but a lot of their success comes from having an excellent man in the dugout – Míchel. Their current chance of winning the title is only 1.9%, and that dream looks over for now, but they can console themselves with a 97.1% chance of UCL football in 2024-25. That’ll see them become the 14th different club to represent Spain in the competition since it rebranded in 1992. Spanish clubs haven’t been too great in European competition overall this season, and that means it looks unlikely La Liga will be awarded an extra spot in the UEFA Champions League next season via their UEFA coefficient. This means that fifth place won’t be enough for a place in the competition and makes finishing within the top four even more important. Other than the aforementioned three clubs – Real Madrid (100% chance), Girona (97.1%) and Barcelona (87.8%) – the fight for UCL football next season looks to be between two clubs. That battle is currently heavily weighted in Atlético Madrid’s favour (83.9%) rather than current fifth-place side Athletic Club (29.0%). Those projections could have been a lot different had Athletic Club not failed to beat bottom-of-the-league Almería on Monday night – the UCL hopefuls only managed to draw 0-0 in a disappointing result for Ernesto Valverde’s side, when a win could have taken them level on points with Diego Simeone’s team. Still, their current projected chance of finishing inside the top four is much higher than the Opta supercomputer prediction from pre-season (6.1%). At the bottom, Almería have been historically awful this season. Their seven points after 24 games is the second fewest won by a team in the Spanish top flight after 24 games of a season – only Sporting Gijón in 1997-98 (six points) have done worse. As a result, they are as good as down in the Opta supercomputer’s eyes, with a 99.8% chance of being relegated this season. Granada are only six points ahead of them and seven points from safety, therefore being given a 94.0% chance of dropping into the second tier for next season. With 13 points from 24 games, this is their worst ever La Liga campaign across their 27 seasons as a top-flight club. The third and final relegation spot is only slightly more complicated according to the Opta supercomputer. Cádiz currently occupy 18th place in the table and they are being given a 72.8% chance of relegation as it stands. Celta Vigo aren’t safe, though, with them only three points above Cádiz. The supercomputer gives them a 16.0% chance of relegation at the moment. Other outside contenders include Mallorca (7.3%), Rayo Vallecano (3.8%), Sevilla (3.7%) and Alavés (1.5%), while something would have to go dramatically wrong for Villarreal (0.9%) to be dragged in. It was Alavés (41.7%) who were the pre-season favourites for relegation, so their current 10-point lead over 18th-place Cádiz should be applauded, while Las Palmas were the second favourites for the drop before the season began (41.5%). They are having a great season so far, placed in eighth and are now outside contenders for European qualification in one of the top six spots of the league come the end of 2023-24 (4.8%). • Opta’s League Prediction model estimates the likelihood of teams finishing in each position in the competition.

We look ahead to Paris Saint-Germain vs Real Sociedad with our prediction and preview. Paris Saint-Germain must banish their UEFA Champions League last-16 demons if Luis Enrique’s side are to deliver their main ambition of European success, starting with the first leg of their round-of-16 tie against Real Sociedad at Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Paris, the so-called city of love, will fittingly play host to the European encounter on Valentine’s Day, though the mood in the French capital could quickly turn to misery if the Ligue 1 giants fall short of expectations yet again in the first knockout round of the Champions League. After defeat to Bayern Munich in the 2020 final and being eliminated by Manchester City in the 2021 semi-finals, PSG have been not made it past the round-of-16 stage in either of the last two seasons of UEFA’s premier club competition. A woeful second-leg collapse against Real Madrid proved their undoing in 2021-22 before falling to Bayern once again in 2022-23. Luis Enrique’s team almost missed out on last-16 qualification entirely this time around, failing to win any of their last three group games as they drew with Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle United after losing 2-1 away to Milan in early November. Somehow, PSG still scraped through Group F in second place, overcoming Stefano Pioli’s Rossoneri by virtue of their favourable head-to-head record. It could have been so different, with Luis Enrique’s future at the club most likely in danger if Milan had lost at Newcastle on the final group-stage matchday. Now, the French champions must look to capitalise on their good fortune. They’ll fancy their chances against Real Sociedad come Wednesday’s kick-off despite their three-game winless run in the Champions League being their longest in one campaign since going five without a win between Matchday 6 and the quarter-finals in 2014-15 (D2 L3). The success of PSG may be influenced by the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos – as well as teenage star Warren Zaïre-Emery – but the burden will largely fall on Real Madrid target Kylian Mbappé. The France star has scored 43 goals in 67 appearances in the Champions League and, should he find the net in this game, he will overtake Raúl (43) for the second-most goals scored in the competition while 25 or under, with only Lionel Messi (59) netting more. As for team news, PSG will be without the injured Nuno Mendes, Layvin Kurzawa, Presnel Kimpembe, Milan Skriniar and\\xa0backup goalkeeper Sergio Rico. They used their 3-1 victory over Lille on Saturday to rest Mbappé, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Marquinhos, with the trio all expected to return for Wednesday’s game. While PSG’s hopes mainly rest on French superstar Mbappé, La Real have also relied on their own countrymen, with all seven of their goals in the Champions League this season scored by Spanish players. Brais Méndez (3), Mikel Oyarzabal (2), Mikel Merino and Ander Barrenetxea (both one) helped propel them to the Champions League knockouts for the first time since 2003-04. Back then, La Real were eliminated by Lyon after making the last 16 in what was their first and only previous appearance in the Champions League knockouts before this season. Their performance in the group stage may provide Imanol Alguacil’s men with the belief they can pull off an upset against PSG. They went unbeaten to top Group D ahead of Inter after two wins over Benfica, victory over Red Bull Salzburg and three draws. Their success was at least partly down to their bold and aggressive approach off the ball, with no side making more high turnovers than their 70 in the competition this term, while only PSG have a lower PPDA average (opposition passes per defensive action) than Alguacil’s team (9.6), which highlights how high up the pitch they press teams. However, Alguacil may be without a few key figures from his lineup on Wednesday. Oyarzabal, Sheraldo Becker,\\xa0Álvaro Odriozola,\\xa0Kieran Tierney,\\xa0Aihen Muñoz\\xa0and\\xa0Carlos Fernández\\xa0all missed Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to Osasuna in La Liga. Club captain Oyarzabal was the biggest miss and remains a doubt for Wednesday, though Hamari Traoré and\\xa0Takefusa Kubo\\xa0have both started since their respective returns from the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup. Aritz Elustondo is suspended. This is the first ever competitive meeting between PSG and La Real, though the Ligue 1 club have been eliminated on five of the last six occasions they’ve faced Spanish opposition in the Champions League knockout rounds. PSG’s only success against teams from Spain came when eliminating Barcelona in the 2020-21 round of 16, with Mbappé’s hat-trick inspiring a 4-1 first-leg victory that teed up their 5-2 aggregate triumph in March 2021. The France forward is the last player to manage a treble against a Spanish side in the knockout stages of the competition and has netted in each of his last five Champions League matches with La Liga teams, scoring seven times. While PSG have struggled against Spanish opposition in recent years, La Real have also lost three of their six meetings with French opponents in all competitions (W2 D1), while they’ve lost both such games in the Champions League – going down 1-0 in both legs of a last-16 tie against Lyon in 2003-04. Real Sociedad kept more clean sheets (four), conceded fewer goals (two) and faced fewer shots on target (12) than any other side in this year’s Champions League group stage. Alguacil’s side may have fended off Inter, Salzburg and Benfica but their form has not translated to La Liga, where they sit seventh in the league table, 11 points adrift of fourth-placed Atlético Madrid and qualification for next season’s Champions League. Unlike Wednesday’s visitors, PSG are – unsurprisingly – cruising at the Ligue 1 summit, sitting 11 points clear of second-placed Nice as the French champions appear set to defend their title with ease. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: Despite Real Sociedad’s commendable performance in the group stage, the Opta supercomputer sees PSG as considerable favourites for this one, with the Parisians winning 55% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations. Nevertheless, the prediction model calculates a reasonable possibility that La Real take a positive result back to Anoeta, doing so in 45% of the simulations, odds that Alguacil will presumably like the look of. An away win is rated as having a 21.3% probability, and what a boost that would be for Real Sociedad if they’re able to pull it off. PSG struggled their way out of the group stage but their chances of winning the competition have risen to 6.4% in the Opta supercomputer’s season projections. That makes Luis Enrique’s side sixth favourites behind Inter, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City. PSG progressed to the quarter-finals in 64.5% of the last-16 simulations, making La Real big underdogs for this tie.

We look ahead to Wednesday’s UEFA Champions League action with our data-powered Lazio vs Bayern Munich prediction and preview. Bayern Munich are not a club accustomed to a lack of success, and with their 11-year stranglehold on the Bundesliga title now in grave peril, manager Thomas Tuchel is under severe pressure. Should Bayern fall short on the domestic front, winning the UEFA Champions League may be the only way for Tuchel to keep hold of his job. Can his under-fire side navigate a way through their last-16 tie against Lazio?\\xa0 Bayern were well beaten 3-0 by title rivals Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday as Xabi Alonso’s men proved beyond all doubt that they are the real deal. The sight of Bayern loanee Josip Stanisic scoring against his parent club will have rankled the visitors, even before second-half goals from Álex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong made it comfortable. The Opta supercomputer now rates Bayern’s hopes of a 12th straight Bundesliga crown at just 26.5%, compared to Leverkusen’s 73.4%. Tuchel now cannot afford to oversee an early European exit, but there are few teams more well-versed in navigating the Champions League’s knockout rounds than Bayern. Indeed, Bayern have progressed from 11 of their last 12 Champions League last-16 ties, with the exception coming against eventual champions Liverpool in 2018-19. Bayern have also avoided defeat in the first leg of 11 straight round-of-16 ties, with seven wins and four draws. For all their struggles on the domestic front, Bayern breezed through the Champions League group stage, recording five wins and one draw to beat FC Copenhagen, Galatasaray and Manchester United to top spot in Group A. The form of Harry Kane was a major factor in their success, with the England captain recording more goal involvements than any other player in the Champions League’s group stage this season (seven – four goals, three assists). Only in 2017-18 (nine) has the former Tottenham striker contributed to more goals in a single campaign in the competition. While Kane is Bayern’s undisputed talisman, Tuchel can also call upon an exiting backup option in Mathys Tel, with the 18-year-old being directly involved in three goals as a substitute in the group stage, scoring twice and assisting once in just 54 minutes. Since records began in 2003-04, no Bayern player has managed more goal involvements as a substitute in a single Champions League campaign. Tel could have a role to play in Wednesday’s first leg against Lazio, with injuries sidelining fellow attackers Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry. Bayern responded to their injury absences by bringing the arrival of Spanish winger Bryan Zaragoza forward to January, though he was unavailable through illness against Leverkusen. Fellow new arrivals Eric Dier and Sacha Boey failed to impress in that game and face a battle to remain in the starting lineup. Lazio have also underwhelmed domestically this term, sitting eighth in Serie A and five points adrift of the top four. However, Maurizio Sarri’s men appear to have turned a corner by winning five of their last seven league games, triumphing 3-1 at Cagliari on Saturday, and they will view this tie as something of a free hit. The Biancocelesti are making just their third appearance in the Champions League knockout stage, having lost both of their previous such ties. They were eliminated by Valencia in the quarter-finals of the 1999-00 tournament, before succumbing to Bayern at this stage three years ago. Their hopes of springing a surprise may rest upon the shoulders of captain Ciro Immobile, who scored three of Lazio’s seven goals as they finished as runners-up to Atlético Madrid in Group E. Overall, Immobile has eight goals in 11 Champions League appearances for Lazio, with only Simone Inzaghi scoring more for the club (15 in 31 appearances). Meanwhile, of all players to have netted at least five times in the competition for Lazio, Immobile has the best minutes-per-goal ratio, averaging a goal every 99 minutes.  Boss Sarri is known as an idealist, but if his team are to really test Bayern, a dose of pragmatism may be required. Lazio have averaged 165 pressures in the final third per Champions League game this season, the most of any side in the competition. However, they have only recovered possession in the final third 26 times, ranking 26th among the 32 teams to compete in the group stage. The only previous meetings between Lazio and Bayern came in the 2020-21 edition of the Champions League, with Bayern winning both legs of a last-16 tie. On that occasion, the Bavarians won 4-1 at the Stadio Olimpico before triumphing 2-1 in the reverse fixture in Germany. Bayern have a strong record against Italian sides more generally, winning their last five Champions League matches against Serie A opponents and going unbeaten through their last 12 since losing 3-2 at home to Inter in March 2011. Indeed, having been eliminated from four of their first five Champions League knockout ties against Italian clubs (including losing the 2010 final to Inter), Bayern have progressed from each of their last three. While Lazio have been inconsistent for much of 2023-24, they tend to fare well at the Stadio Olimpico. Indeed, the Biancocelesti have only lost one of their last 15 home games across all competitions (10 wins, four draws), going down 2-0 to Inter in Serie A in December.\\xa0 Bayern, though, won all three of their away games en route to topping Group A before Christmas, beating Copenhagen 2-1, Galatasaray 3-1 and Man Utd 1-0. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Tuchel needs a response after seeing his side dismantled by Leverkusen on Saturday, and the Opta supercomputer expects the Bayern boss to get one. Across 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of Wednesday’s first leg, Bayern are victorious in 56.7% of scenarios. Lazio are given a 20.3% chance of victory on home soil, with 23% of simulations finishing level.\\xa0 Overall, Bayern’s chances of winning the tie are rated at 79.3%, with Man City (93.9%) the only team seen as more likely to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. In the supercomputer’s tournament predictions, Bayern are given a 10.1% chance of becoming European champions for a seventh time, making them fourth favourites behind City (32.1%), Real Madrid (15.5%) and Inter (11.6%).  Lazio are given just a 0.45% chance of lifting the trophy, with only Copenhagen (0.05%) seen as bigger outsiders.

Brahim Díaz’s fine solo goal was the difference, with Leipzig enduring a frustrating night in front of goal. ●\\xa0Real Madrid have won each of their last seven UEFA Champions League games, their best winning streak since they strung together 10 victories between April 2014 and February 2015. ●\\xa0RB Leipzig are now without a clean sheet in each of their last 14 UEFA Champions League home games, since a 2-0 win over Istanbul Basaksehir in October 2020 in the group stages. ●\\xa0Real Madrid enjoyed their fifth victory in their last six away knockout games against German opposition in the UEFA Champions League (L1), after managing just one win in their previous 17 in the Champions League/European Cup (D4 L12). ●\\xa0Despite losing, RB Leipzig directed nine shots on target in the game, their most ever in a UEFA Champions League knockout game, while it’s the most Real Madrid have faced in the competition since the 2022 final against Liverpool (also 9). ●\\xa0RB Leipzig attacker Benjamin Sesko directed four shots on target in the game, with only two players managing more in a UEFA Champions League game this season (Julián Alvarez for Manchester City v Crvena Zvezda and Erling Haaland for the Citizens against Young Boys, both five). ●\\xa0Brahim Díaz has registered three goal involvements (2 goals, 1 assist) in his last four UEFA Champions League appearances, one more than he managed in his previous 14 (2). ●\\xa0Dani Carvajal’s assist for Brahim Díaz was the second time two Spaniards have combined for a goal in the UEFA Champions League this season for Real Madrid (also Fran García’s assist for Joselu v Union Berlin), as many times as in the previous four seasons in the competition combined. ●\\xa0Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior (23y & 216d) made his 50th UEFA Champions League appearance, becoming the fifth-youngest player to reach this milestone in the competition’s history after Iker Casillas (22y & 155d), Cesc Fàbregas (22y & 331d), Kylian Mbappé (22y & 339d) and Lionel Messi (23y & 166d).

Our latest edition includes numbers on the UEFA Champions League, Rasmus Højlund, and headed goals. It feels like showing patience is becoming a dying art. If our coffee order is taking too long it’s the end of the world; if the traffic lights take ages to change it ruins our day; if our Valentine’s Day card doesn’t arrive on time it means we’re unlovable and must dive headfirst into the nearest tub of ice cream and please take me back Sharon, I promise I’ll stop writing rude words in your Sudoku puzzles… ahem. Manchester United have been rewarded for showing patience. Not long ago you didn’t have to go far to find people questioning Rasmus Højlund’s credentials, but he achieved something this weekend that only one player in Premier League history has been able to match at a younger age. We’ll investigate his improvement further. We also have an\\xa0Ask Opta\\xa0query about headers, so we’ll use our own noggins to try and answer that. Let’s start with the UEFA Champions League with the round of 16 getting under way this week, though we’re looking a bit beyond that. If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week.  The music can be heard in the distance. That can only mean one thing. “The Chaaaaampions!” Yes, the Champions League is back as the 2023-24 knockout stage is upon us. As things stand, this will be the last iteration of the competition in its current form, with more teams and more games in the revised format from next season. That means more qualifying spots, and unless you haven’t been paying attention, you’ll know that European leagues are now vying for extra entries into the 2024-25 Champions League. The number of participants will go up from 32 to 36 teams from 2024-25, with one additional spot being given to the association in fifth place in the country coefficient rankings, another to the ‘champions path’ qualifiers, which winners of domestic leagues without a direct group stage entry contest each year, and two additional spots will be handed to the associations with the best collective European performance in the previous season. Yes,\\xa0coefficients are the name of the game. It means teams from each country can boost their nation’s chances of an extra Champions League spot. Imagine the scenes if Manchester City winning the tournament again directly leads to Manchester United qualifying for it next season. As things stand, it’s looking good for the Premier League. The performances of English teams in the qualification rounds and the group stages of the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League means there is currently a 77.0% chance of fifth place in England’s top flight this season being enough for a Champions League place, according to the Opta supercomputer. That is ahead of Italy (50.4%), Germany (48.3%), Spain (12.5%) and France (9.9%). If fans of Tottenham, Aston Villa, Man Utd and Newcastle weren’t already cheering on their Premier League rivals in Europe before, they should be now. Villa can help their own cause by winning the Europa Conference League, though hopefully for Unai Emery’s side it won’t be at the expense of their league form. Just when you thought the Champions League couldn’t get more interesting. You might even see Barcelona fans cheering on Real Madrid or Borussia Dortmund supporters urging Bayern Munich to glory… so keep an eye out for flying pigs or cold weather in Hell. Rasmus Højlund arrived at Manchester United to much fanfare in the summer. The young Dane was supposed to finally be the number nine to fire the Red Devils back into Premier League title contention. Predictably, given he only turned 21 earlier this month, it has taken Højlund time to find his feet. He scored an impressive five goals in the Champions League group stage but was finding the task of beating goalkeepers far trickier in the Premier League. Up to Christmas, Højlund had played 945 Premier League minutes for United without scoring or assisting (14 games, 11 starts). His goalless streak extended beyond 1,000 minutes during the home clash with Aston Villa on 26 December, but in the 82nd minute of that game, he not only finally found the net in league action, but he also won the game in a dramatic 3-2 comeback at Old Trafford. That moment appears to have rejuvenated his confidence. The former Atalanta striker has scored in subsequent league appearances against Tottenham, Wolves, West Ham and Villa. Since Christmas, Højlund has managed five goals and two assists in just 442 minutes. In doing so, aged 21 years and seven days, Højlund became the second youngest player ever to score in five successive Premier League appearances, only behind Nicolas Anelka for Arsenal in November 1998 (19y 239d). His efficiency in front of goal has skyrocketed in that time, unsurprisingly. He had taken 18 shots in the Premier League before Man Utd’s first win over Villa without scoring, but has had just eight shots since, finding the net five times. The sky appears to be the limit for Højlund, until he goes a few games without a goal again and ‘#FraudmasFraudlund’ starts trending. Each of the traditional big six in the Premier League won on Matchday 24, while there were some notable results elsewhere. Let’s test your knowledge of it all with our weekly quiz. Answers at the bottom of the page. 1.\\xa0Kevin De Bruyne provided yet another assist for Erling Haaland in Manchester City’s 2-0 win over Everton. The Belgian has provided the most assists of any Premier League player for a specific teammate (Haaland) in all competitions since the start of last season.

Who did they play in that game?\\xa0A)\\xa0Oldham Athletic,\\xa0B)\\xa0Southampton, or\\xa0C)\\xa0Swindon Town? 3.\\xa0Nine of Diogo Jota’s 40 league goals for Liverpool have been headers. Since his first season at the Reds in 2020-21, only two Premier League players have more headed goals in the competition. Who? 4.\\xa0Brennan Johnson’s late goal against Brighton was Tottenham’s third 90+ minute winner in the Premier League this season (also vs Sheffield United and Liverpool). Who are the only other team to have scored as many? 5.\\xa0Gabriel Magalhães was among the goals in Arsenal’s 6-0 thrashing of West Ham. The Brazilian defender has scored 14 goals for the Gunners in the Premier League, the most of any defender in the competition since the start of 2020-21. Overall, who is the only defender to have recorded more goals for Arsenal in the Premier League? This week’s question came to us on X from Mike Mander (@ynwa2808), who asks:\\xa0“All four goals in the Liverpool vs Burnley game were headers. It got me wondering, what is the highest score where the goals have just all been headers?” Do you have a stat-based question you’d like Opta to answer in a future edition of SVQ? Email us at\\xa0editors@theanalyst.com\\xa0or message us on X\\xa0@OptaAnalyst\\xa0with #AskOpta and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: Indeed, everyone was using their heads on Saturday as Liverpool beat Burnley 3-1 at Anfield, with all four goals coming from headers. Diogo Jota and Dara O’Shea both nodded in from corners to make it 1-1 at the break, before Luis Díaz reacted well to head in Harvey Elliott’s deflected cross and Darwin Núñez superbly glanced an effort in from another Elliott ball. It moved the game level with four others from Premier League history that have had the highest number of exclusively headed goals. Liverpool already jointly held the record, rather unwantedly, from their 3-1 home defeat to Manchester United in the 1996-97 season, while Burnley also now appear twice in the list having previously featured in a game with four headed goals, a 2-2 draw with West Brom in the 2014-15 campaign. Derby County were participants in the two remaining games with four goals that all came via heads, a 4-0 home defeat to Leicester in April 1998 – with all the goals arriving in the first 15 minutes of the game – and a 2-2 draw away at Wimbledon in September 1999. Another notable thing from Saturday’s game is that Liverpool more than doubled their headed goals total in the Premier League this season from it. Prior to that contest, the Reds had scored just two headers in the league, with only one coming in their first 21 league games of the 2023-24 campaign (Mohamed Salah vs Brentford). Dominik Szoboszlai also scored with his head in the recent 4-1 win over Chelsea.

The two most high-profile players in Europe over the last 30 years have been Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and they have been battling it out to be both the top scorer and the top creator in the Champions League. A small cottage industry has sprung up over the debate over who the GOAT is, but while everyone knows how many goals those two players have scored in Europe’s premier competition, until now nobody knew whether one of them or someone else had the most assists because no source has all assists counted back to the date that the European Cup became the Champions League. Thanks to our team’s relentless investigative skills and diligent research, Opta can exclusively reveal the player with the most assists in Champions League history, and it isn’t Messi or Ronaldo… though they do come very close. Opta has the most widely used definition of assists. We don’t count penalties won, or award assists for goals after saves, rebounds or significant deflections. We thoroughly check slow-motion videos and official reports to compile the most consistent and accurate database on the planet and, unlike some sources, our definition does not change season to season or competition to competition. There are eight players with 30 or more assists in the competition. The first player to reach 10 goal assists was Zinedine Zidane. Long before Messi and Ronaldo were dominating the Ballon D’Or, the Frenchman was the top creator and best player in Europe. Zizou was also the first player to reach 20 assists, on both occasions pipping David Beckham to the milestone.  The former captains of England and France battled each other at the top of the charts while playing for Man Utd and Juventus and then while in the same team as part of Real Madrid’s Galacticos. One third of Beckham’s assists came from dead-ball situations while only 16% of Zidane’s were from free-kicks or corners. But Zidane doesn’t even make the top 10, coming in joint 12th in the ranking. Beckham fared a little better, though. So, who are the top five all-time players for goal assists in the Champions League? The Argentine winger has played in five of Europe’s top seven leagues according to the current UEFA rankings and is the top creator still active in the competition, with his first Champions League assist coming for Benfica against Celtic back in October 2007. A successful spell at the Portuguese club earned him a transfer to Real Madrid where he spent four seasons, culminating in a Champions League winners medal in 2013-14 after beating city rivals Atlético in the final. A one-year spell at Manchester United saw him miss a season in the competition as David Moyes’ side had finished seventh the previous year, but he helped United to qualify for the following season’s Champions League with 10 assists in the Premier League. However, Di María moved on to Paris Saint-Germain, where he recorded 18 of his 36 Champions League assists, setting up Kylian Mbappé more times than he had any other player in his career (five times). Di María then added three assists in the competition for Juventus, before returning to Benfica in the 2023 summer transfer window. With his assist for Rafa against RB Salzburg on MD 6 of the 2023-24 competition, he moved level with David Beckham in the rankings. Can he move further up the list? That remains to be seen. David Beckham is arguably the best set-piece expert the Champions League has ever seen. He was an integral part of Manchester United’s treble-winning team and held the record for assists in the competition until 2011. Only Luis Figo has more assists from dead-ball situations than the current owner of Inter Miami, who linked up with (spoiler alert!) one of the top three creators after his club signed Lionel Messi from PSG. Beckham’s first assist came when he set up Roy Keane in 1994 against Galatasaray, and he ended with 29 assists for the Red Devils before leaving the Premier League and adding seven more during his stint at Real Madrid. Dwight Yorke was the main beneficiary of the Englishman’s pinpoint crossing and passing, scoring six goals from Beckham’s deliveries. No player in the history of the Champions League has assisted more headed goals than Beckham, with 18 of the goals he created being nodded home. Lionel Messi had to wait until his sixth Champions League appearance to open his account for both goals and assists. His first goal and assist came against Panathinaikos in a 5-0 win at the Camp Nou in 2005-06, as Messi pounced to score Barcelona’s third goal after a defensive mix-up, and then set up Samuel Eto’o’s hat-trick goal to make it 5-0. His final assist in the competition, meanwhile, was for an Mbappé goal against Juventus, which came just six weeks before the two players starred in the epic 2022 World Cup final. Meanwhile, the player assisted by Messi the most in the Champions League was Neymar, with five, four of which came at Barcelona plus one more at PSG. It’s a little-known fact that Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score in his first 26 Champions League matches. At that stage of his career, most people would naturally have seen him as a creator rather than goalscorer. In his 27th appearance, against Roma, he had already laid on a goal for Michael Carrick to register his sixth assist in the competition when he scored twice himself in a 7-1 rout. The Portuguese legend then developed into a goal machine rather than a creator; he registered just two assists in his final 25 Champions League games while scoring 19 goals in the same span of time. His first ever assist came against Lyon in 2004-05, and they were the opponent he managed to register the most assists against. Ronaldo has the most goal involvements in Champions League finals with five, with his one assist coming as Real Madrid won the title in 2013-14. Longevity and ability are two key factors in breaking any record, and Ryan Giggs had both. He spent 20 years in the Champions League, including one as player/coach, and he won the trophy twice. Perhaps the most important of his assists came at a particularly crucial time – in the 1999 Champions League final. With United on the verge of defeat, he mishit a shot from the edge of the box that Teddy Sheringham poked home to equalise and set up the dramatic denouement, which led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s winner just a minute later. Giggs also assisted United’s goal in the 2009 final defeat to Barcelona, and is therefore one of seven players to assist a goal in two separate finals, while he is behind only Andrés Iniesta, who assisted a goal in three finals. Giggs’ final assist came against Bayer Leverkusen in November 2013, and he is one of just five players who have assisted four goals in a single Champions League game, which the Welsh wing wizard managed in the aforementioned 7-1 win over Roma in 2007. The player he assisted most often was Wayne Rooney, who reaped the benefit of six Giggs assists. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Erling Haaland became just the third player to score five goals in a single UCL game in March 2023, after Lionel Messi and Luiz Adriano. Lionel Messi became the first player to score five goals in a single UEFA Champions League game with an exceptional performance against Bayer Leverkusen in March 2012.Barca came into the second leg of this last-16 tie with a 3-1 lead, thanks in part to Messi himself, who grabbed the third away goal in the first leg win in Germany. There was no doubt that he was the star in this 7-1 victory at the Camp Nou, though. This remains the only club game in Messi’s career in which he’s scored five goals, while they came as part of his record-breaking 2011-12 season at Barcelona. That campaign saw him score a frightening 73 goals in 60 appearances – the most he’s scored in a single season at club level. Whilst he was the first player to score five in a game in the Champions League era (since 1992), he wasn’t the first to do so in the history of the European Cup overall. \\xa0Here are the 10 players to have scored five goals in a single European Cup match: Owe Ohlsson – IFK Göteborg vs. Linfield – 23 September 1959Bent Löfqvist – B1913 vs. Spora Luxembourg – 13 September 1961Altafini – Milan vs. Union Luxembourg – 12 September 1962Raymond Crawford – Ipswich Town vs. Floriana FC – 25 September 1962Nikola Kotkov – Lokomotiv Sofia vs. Malmö FF – 10 September 1964Flórián Albert -Ferencváros vs. Keflavík IF – 8 September 1965Paul Van Himst – RSC Anderlecht vs. Haka – 14 September 1966Gerd Müller – Bayern Munich vs. Omonia Nicosia – 24 September 1972Claudio Sulser – Grasshopper Club Zürich vs. Valletta FC – 13 September 1978Søren Lerby – Ajax vs. Omonia Nicosia – 24 October 1979 Two and a half years after Messi’s five-goal haul in the Champions League, Luiz Adriano became the second player to score five in a single UCL match. The Brazilian forward scored five goals in Shakhtar Donetsk’s 7-0 away demolition of BATE Borisov in the 2014-15 group stage, with four of those arriving before half-time. The Shakhtar star also scored a hat-trick in the home group stage game against the Belarusian side, meaning his eight goals overall that season against BATE are the most ever scored by one player against an opponent in a single UCL campaign. Erling Haaland’s ridiculous scoring record in his first season at Manchester City became even more ridiculous during their 7-0 drubbing of Bundesliga club RB Leipzig in March 2023, as the striker scored goals 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 of the 2022-23 campaign. The warning signs were there, with Haaland already having scored six times in all competitions against RB Leipzig – against no club had he scored more often – but he extended that tally to 11 with this five-goal haul. He not only became just the third player to score five goals in a single UCL match, but his performance took his overall tally in the competition to 33 in just 25 appearances, reaching the 30-goal milestone in fewer matches than any other player, while he also became the youngest player to reach 30 goals in the competition’s history (22y 236d). This was his fifth hat-trick of the 2022-23 season (of an eventual six), becoming the first player to score five hat-tricks for a Premier League club across all competitions within a single season since Harry Kane for Spurs in 2016-17. It also took his personal UCL goal tally to 10 for the 2022-23 campaign, which broke a Manchester City club record.  Another club record broken on the night was that of the single-season scoring record by a Manchester City player, with the Norwegian’s 39 goals overtaking the previous Man City record set by Tommy Johnson in 1928-29 (38 goals). He ultimately hit 52 in 53 games across the campaign. Haaland would have probably added to his five-goal tally had manager Pep Guardiola not taken him off in the 63rd minute of the game, as the striker was at his very best. He scored his five goals from eight shots, with all eight of those shots finding the target. Marco van Basten became the first player to score a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League following its rebrand and change from the old European Cup. Not content with three goals, he added a fourth in Milan’s 4-0 win over Swedish club IFK Göteborg at San Siro. Here’s a great fact to tell your mates. The Dutchman is the only player to score a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League and the European Cup, having also scored four for Milan in October 1988 versus Levski Sofia. We had to wait over eight years before another player scored four goals in a single UEFA Champions League match, with Simone Inzaghi ending the competition drought with a four-goal performance for Lazio against French club Marseille in March 2000. Unlike his brother Filippo (twice), Simone Inzaghi never won the Champions League, nor did he play as many games in the competition (81 vs. 31) or score as many goals (46 vs. 15) – but he did score four goals in a UCL match, something Filippo never did despite scoring three hat-tricks. At the time, Monaco’s 8-3 win over Deportivo de La Coruña in November 2003 broke the record as the highest-scoring Champions League game of all time. That record has since been lost to Borussia Dortmund 8-4 Legia Warsaw in November 2016, but unlike this game, it didn’t produce a four-goal performance from a single player. Long-haired Croatian striker Dado Prso scored half of Monaco’s eight goals (four), with all of them coming before the 50th minute, including a first-half hat-trick. Prso’s four goals in this match contributed 44% of his all-time Champions League goal tally (nine), while he only ever scored four more times in 12 UCL appearances after this performance in the principality. Amazingly, this game didn’t see any goals after the 67th minute – just think about how crazy the scoreline could have been if the rate of goals had lasted the full 90 minutes. Ruud van Nistelrooy became the first Manchester United player to score four goals in a Champions League or European Cup game since Denis Law in October 1968 versus Waterford. The Dutch striker scored all four of United’s goals in this match, just two weeks after they drew 0-0 with Sparta Prague in the away group game. These four goals helped van Nistelrooy reach eight in the 2004-05 group stage, but none in the knockout stages, as United lost to Milan in the last 16. However, this was still enough for him to finish as the competition’s top scorer that season. Andriy Shevchenko became the first player to score as many as four goals in a UEFA Champions League away game during Milan’s 4-0 victory at Fenerbahçe in November 2005. These four goals helped Shevchenko to the Champions League golden boot that season, eventually grabbing nine goals in 2005-06. Only one Milan player – Kaká versus Anderlecht in November 2006 – has scored a Champions League hat-trick since this treble by the Ukrainian. When Arsenal came from two goals down to draw 2-2 in the first leg of their 2009-10 quarter-final tie with Barcelona at the Emirates Stadium, they’d have been forgiven for thinking they were in with a chance of making the semis. Lionel Messi single-handedly ended those hopes, despite Arsenal taking a shock lead at the Camp Nou. The Argentine scored all four goals in this superb performance against the Gunners, with Messi completing his hat-trick before half-time. At 22 years and 286 days old on the day of this game, Messi was the youngest player to score at least four goals in a single UCL match, until Erling Haaland surpassed him in 2023 (22y 236d when he scored five vs RB Leipzig). Barcelona’s 6-3 aggregate win sent them through to a semi-final tie against Internazionale, which would be remembered for José Mourinho’s post-tie celebrations on the pitch at the Camp Nou after a tactical masterclass to knock Barca out. Bafétimbi Gomis’ four-goal haul for Lyon in their 7-1 rout at Dinamo Zagreb saw him become the first French player to score as many as four goals in a single Champions League/European Cup match since Lucien Cossou for Monaco in September 1963. Gomis only scored nine goals in the Champions League overall, with 44% of them coming in this match. He would only play once more in the competition after this, with these his final goals. Mario Gomez scored four times in Bayern Munich’s 7-0 last-16 win over Swiss club Basel in March 2012. You could argue that none of them were crucial as the German striker scored his side’s third, fourth, fifth and sixth goals in the win at the Allianz Arena on the night. Overall, Gomez scored 12 UCL goals for Bayern Munich in 2011-12 and was only beaten to the top scorer award by Lionel Messi (14). At the time, this was the biggest win in the knockout stages of the Champions League, but it’s since been joined by another 7-0 by Bayern against Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2014-15 last-16 and Man City’s 7-0 victories over Schalke and RB Leipzig at the same stage of the 2018-19 and 2022-23 editions respectively. Robert Lewandowski put on a striking masterclass in April 2013, as he scored all four goals in Borussia Dortmund’s semi-final first leg 4-1 win over Real Madrid. In doing so, the Polish striker became the only player to ever score four goals in a semi-final match across the European Cup or Champions League, but it still doesn’t quite match the feat of Ferenc Puskás, who scored four goals in the 1960 European Cup final for Real Madrid against Eintracht Frankfurt. This victory was enough to see Borussia Dortmund through to the final, losing the second leg 2-0 in Madrid but winning 4-3 on aggregate. Jürgen\\xa0Klopp’s side went on to lose the final in London to Bayern Munich, while Lewandowski’s 10 goals were beaten by only Cristiano Ronaldo’s 12 in the 2012-13 edition of the competition. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored four of PSG’s five goals in a brilliant group stage away win at Belgian club Anderlecht in October 2013. The Swedish striker had wrapped up a fantastic hat-trick inside the opening 36 minutes of the game, before adding a fourth goal in the 62nd minute. He was a constant menace for the French side during the game, attempting 10 shots in total. These four strikes helped him to 10 goals across the entire 2013-14 Champions League season – double his tally in any other campaign, while only Cristiano Ronaldo (17) scored more in the competition that season. Cristiano Ronaldo might be the all-time leading goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history, but he’s only scored more than three goals in one game – that came in December 2015 against Malmö FF at the Santiago Bernabéu. Ronaldo’s four goals in this 2015-16 group stage match came from 10 shots – a tally he’s only surpassed in six of his Champions League appearances across his career. His strikes helped Real Madrid equal the Champions League record margin of victory in this game, level with Liverpool 8-0 Beşiktaş in November 2007 – both successful sides were managed by Rafael Benitez. Ronaldo eventually reached 16 goals overall in 2015-16 – the only player to hit double figures that season and six goals more than the next best, Robert Lewandowski. Former Arsenal player Serge Gnabry enjoyed himself on the home ground of rivals Spurs in October 2019, as his four goals helped Bayern Munich achieve an astonishing 7-2 win in London. Gnabry became only the second German player to score four goals in a Champions League match after Mario Gomez versus Basel in March 2012 (also for Bayern, 7-0 win). This was the only time in Tottenham’s 140-year history that they have ever conceded seven goals at home in any competition. Bayern’s 6-0 away win against Crvena Zvezda in November 2019 saw Robert Lewandowski become just the second player to score at least four goals in a single Champions League match on more than one occasion, after Lionel Messi. In scoring four goals across a period of just 14 minutes and 31 seconds, Lewandowski broke the record for the quickest four-goal haul in the history of the Champions League. Overall that season, Lewandowski scored 15 goals as Bayern ended as Champions League winners following victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final. Only Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more in a single UCL campaign – 17 in 2013-14 and 16 in 2015-16, both for Real Madrid. Josip Ilicic scored all four goals as Atalanta secured a historic 4-3 victory away at Valencia in March 2020. The Slovenian striker scored his two first-half goals from the penalty spot, before adding two more goals in the 71st and 82nd minute of the tie in Spain. Having won the first leg 4-1 at home, Atalanta were already in an excellent position to make their first-ever Champions League quarter-finals, but Ilicic made sure. He is the only player to score four goals with his left foot in a single UEFA Champions League match since the rebrand of the European Cup in 1992. Olivier Giroud rolled back the years with an exceptional performance for Chelsea in December 2020, scoring all four goals to defeat Sevilla in the group stage. This was only the second UCL hat-trick of the French striker’s career, following his three goals for Arsenal against Olympiakos in December 2015, also away from home. At 34 years and 63 days old, Giroud is the oldest player to score at least four goals in a UEFA Champions League match. Sébastien Haller started the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League group stage as he meant to go on, scoring four goals on his UCL debut. These four goals for Ajax at Sporting CP meant that he is one of only two players to score four times in his first appearance in the Champions League – the other being Marco van Basten, who’d already played in the European Cup. Overall, Haller scored 10 goals in six UCL group stage appearances across 2021-22, ending just one goal behind the record for group stage goals in a season by a player – Cristiano Ronaldo’s 11 in 2015-16.

We list all occasions that a team has won a match by a margin of at least seven goals since the rebranded European competition kicked off in 1992. Liverpool 8-0 Beşiktaş – 6 November 2007Real Madrid 8-0 Malmö FF – 8 December 2015 Juventus 7-0 Olympiakos – 10 December 2003Arsenal 7-0 Slavia Prague – 23 October 2007MSK Zilina 0-7 Marseille – 3 November 2010Valencia CF 7-0 KRC Genk – 23 November 2011Bayern Munich 7-0 Basel – 13 March 2012BATE Borisov 0-7 Shakhtar Donetsk – 21 October 2014Bayern Munich 7-0 Shakhtar Donetsk – 11 March 2015Barcelona 7-0 Celtic – 13 September 2016Maribor 0-7 Liverpool – 17 October 2017Liverpool 7-0 Spartak Moscow – 6 December 2017Manchester City 7-0 FC Schalke – 12 March 2019Manchester City 7-0 RB Leipzig – 14 March 2023 Liverpool became the first team in UEFA Champions League history to score eight goals as they put Turkish side Beşiktaş to the sword at Anfield in November 2007. Alongside Real Madrid’s victory over Malmö eight years later, this remains one of the two biggest Champions League wins. Two Peter Crouch goals bookended another six for the Reds, with Yossi Benayoun netting three of Liverpool’s eight goals in this win, becoming the first and so far, only Israeli player to score a treble in Europe’s top club competition. With six of Liverpool’s eight goals coming after half-time, they became the first team to score as many as six goals in the second half of a Champions League match – a feat that has only been replicated once since, in Lyon’s 7-1 demolition of Dinamo Zagreb in 2011. Rafael Benitez was in charge of Liverpool’s 8-0 win against Beşiktaş in 2007, and he did it again when in charge of Real Madrid eight years later. There are two outright biggest Champions League wins in history and the Spanish coach is responsible for orchestrating both of them. Not bad for a supposedly defensive manager. Cristiano Ronaldo (four) and Karim Benzema (three) scored seven of Real Madrid’s goals, with this being the only game in UCL history to see two different players score a hat-trick. Ronaldo’s strikes took him to a Champions League record tally of 11 in the group stage alone that season and helped him finish on 16 goals in 2015-16, a total only eclipsed by his own effort in 2013-14 (17). His record tally of group stage goals nearly went in 2021-22 to Sébastien Haller when he was still at Ajax, but the now Borussia Dortmund man fell one goal short (10) of Ronaldo’s tally (11) from 2015-16. For Malmö, this result followed a 4-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk and a 5-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain. Overall, they ended up conceding 21 goals in 2015-16 – the fifth-highest tally by a team in a Champions League group stage campaign. Real Madrid eventually went on to win the Champions League final in 2015-16 thanks to a penalty shootout victory over Atlético Madrid in Cardiff. Juventus thrashed Greek side Olympiakos 7-0 at Stadio delle Alpi in the 2003-04 Champions League group stage, with six different players helping themselves to goals on the night for the side from Italy. Over half of the goals that Olympiakos conceded in the competition that season (54%) arrived in this single match, but it meant little for the Serie A club in the end as they were knocked out in the next round with a last 16 defeat to Deportivo La Coruña over two legs (2-0). This game saw an English side score seven goals in a Champions League match for the second time, following Manchester United’s 7-1 win over Roma in the 2006-07 quarter-finals. Theo Walcott scored twice – his first two goals in the Champions League, and he remains the youngest English player to score a brace in the competition at 18 years, 221 days old. Only Jude Bellingham, Jadon Sancho (both for Borussia Dortmund) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have netted a goal while younger than Walcott in the UCL of all Englishmen. This match was the final victory in a sequence of 12 successive wins for Arsenal in all competitions (which included a Premier League win over rivals Tottenham), but what a way to end it. Marseille became the first team to score seven goals away from home in a Champions League match in November 2010, as they hammered Slovakian side MŠK Žilina. They remain the only French club to score seven times in a single game in the competition. André-Pierre Gignac scored a hat-trick for Marseille, becoming just the fourth Frenchman at the time to net three in a Champions League match after Sylvain Wiltord, Thierry Henry and Franck Sauzée – the latter also doing so for OM. MŠK Žilina lost all six of their games in the competition that season, with a goal difference of -16. This defeat certainly didn’t help. No Slovak side has appeared in the Champions League since. KRC Genk opened up their 2011-12 UEFA Champions League campaign with a solid 0-0 draw at home to Valencia, but suffered a disastrous defeat in the return match just two months later. La Liga side Valencia put seven past the Belgian club without reply, with three of those coming in the first half via Roberto Soldado. The Spanish striker scored a hat-trick within 39 minutes, which at the time was the fourth earliest hat-trick scored in the competition’s history. Despite this victory, Valencia still exited at the group stage of the competition in 2011-12, finishing behind Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea. Scoring only five goals in their other five games certainly didn’t help. Bayern Munich followed up a 7-1 victory over Hoffenheim in the German Bundesliga with another seven-goal hammering just three days earlier. Mario Gomez scored three in that league win but went one better in this Champions League fixture and became the first German player to score four goals in a single match in the history of the competition. This was the first time that a team had scored as many as seven goals in a knockout stage game of the Champions League and was the second leg of a tie that Basel were leading 1-0 following a meeting in Switzerland. Bayern went on to reach the final that season but lost on penalties to Chelsea in their home stadium. This game was over by half-time, with Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk leading 6-0 at the break and becoming the first and so far, only, team in Champions League history to score six goals in the opening 45 minutes of a game. Luiz Adriano helped himself to four of these and added his fifth and Shakhtar’s seventh in the second half, with the Brazilian becoming just the second player to score five times in a single UCL match after Lionel Messi. BATE Borisov navigated their way past three qualifying rounds to reach the Champions League proper, but it was a pretty miserable group stage for the Belarusian side. The seven goals in this game contributed towards a total of 24 conceded by BATE in 2014-15 – no team has ever conceded more in a Champions League group campaign. It would be a pretty impressive feat to both score seven goals and concede seven goals within two separate games in the same Champions League season, but Shakhtar Donetsk did just that as they got a taste of their own medicine in Munich.  After sealing one of the biggest Champions League wins against BATE Borisov in the groups (7-0), the Ukrainians suffered a defeat by the same score against Bayern Munich in the last 16. After drawing 0-0 in the first leg, Bayern were on fire in the second leg with six different players getting on the scoresheet. Olexandr Kucher received the quickest red card in competition history for a third-minute foul, which then saw Thomas Müller net the resulting penalty. Bayern hit 25 shots with 13 on target in this win and eventually progressed past Porto in the quarter-finals before losing in the semi-finals to Pep Guardiola’s former side Barcelona. Barcelona put on a show in front of their own fans at the Camp Nou in this group stage meeting with Celtic in September 2016. Lionel Messi scored three of the seven goals on this evening – his sixth of eight Champions League trebles with his seventh coming just a month later against Manchester City. Messi opened the scoring in the third minute, but Celtic had a chance to equalise in the 24th minute via a Moussa Dembele penalty, but it was saved by Marc-André ter Stegen on a miserable night in Spain for the Scottish side. One of the major reasons for this win was the exceptional performance of Neymar. He scored once and assisted four more in this single match, with his five goal involvements being more than any other player in a Champions League game in 2016-17. Liverpool’s 7-0 away win against Slovenia side Maribor was the biggest win away from home by an English team in the history of the Champions League or European Cup. This was also the biggest away win by an English club away from home in a Europe competition since Arsenal defeated Standard Liege 7-0 in the Cup Winners’ Cup in November 1993. Both Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah scored braces for the Premier League side, with Liverpool becoming just the fifth team to score as many as seven goals in a single Champions League away game. Liverpool enjoyed another 7-0 win in the 2017-18 Champions League group stage, less than two months after the same result away in Slovenia. These two results helped the Reds score 23 goals in the groups that season, the third-highest tally in a single UCL season. Of the 13 biggest Champions League wins by a margin of at least seven goals, Liverpool are responsible for three of them. Philippe Coutinho scored a hat-trick in this victory, which ensured qualification to the knockout stages for Jürgen Klopp’s side. This 7-0 loss meant that Spartak Moscow had to make do with Europa League football post-Christmas in 2017-18. Liverpool went all the way to the Champions League final but finished as runners-up after losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in Kyiv, remembered mainly for Gareth Bale’s wonderful overhead kick and that Loris Karius error. Schalke 04? Schalke 07, more like. The German side were completely outclassed in the second leg of this last 16 tie in the 2018-19 edition of the competition, after previously losing the first leg 3-2 at home. City won 10-2 on aggregate to qualify for the quarter finals. Only once before had a team won by a larger margin in the Champions League knockout stages: Bayern Munich 12-1 Sporting CP in the 2008-09 last 16. One of the goals on this night came from Phil Foden, who bagged his first goal in the competition and in doing so, became City’s youngest scorer in the competition (18y, 288d) while Leroy Sané grabbed a goal and three assists. Nearly four years to the day of their 7-0 rout of Schalke, Manchester City fancied inflicting another thrashing on a Bundesliga club. RB Leipzig were the unlucky recipients, this time. Erling Haaland scored five of Man City’s goals in the game, and it could have been more had Pep Guardiola not taken the striker off after 63 minutes. He scored his five goals from eight shots, with all of those being on target. It was Haaland’s fifth of six hat-tricks that season in all competitions and took his seasonal goal tally to a quite ridiculous 39 in 36 games. In reaching 39, he broke the Manchester City club record for goals in a single season, overtaking Tommy Johnson’s 38-goal effort from 1928-29. He ended the 2022-23 campaign with 52 goals in 53 games overall. German international Ilkay Gündogan and Kevin De Bruyne added goals for City to take their tally to seven and complete an utterly miserable night for RB Leipzig. Enjoy this?

Here we give you the rundown of the highest scoring players across seasons in the history of the UCL. The greatest individual goalscoring season in UEFA Champions League history came in 2013-14, when Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo scored 17 times, making a huge contribution to their title win. Ronaldo started the season in the best way possible, scoring a hat-trick in Real Madrid’s 6-1 away win at Galatasaray on MD 1, before adding a further six goals in the group stage. He added further goals in the last 16 (four), quarter-final (one) and semi-final (two) before finishing off his campaign in style with a 120th minute strike to seal a 4-1 victory in the final against rivals Atlético Madrid. Cristiano Ronaldo was one goal away from equalling his own record of goals scored in a single Champions League season, when he scored 16 times in the 2015-16 campaign on the way to once again winning the competition with Real Madrid. The superstar forward scored 11 goals in the group stage of the 2015-16 edition, which is a record by a single player in a UEFA Champions League campaign. That tally was two more than the second-highest overall scorer in the competition in 2015-16; Robert Lewandowski (nine). Ronaldo yet again opened the season with a hat-trick, this time against Shakhtar Donetsk, before ending the group stage with another superb performance, scoring four goals in the rout of Malmö FF. The Portuguese didn’t score in the final against Atlético Madrid despite attempting six shots, but he did go on to score the winning penalty in the shootout, as Real Madrid picked up the trophy in Milan. Cristiano Ronaldo’s third-highest scoring UCL season came in 2017-18 at Real Madrid. The Portuguese netted 15 times as Real Madrid went on to win the competition in the final against Liverpool, thanks to a 3-1 victory. Ronaldo didn’t score in the final but did score in 10 other games that season to equal his own record tally of 10 UCL games scored in within a single season alongside 2013-14. Robert Lewandowski came into the 2019-20 Champions League final knowing that a goal would see him replicate Ronaldo’s feat of scoring in 10 different UCL games in a season. It wasn’t to be for the Pole, but his Bayern side still picked up the trophy with a 1-0 win over PSG in the final. Lewandowski had scored in all nine of his games prior to the final (15 goals). 10 of Karim Benzema’s 15 goals in 2021-22 came in the knockout stages of the competition – a joint competition record alongside Ronaldo in 2016-17. A hat-trick in the second leg of the last 16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain was followed by a hat-trick in the first leg against Chelsea and a further goal in the quarter-final second leg, before three goals in the two semi-final games against Manchester City. He didn’t score in the final versus Liverpool, but still saw his Real Madrid side win the title once again. Lionel Messi’s best goalscoring season in the Champions League game back in 2011-12. This was a season where Messi broke all sorts of records, with a phenomenal 73 goals in 60 games. He scored 14 of those goals in the UCL, including five in a single match against Bayer 04 Leverkusen in March 2012. This remains one of only three occasions that a player has scored five times in a Champions League match. Messi’s Barcelona side were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals against eventual 2011-12 winners Chelsea, where the Argentine failed to score in both legs despite attempting 12 shots overall. In what was to be Robert Lewandowski’s final season as a Bayern Munich player, the Polish striker scored 13 goals in 10 games to take his total UCL goal tally to 69 for the Bundesliga champions – only Lionel Messi (120 for Barcelona), Cristiano Ronaldo (105 for Real Madrid) and Karim Benzema (74 for Real Madrid) have scored more for a single club in the competition. Lewandowski looked on to possibly break the UCL season record when he scored nine goals in Bayern’s first five matches of the 2021-22 season, but their eventual defeat in the quarter-finals against Villarreal hindered his chances of plundering more. As well as the seven listed above, there are nine further instances of players scoring more than 10 goals in a single UEFA Champions League season.

We look back at the most lethal teams in the competition’s history. Barcelona hold the record for the most goals scored in a single UCL season, with 45 in the 1999-00 campaign. Helped by the fact that the format that season saw more games played (they played in 16 of a possible 17 matches), their tally has not been replicated before or since. Barca were knocked out in the semi-finals by Valencia, and they saw 13 different players score for them in 1999-00 (excluding own goals) – only Real Madrid in 2001-02 (14) and Borussia Dortmund in 2016-17 (15) have seen their UCL goals come via a wider spread of players across a single season. Rivaldo was their top scorer this season with 10 goals – finishing joint-top of the goal rankings in 1999-00 alongside Real Madrid legend Raúl and Mário Jardel of FC Porto. Unsurprising maybe, given the number of games they played, but Barcelona’s games this season witnessed 68 goals overall – the most of any club in a Champions League season. They conceded 23 goals themselves, which is the seventh highest tally of any team in a single UCL season. Bayern Munich scored 41 goals on the way to lifting their first UEFA Champions League trophy in seven years, back in 2019-20. In a Covid-disrupted season, their 1-0 final win over PSG was both the first to be played behind closed doors and the latest to be played in any season (23 August). Twenty-four of their goals (56%) came in the group stage – only Paris Saint-Germain (25 in 2017-18) have scored more goals in a single group stage campaign. Robert Lewandowski scored 15 of their goals in this season, netting 35% of their total in his 10 appearances. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the competition this season was restructured to have single-leg quarter and semi-finals, meaning that Bayern only played 11 games. Their average goals per game of 3.91 is the most seen by a side in any complete UCL season – had they played the now-standard 13 games that season on the way to their title, they’d have undoubtedly broken the outright goal record in the UCL. Real Madrid sealed their 10th UEFA Champions League crown in 2013-14, achieving ‘La Décima’ by beating Atlético Madrid 4-1 in the final after extra-time. Not only were they the first team to score four times in a UCL final since Milan in 1993-94, but they also ended the season with 41 goals – only two teams have netted more in a single Champions League campaign. Over half (21) of their goals this season came in the knockout stages – more than they scored in the group stage (20). 17 of their goals (41%) were scored by Cristiano Ronaldo, who broke the single-season UCL scoring record – their next best scorer (Gareth Bale) only posted six goals, which was 11 fewer than the Portuguese. Liverpool scored 41 goals on the way to reaching the Champions League final in 2017-18. Fourteen of their goals came in just two of their group stage matches, as they beat Maribor 7-0 away from home before replicating the scoreline at Anfield less than two months later in the rout of Spartak Moscow. Both feature in the biggest wins in UCL history. Overall, only two teams have scored more goals in a single group stage – PSG in 2017-18 (25) and Bayern Munich in 2019-20 (24). Liverpool have only seen three players reach double figures for goals in a single UCL season and all three came in this campaign. The lethal front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané all grabbed 10 goals, but it wouldn’t help Liverpool to the title – they eventually lost 3-1 in the final to Real Madrid in Kyiv. Real Madrid won the 2016-17 Champions League with a 4-1 victory in the final over Juventus. It was Cristiano Ronaldo who was the hero, both in the final (with two goals) and overall that season, with a competition-high 12 goals for the Spanish club. The La Liga side saw 54 goals scored in their 13 matches in 2016-17 overall (36 scored, 18 conceded) – the seventh highest tally by a club in a single UCL season. Real Madrid (1999-00)Real Madrid (2000-01)Real Madrid (2001-02)Real Madrid (2011-12)Barcelona (2011-12) Paris Saint-Germain scored 25 group stage goals in the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League, which remains a record tally in a UCL group stage. Nearly half (12) of these goals came against Celtic, who they beat 5-0 away and 7-1 at home. Neymar scored in all but one of their six group stage games, scoring six times and assisting three more, with five of these goal involvements coming against Celtic. Their prolific goalscoring record didn’t help them in the knockout stages, however – they were sent out of the competition in the round of 16 by eventual winners Real Madrid after a 5-2 aggregate defeat. PSG’s tally was only two more than Liverpool that season, who scored 23 in the group stage – the third highest tally behind Bayern Munich’s 24 in 2019-20. Bayern nearly matched their tally in 2021-22, but fell just short (22 goals), while fellow German club Borussia Dortmund’s 21 group stage goals in 2016-17 is the fifth-highest. Enjoy this?

Ahead of those games, we identified four storylines to watch out for throughout the knockouts. Love is in the air. That’s right, it’s almost 14 February, and you know what that means… the UEFA Champions League is nearly back! Thirty-two teams have already been whittled down to 16 – and before we know it, those 16 will become eight. Holders Manchester City ominously appear to be hitting form at just the right time (if you’re them, anyway); 14-time European champions Real Madrid have made it through to the knockout stage for the 28th straight season; Arsenal are back in the last 16 after seven years away; and perennial continental big-hitters such as Bayern Munich, PSG and Inter are all still standing. The likes of PSV and Real Sociedad might fancy their chances of upsetting the apple cart, while rank outsiders Copenhagen will be determined not to merely make up the numbers. It’s tantalisingly poised, and here at Opta Analyst, we’ve picked out four intriguing storylines to keep an eye on throughout the last 16 and deeper into the tournament. The Champions League is meant to be a competition for the best of the best. We know that’s not necessarily the case: Chelsea won it in 2011-12 while finishing sixth in the Premier League; and, going back to the European Cup days, Aston Villa placed 11th in the old First Division as they were crowned continental champions in 1981-82. In 2014-15, Borussia Dortmund topped their Champions League group while propping up the Bundesliga table (they went out in the last 16 and ultimately recovered to finish seventh domestically, but, for a while, something very strange was happening). Anyway, fast-forward to 2023-24 and the last-16 lineup is far from a straightforward exhibition of Europe’s crème de la crème. Only four of the teams lead their respective domestic leagues at the time of writing: Real Madrid (by five points from surprise package Girona, whom they beat on Saturday), PSG (by 11 points), PSV (by 10 points) and Inter (by seven points). Another six sides – RB Leipzig, Real Sociedad, Lazio, Borussia Dortmund, Atlético Madrid and Napoli – are at least 10 points off the pace domestically. Of those six, only Dortmund and Atlético currently occupy a spot that would clinch Champions League qualification for next season; Lazio and Napoli are placed eighth and ninth in Serie A respectively. All 16 of these clubs were in Europe last season – and with the exception of Arsenal, Lazio and Real Sociedad, they were all in the Champions League – so it’s not as though the added rigours of a continental campaign will have come as a shock to any of them. Perhaps, rather, we need to recalibrate how we perceive the competition: it is an exclusive gathering of the continent’s finest – but, to a large degree, the continent’s finest from last season. To that end, the Champions League will always be running on a delay, so to speak – an awful lot can change over the summer – but that just feeds into the enduring captivation of the game’s ultimate knockout tournament. Put this one to your mates in the group chat: name the three English players to finish as top scorer (outright or joint) in a Champions League/European Cup campaign. They are: Dennis Viollet (nine goals for Manchester United in 1956-57), Mick Jones (eight goals for Leeds United in 1969-70) and Terry McDermott (six goals for Liverpool in 1980-81 – joint with teammate Graeme Souness and Bayern Munich’s Karl-Heinz Rummenigge). Ok, a player born in England has finished as top scorer since then – Erling Haaland, whose 12 goals helped fire Manchester City to Champions League glory as part of the treble last term – but that wouldn’t be an acceptable answer in our mini quiz, sorry. It’s been 43 years – perhaps surprisingly for a country whose clubs have won the tournament nine times during that period – since an Englishman out-scored the rest. There’s a reasonable chance that long wait comes to an end this season, though. Four players are currently tied for the honour of leading marksman in the 2023-24 Champions League with five goals: Haaland, Atlético Madrid pair Álvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann, and Rasmus Højlund of Manchester United, who’s out of the competition so won’t be adding to his total. But among the eight level in second with four goals are England’s two standout players at present: Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane.  Key men for Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively, both will fancy their chances of winning the competition and, by extension, potentially scooping the ‘golden boot’ (ludicrously, UEFA don’t actually hand out a literal award). With Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema out of the picture, Robert Lewandowski not his prolific old self and Haaland enduring an injury-disrupted campaign, the race to finish as Champions League top scorer looks quite open – although it would take something extraordinary for us to see the first non-European or South American winner since 1998-99, when Dwight Yorke finished as joint-leading scorer. Porto’s Iranian number nine Mehdi Taremi (two goals) is the strongest candidate, but he’d probably have to become supernatural ahead of facing Arsenal in the last 16 to achieve that feat. In its 31-year existence, the Champions League has arguably only produced what could reasonably be called a surprise winner on one occasion: José Mourinho’s Porto in 2003-04. That’s the exception that proves the rule: the Champions League does belong to Europe’s elite. It’s a season-long competition, though, and, even if the winners invariably ultimately come from the continent’s top crop, there’s plenty of opportunity for surprises to be sprung on the long and winding road to the final (which in 2024, for the third time in 14 years, will take place at Wembley). In 2021-22, Villarreal under European master Unai Emery stunned Juventus and Bayern Munich to set up a semi-final showdown with Liverpool, giving the Reds a bit of a scare before bowing out 5-2 on aggregate. Three years before that, Ajax evoked memories of their heyday as a youthful side – managed by Erik ten Hag – came within touching distance of the final, only to fall victim to Lucas Moura-inspired Tottenham in the semis. Whether any team can emulate such underdog stories to the same extent this time around remains to be seen, but a couple of the last-16 participants do stand out as having particular surprise potential. PSV are gearing up to take on Borussia Dortmund, and the runaway Eredivisie leaders arguably go into the tie as favourites, despite Dortmund beating PSG to top spot in their group. Peter Bosz’s talent-packed side came second behind Arsenal in a competitive Group B, coming from 2-0 down to win 3-2 away to Sevilla (who, admittedly, had a player sent off while 2-0 up) en route. They’ve lost just twice all season in all competitions and, incredibly, only dropped their first league points of 2023-24 last month. PSV don’t score bags of goals – Dortmund (7) are one of only three last-16 qualifiers to manage fewer than their eight during the group stage – but in attacking focal point Luuk de Jong, they have one of Europe’s most in-form strikers right now. De Jong has found the net nine times in his last eight outings in all competitions; the aerial powerhouse has also scored just under half of his goals (12/26) this season with his head – potentially bad news for a Dortmund side who have conceded 19% of their goals in the Champions League and Bundesliga this term from set-pieces (excluding penalties). Meanwhile, down in the Basque Country, Real Sociedad are preparing to take on PSG in just their second Champions League knockout stage appearance – and their first for 20 years. Imanol Alguacil’s men are seventh in La Liga, 11 points off Champions League qualification, but they have lost only five games in all competitions this term. Draws (10 of them, to be precise) have been their downfall domestically; they could work to their advantage in Europe, however. Indeed, they already have: they held Inter twice during an unbeaten group campaign, pipping the Serie A leaders to top spot on goal difference. La Real are not prolific scorers: they registered just seven goals in their six group matches, drawing a blank in the final two. But they also boast a miserly defensive record: they let in just two group-stage goals, at least two fewer than any other Champions League team. And they didn’t ride their luck, either: they gave up a veritably stingy 3.81 expected goals (xG) at an average of 0.63 per game (only Manchester City conceded less). PSG scored a relatively low nine goals during the group stage; Kylian Mbappé and co. might have to be patient for a breakthrough against Alguacil’s supremely well-drilled side. Haaland has made 35 Champions League appearances; he’ll have made a maximum of 42 Champions League appearances by the end of this season. He’s 10 goals away from 50 in the competition, a milestone reached by only eight players in its entire history. At the age of 23, Manchester City’s merciless goal-bot has found the net more times in Europe’s premier club competition than Ferenc Puskás, Gerd Müller, Wayne Rooney or Samuel Eto’o did throughout their entire careers in the UCL or European Cup. You’d expect Haaland to overtake Sergio Agüero (41 Champions League goals, excluding qualifiers), Alessandro Del Piero (42) and Neymar (43) this season, and it would come as no great surprise to see him also surpass Kylian Mbappé (also 43). You don’t need us to remind you that the record-breaking 2022-23 Premier League Golden Boot winner bangs in the goals at a borderline unnecessary rate, but these numbers really put into perspective what an absolutely ridiculous trajectory he’s on. Haaland notched 12 goals in last season’s Champions League, finishing as top scorer. Five of those came in one game, City’s 7-0 last-16 second-leg evisceration of RB Leipzig, a reminder of how, seemingly at the flick of a switch, the former Borussia Dortmund and Red Bull Salzburg man can go into goalscoring overdrive. He’s not been at his supra-earthly best in 2023-24 – injuries have disrupted his rhythm – but even at mortal levels, Haaland is amply capable of racking up the goals, and it ought to be to his advantage that City face Copenhagen in the last 16. In any case, if Haaland keeps up his average of scoring every 84 minutes in the Champions League this term and his average playing time of… 84 minutes per Champions League game, and Pep Guardiola’s 2022-23 treble winners reach the final once more, Haaland will end the campaign with 12 goals to his name again. That in itself would take him up to 47 overall – above Del Piero, Neymar, Mohamed Salah (44), Didier Drogba (44) and Filippo Inzaghi (46) on the competition’s all-time list – but it might only require one freakishly clinical completely normal by his standards performance to hit the 50-goal mark, passing Zlatan Ibrahimović and Andriy Shevchenko (both 48) in the process. We must mention Monsieur Mbappé, too. PSG’s main man is seven away from joining Thierry Henry as the second Frenchman to reach a half-century of Champions League goals. Were he to hit the magic 50-mark, the 25-year-old would also become the first to do so having only played for French clubs. Enjoy this?

Early in the season, the Opta supercomputer ran 10,000 simulations of the 2023-24 Champions League season and found that holders Manchester City won the competition 38.9% of the time. They were, back when the draw had just been made, huge favourites to retain their title. Now, with the competition returning on Tuesday with City travelling to Denmark to face FC Copenhagen and European heavyweights Real Madrid facing RB Leipzig, we decided it was as good a time as any to see how the supercomputer rates each team’s chances. So, in the latest batch of 10,000 simulations of the rest of the season, this is how often each team progressed to each stage of the competition, as well as how often they won it. Of the 16 teams remaining, only four were victorious in more than one-tenth of those simulations. City remain favourites to win the Champions League again after winning the treble last season, doing so 32.1% of the time. At the time of writing, they even have a greater-than-50% chance of reaching the final. Having broken the psychological barrier by winning Europe’s biggest competition for the first time in their history last season, Pep Guardiola’s side are the team to beat in 2023-24.  Real Madrid are second-favourites to win the Champions League, with the 14-time winners tipped to make it 15 in 15.4% of the supercomputer’s simulations. Madrid make the final in 28.1% of simulations, while they are huge favourites to make it past Leipzig and they have just shy of a 50% chance of making it as far as the last four. Last season’s beaten finalists, Inter Milan, are deemed the third-most likely side to win the Champions League (11.6%), while they reach the final in just under a quarter of the supercomputer’s simulations. The Serie A leaders are hitting their stride in the second half of the season, unbeaten inside 90 minutes in their last 25 competitive matches. Ahead of what could be a tricky round-of-16 tie with Atlético Madrid, they are on a run of seven straight victories and are big favourites to make it past Diego Simeone’s side. History tells us Atlético should never be fully written off, but with just a 6.1% chance of reaching the final and a 2.4% likelihood of winning the whole thing, it would be a bigger surprise than ever before if Atlético go deep in the competition. Harry Kane’s chances of ending his wait for silverware took a huge hit on Saturday when Bayern Munich were brushed aside by Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen. Although he won’t have given up on winning a domestic trophy this season, the Champions League will have taken on added importance now. They are the fourth favourites to win the trophy according to the Opta supercomputer (10.1%), while they are the second-most likely team to make it through their last-16 tie, seeing off Lazio – a tournament outsider according to our simulations – 79.3% of the time. At 8.4%, Arsenal still have a noteworthy chance of winning the Champions League for the first time, while they make the final in nearly a fifth of simulations. Having come through a tough time around Christmas when their form took a bit of a hit, Mikel Arteta’s side have recovered in time for the Champions League knockout stages. They battered West Ham on Sunday, and are now on a run of four straight wins as their round-of-16 tie with Porto comes into sight. Paris Saint-Germain are the sixth-most likely team to win the Champions League, doing so in 6.4% of simulations. The runaway Ligue 1 leaders are surely a certainty to win their domestic league once again and appear to have become a better collective unit since losing star players Neymar and Lionel Messi. The Champions League is the one trophy they want more than any other, and it has always remained beyond them in years gone by, but with Kylian Mbappé in tow, anything can happen. They face Real Sociedad this week, and have a 64.5% chance of seeing them off. Barcelona (3.4%) and Borussia Dortmund (3.0%) are next in our predictions list, but neither team is having a great season domestically and will have to improve dramatically if they are to beat the best of the best and win Europe’s elite competition.  Seven teams are deemed to have a chance of 1.5% or lower of winning the competition. In Porto (two titles) and PSV Eindhoven (one title), those seven teams have some European pedigree among them, but RB Leipzig, Real Sociedad, Napoli, Lazio and Copenhagen would all be maiden winners. Copenhagen’s chances of making it past City are pretty slim, and their chances of winning the whole thing are so low that to one decimal place they round down to 0%.

But they did just that, against the odds. After a sensational 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast were finally crowned as winners after coming from behind to beat Nigeria 2-1 in Sunday’s final. It was just their third AFCON success after previous titles in 1992 and 2015, but neither of those had nearly as much drama as this one. They certainly did it the hard way, but in lifting the Africa Cup of Nations trophy, Ivory Coast became the first host nation to win the tournament since Egypt in 2006 – that ended a run of eight AFCON tournaments and nine host nations without success. It was a tournament of two halves for the hosts. Despite winning the opening game 2-0 against Guinea-Bissau, the group stage was largely a disaster for Ivory Coast. That opening victory turned out to be more down to the opposition’s weakness – Guinea-Bissau were one of only two teams at AFCON 2023 to lose every single match – than Ivorian strength. A 1-0 defeat to Nigeria followed on Matchday 2 before the nadir of Ivory Coast’s international football history looked set to send them out of the group stage in their own tournament. The 4-0 loss to Equatorial Guinea in the final group game was their record defeat on home soil and was arguably one of the biggest shocks in AFCON history. The underdogs were ruthless in Abidjan, constantly catching Ivory Coast on the counter and scoring four times from 10 shots. Two of Equatorial Guinea’s goals came via eventual top scorer Emilio Nsue, who ended up as the oldest Golden Boot winner at an AFCON (34 years old) since Roger Milla in 1988 (35). Jean-Louis Gasset was sensationally sacked the following morning, despite Ivory Coast having the lifeline of a third-place finish potentially sneaking them into the knockout stages. That lifeline eventually arrived, as disastrous final group games sent Ghana and Algeria home and meant Ivory Coast went through as one of the best third-placed teams, even though they had just three points. Emerse Faé – one of Gasset’s assistants – was promoted to interim manager and it felt like the Ivorians had nothing to lose. The Opta supercomputer predictions mirrored that feeling at the time of the change. After kicking off the tournament as second favourites by the supercomputer at 12.1% behind only reigning champions Senegal (12.8%), those chances had dropped to 3.9% when they discovered they would face defending champions Senegal in the last 16. But they saw them off and then, amazingly, at 1-0 down to Mali in the 90th minute of their quarter-final tie, their chances had fallen below 1%. But until that’s zero and a team is knocked out of the tournament, the seemingly impossible can’t be written off. Faé went on to achieve what few thought was possible and led his nation to their first AFCON title since 2015. In doing so, he became the first person to become a team’s coach after the start of the tournament and win that same tournament in Africa Cup of Nations history. They weren’t far off Egypt’s AFCON record from the 2021 tournament, when they finished as runners-up to Senegal having played 801 minutes and 49 seconds of match time (including all added time and extra time). This Ivory Coast side topped the minutes played ranking for the 2023 edition with 776 minutes and 48 seconds – 13 minutes, 23 seconds longer than South Africa in this edition and over an hour more than Senegal had to play on the way to winning the previous edition (704:39). But it was Ivory Coast’s ability to time their goals to perfection that helped them seal the title. In the last-16 tie against Senegal they equalised in the 86th minute before going on to win a penalty shootout. In the quarter-final against Mali, Simon Adingra scored their equaliser in second-half added time before scoring the winner via Oumar Diakité with almost the final kick of extra-time. Sebastian Haller was the hero in the semi-final and final, as the Borussia Dortmund striker put them into the lead in the 65th and 81st minutes, respectively. The final saw them in a losing position for nearly twice as long as they led (29:18 vs 16:55). Overall, at AFCON 2023, Ivory Coast spent only 18.8% of match time in a winning position – 145 minutes, 39 seconds in total. That was exactly half the proportion of time spent winning as Angola (37.6%) and less than half that of Nigeria (39.4%), Morocco (51.5%) and Senegal (70.0%). Incredibly, the hosts spent 95 minutes and 50 seconds longer in a losing position than they did a winning position at the tournament. To put that into a little more context, Senegal – who Ivory Coast knocked out in the last 16 on penalties – only played four matches at the tournament but led their opponents for 310 minutes and 10 seconds in total. That was 164 minutes and 31 seconds longer in a leading position than Ivory Coast at AFCON 2023. Overall, in the knockout stages, Ivory Coast led their opponents for just 51 minutes and six seconds across 470 minutes and 56 seconds of action – that’s 10.8% of match time in the lead over four knockout games on the way to winning the title. Peak tournament football. Overall, including all added time and extra time at the tournament, the Ivory Coast attack was hardly threatening. They averaged 0.96 expected goals (xG) per 90 – the 13th best at the finals. They were slightly more impressive in defence, giving up just 0.80 xG per 90 to opponents to give them the seventh-best average at the tournament. So, did Ivory Coast’s success at AFCON 2023 come down to a lot of luck? It’s sometimes said that luck is when preparation meets opportunity, and there’s definitely a sense of that when analysing their success. No, they didn’t impress that much at the tournament, but when opportunities came their way in front of goal, they took them… and with impeccable timing. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to their tie with our RB Leipzig vs Real Madrid prediction and preview. Real Madrid will be looking to seize an early initiative at the first hurdle of the UEFA Champions League knockout stages when they visit RB Leipzig on Tuesday at Red Bull Arena for the opening leg of their round-of-16 clash. Carlo Ancelotti’s side breezed through Group C, recording a perfect six victories from as many games after beating Napoli, Braga and Union Berlin both home and away. Madrid averaged over two goals per game in their routine progression to the last 16, aided by convincing home victories over Braga and Napoli. That six-game winning run is their longest in the competition since their 10-match streak of victories between April 2014 and February 2015, although that will matter little to Ancelotti and the Madrid supporters if they do not go deep in the Champions League once again, having been knocked out in the semi-finals to eventual winners Manchester City last season. Madrid’s dominance in Europe this term can largely be credited to Jude Bellingham, who has either scored or assisted in all five of his Champions League appearances for Los Blancos so far following his move from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. The England midfielder also leads the way for chances created following a carry (nine) and via a line-breaking pass (six), while no player has created more chances from open play in the competition overall this term than Bellingham (15). Aided by their superstar Bellingham, alongside the likes of Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo in attack, Madrid will fancy their chances of extending an impressive knockout-stage record. They have progressed from 11 of their last 13 round of 16 ties in the Champions League, reaching at least the semi-final in each of the last three campaigns since elimination at this stage to Man City in 2019-20. However, the draw for this round of UEFA’s top club competition was not seen as favourable for the La Liga leaders in Opta’s data simulations. Madrid saw their chances of lifting the trophy for a 15th time fall by 2.37% – the biggest drop of any remaining side – leaving them with a 12.9% of winning this coveted tournament when the draw was made. That has risen slightly to 14.8% at the time of writing. As for Ancelotti’s lineup on Tuesday, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, David Alaba, Antonio Rüdiger, and Éder Militão all remain as longer-term absentees. Vinícius\\xa0and Eduardo Camavinga were both fit enough for Saturday’s resounding 4-0 victory over Girona in La Liga, though Bellingham limped off and Ancelotti will be without his star man due to an ankle injury. In stark contrast to their visitors, this will only be RB Leipzig’s fourth appearance in the Champions League knockout stages and the first time they’ve not faced an English opponent in the round of 16. The Bundesliga club eliminated Tottenham on their way to reaching the semi-final in 2019-20, before being knocked by Liverpool in 2020-21 and eventual winners Manchester City last season. Marco Rose’s side finished second behind Pep Guardiola’s defending European champions in Group G, losing twice to the Premier League side but defeating Young Boys and Crvena Zvezda both home and away to qualify for the last-16 draw. Loïs Openda was the leading attacking figure for Leipzig in their group-stage run, scoring four Champions League goals. Only Christopher Nkunku, whose impressive returns in Europe secured his move to Chelsea, has ever netting more in a single campaign for the German side (seven in 2021-22). As for the rest of Rose’s squad, experienced goalkeeper Péter Gulácsi recently made his Bundesliga return from injury, as did captain Willi Orbán, while Amadou Haidara is back from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Mali and Mohamed Simakan returned from domestic suspension in Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Augsburg in the Bundesliga. Madrid have made light work of German sides in this competition in recent years, losing just one of their last 15 such Champions League matches, though that was a 3-2 group-stage loss to Leipzig last season. Josko Gvardiol, Nkunku and Timo Werner were all on target for the Bundesliga side in that victory, in which Rodrygo and Vinícius Júnior also scored, though the Leipzig trio have since made Premier League moves to Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham respectively. Madrid were 2-0 winners in the opening group-stage meeting between the two sides in September 2022 – the first time the pair met in the Champions League – as Federico Valverde and now-departed Marco Asensio scored. The omens are positive for Ancelotti’s side as well, with Madrid’s strong record against German sides meaning the last such opponent to eliminate them in the knockout stages was Borussia Dortmund in the 2012-13 semi-final. Real Madrid’s perfect six-game European winning run may have Leipzig fearful for the last-16 encounter, while the La Liga leaders are also unbeaten in 27 straight matches across all competitions since their 3-1 reverse against fierce rivals Atlético\\xa0Madrid back in September. The defensive solidity of Rose’s side remains in question, too, with Leipzig failing to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 13 Champions League home games, since beating Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0 in October 2020. However, Leipzig have only failed to score in one of their 20 games in UEFA’s premier club competition at the Red Bull Arena, finding the net in each of their last 16. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Tuesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite an encouraging showing to reach this round, RB Leipzig are seen as one of the biggest underdogs in the last-16 stage, with just a 28.5% chance of making it to the quarter-finals in the data-led predictions by Opta’s supercomputer. Only Lazio (21.7%) against Bayern Munich and FC København (6.4%) versus Manchester City have smaller likelihoods of progressing, with Los Blancos going through to the next stage in 71.6% of 10,000 data-led simulations. Ancelotti’s side win the first leg of this last-16 clash in 43.5% of the data-led predictions, while Leipzig triumph in just 31.9% and the draw occurred in 24.6%.

We look ahead to Tuesday’s game at Parken Stadium with our FC Copenhagen vs Manchester City prediction and preview. The UEFA Champions League is back, and on Tuesday, all eyes will be on the defending champions. Real Madrid – who won three successive titles between 2015-16 and 2017-18 – are the only team to retain European football’s top prize since the competition’s 1992 rebrand, but Manchester City approach the knockout rounds as the team to beat once more. Will they make light work of underdogs Copenhagen? In the latest edition of the Opta supercomputer’s tournament predictions, City are assigned a 32.1% chance of going all the way and winning their second European crown, making them clear favourites ahead of Madrid (15.4%), Inter (11.6%) and Bayern Munich (10.1%). Pep Guardiola’s side are given a huge 93.9% chance of advancing past Copenhagen, and given their recent form, it’s easy to see why. Saturday’s 2-0 Premier League win over Everton made it 10 straight victories for City across all competitions, and they remain on course for a repeat of last season’s treble. Worryingly for Copenhagen, goal machine Erling Haaland looked back to his best against the Toffees, netting twice to halt a run of 17 shots and 418 minutes without a Premier League goal. Haaland has scored 40 goals in just 35 appearances in the Champions League, and the Norwegian led all players in the competition for non-penalty shots (27), shots on target (16) and expected goals (3.83 xG) throughout the group stage, while joining Antoine Griezmann, Álvaro Morata and Rasmus Højlund at the top of the scoring charts with five goals in as many games. Guardiola is spoilt for choice behind Haaland, with Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva all hoping to return to the lineup after being rested on Saturday. Julián Álvarez could keep his place, having recorded six goal involvements in his last five Champions League games (five goals, one assist), despite only starting one of those matches. He is averaging a goal or an assist every 31 minutes in the competition this season. At the base of midfield, Guardiola will again rely on Rodri, the hero of last year’s final victory over Inter in Istanbul. The Spaniard has made more line-breaking passes than any other player in the Champions League this term (100), while his 306 successful passes in the opposition half are at least 48 more than any other player (former teammate Ilkay Gündoğan has 258). With City injury-free and in ominous form, Copenhagen will have to stay resolute and wait for their opportunity to break, with the holders averaging 70.4% possession in their Champions League games this season. There are only five instances on record (since 2003-04) of a team averaging more than that in a single campaign, with four of those being posted by Guardiola teams (Barcelona in 2009-10, 2010-11, and 2011-12, Bayern in 2015-16). Copenhagen aren’t just here to make up the numbers though, as they proved by finishing above Galatasaray and Manchester United to qualify from Group A. Jacob Neestrup’s men even earned a goalless draw against Bayern in November, so City would be wise not to take them lightly. The Danish Superliga champions are appearing in the Champions League knockout stages for just the second time, having suffered a 2-0 aggregate defeat to Chelsea in the last 16 back in 2010-11. Copenhagen were last in league action in early December, with a long winter break giving them time to stew on back-to-back defeats to Viborg and AGF, which left them third in the table. However, they might just relish their underdog role and are well-versed in playing on the break. Across the Champions League’s group stage, only three teams allowed their opponents more passes per defensive action than Copenhagen (16.8 PPDA), and only four began their sequences closer to their own goal than the Danes’ average of 39.2 metres. In 18-year-old forward Roony Bardghji, meanwhile, Copenhagen can call upon one of Europe’s most in-demand wonderkids, and he is eyeing a piece of history on Tuesday. Bardghji scored the winner as Copenhagen recorded a stunning 4-3 victory over Manchester United in November, and he could now become just the second teenager to net against two different English clubs in the Champions League after Kylian Mbappé (Man City and Liverpool). No teenager has ever achieved that feat in a single season. This will be the fifth meeting between the teams, with Copenhagen yet to record a single victory against City (two draws, two defeats). However, they have drawn both of their previous home matches against the Citizens, 2-2 in the 2008-09 UEFA Cup and 0-0 in last season’s Champions League group stage. Indeed, City have never won an away game against Danish opponents in major European competition, also losing at Aalborg BK in the UEFA Cup in 2009. They did, however, win 1-0 at FC Midtjylland in 2008-09 UEFA Cup qualifying. Danish sides have lost all three of their previous European Cup/Champions League home games against reigning European champions by an aggregate score of 12-0. Køge BK lost 5-0 to Bayern in 1976, Aalborg were beaten 3-0 by Man Utd in 2008 and FC Nordsjælland were thrashed 4-0 by Chelsea in 2012. City have won their last eight Champions League games, the longest winning run recorded by an English club in European Cup/Champions League history. The last team to enjoy a longer winning streak in the competition was Bayern, who won 15 straight between 2019 and 2020. However, City haven’t always impressed on their travels in Europe. Indeed, despite winning the competition last season, City have not won any of their last five away games in the Champions League’s knockout stages, drawing four and losing one since beating Sporting CP 5-0 in the last 16 in 2021-22. Copenhagen ended the group stage with back-to-back home wins over United and Galatasaray, but across all competitions, they have lost three of their last five at Parken Stadium (two wins). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Tuesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Across 10,000 match simulations conducted by the Opta supercomputer ahead of kick-off, City beat Copenhagen in 71.0% of scenarios. That is easily the highest win probability given to any team for this week’s first set of knockout fixtures, ahead of Bayern, who have a 56.7% chance of winning their first leg at Lazio. Copenhagen are given just an 11.3% chance of a surprise win, while the likelihood of a draw is rated at 17.7%. The hosts would surely be content to simply remain in the tie ahead of the return fixture at the Etihad Stadium. FC Copenhagen: Kamil Grabara, Theo Sander, Rúnar Rúnarsson, Kevin Diks, Denis Vavro, David Khocholava, Christian Sørensen, Nicolai Boilesen, Peter Ankersen, Birger Meling, Scott McKenna, Viktor Claesson, Magnus Mattsson, Mohamed Elyounoussi, Lukas Lerager, Diogo Gonçalves, Jordan Larsson, Andreas Cornelius, Khouma Babacar, Elias Achouri, Rasmus Falk. Head Coach: Jacob Neestrup. Manchester City: Stefan Ortega, Ederson, Scott Carson, Kyle Walker, Rúben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Aké, Sergio Gómez, Joško Gvardiol, Manuel Akanji, Mateo Kovačić, Jack Grealish, Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Matheus Nunes, Phil Foden, Erling Haaland, Jérémy Doku, Julián Álvarez. Head Coach: Pep Guardiola. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

As the campaign goes on, we’ll track the chance of each of the frontrunners in the title race. Suffice to say, it was a bad weekend for Aston Villa. It doesn’t bode well that they followed up their first home defeat in the Premier League in over 11 months against Newcastle with another, having also been beaten on home turf by Chelsea in the FA Cup in midweek. Their title chances – according to the Opta supercomputer – only stood at 0.2% heading into Matchday 24, but Villa’s 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United on Sunday coupled with wins for all their rivals has seen their chances drop to just 0.01%. Enter your favourite Dumb & Dumber meme here. Manchester City maintained their ominous form as they beat Everton 2-0 thanks to a second-half brace from Erling Haaland. That makes it six league wins in a row for the defending champions since their brief hiatus to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December. Pep Guardiola’s side increased their favourites tag to retain the title with their latest victory at the Etihad Stadium, moving up from 66.2% to 67.7%. Their likeliest competition still comes from familiar foes Liverpool, who bounced back from their loss at Arsenal last week to beat Burnley 3-1 on Saturday. It wasn’t a straightforward win for Jürgen Klopp’s men and wasn’t the first time Vincent Kompany has looked to give them problems in a title race, but headers from Diogo Jota, Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez gave them the win at Anfield. Due primarily to City’s victory, though, Liverpool’s chances of sending Klopp off into the sunset with a second Premier League title still dropped according to the supercomputer, going from 26.1% to 24%. It was another big win for Arsenal, though, not just in terms of importance but in the sheer number of goals scored. They wiped the floor with West Ham in a tremendously one-sided London derby. Declan Rice was predictably among the scorers in a 6-0 trouncing at London Stadium on Sunday. The supercomputer still doesn’t view the Gunners as particularly strong challengers to City, but we did at least see a rise in their percentage from 7.4% to 8.2%. Keep up the form that has seen them win their first four league games of 2024 and that number will continue to go up. Tottenham just about kept their name in the reckoning with a 96th-minute winner against Brighton. Ange Postecoglou’s side have conceded more 90+ minute goals than any other team in the Premier League this season but have now scored the joint-most 90+ minute winners (three – level with Man Utd) thanks to Brennan Johnson’s late strike at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They remain on just a 0.1% likelihood of winning the league, but luckily for Spurs their manager won’t be concerned. Postecoglou said of our supercomputer just last week: “A supercomputer? Does it go to a phone booth and change into something else from just a normal computer?  “What did it say, 0.1%? So, we got a chance then. Let’s go for it. No problems, no issues with that. We’ve got a chance.” Arsenal may have defeated league leaders Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon, but it was Manchester City who were the overall winners from Matchday 23 of the Premier League season. At kick-off in north London on Sunday, Man City’s chances of a record fourth Premier League title in a row stood at 54.5%, with Liverpool on 41.4% and Arsenal at 3.7%. Following the Gunners’ win and City’s victory at Brentford on Monday night, the defending champions have moved up to 66.2% – their highest projected chance since before kick-off in their 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa on 6 December. Of course, with every winner is a loser. The loser after MD 23 is undoubtedly Liverpool, who’s meek performance in the defeat to Arsenal has seen their title chances fall by 15.3% since kick-off on Sunday. Of course, they still currently lead the league table, but for how long? Pep Guardiola’s side have a game in hand at home to Brentford coming up in two weeks’ time, now knowing that a win in that match (depending on results before it) could see them move a point ahead of Jürgen Klopp’s Reds. With Arsenal now only two points off Liverpool, their fans will be surprised to see their current chances of a first Premier League title win since 2004 projected at just 7.4%, even if that has doubled in less than 48 hours. Lack of title success in the last 20 years will be one reason for this, with the Opta supercomputer leaning towards the recent power of Liverpool and Man City in the competition. Arsenal came close to upsetting things last season but ultimately fell short despite leading the table for 248 days overall – an English top-flight record for a side that failed to go on and win the title. The Gunners have spent just 23 days top of the Premier League so far this season, but keeping close and stealing the title at the last would suit them just fine. The midweek Premier League fixtures involving those in the title race didn’t throw up many surprises, apart from arguably at Villa Park on Tuesday. It was a far from ideal Matchday 22 for Aston Villa. Given they were thrashed 5-1 by Newcastle United on MD 1 at St James’ Park, it should perhaps not have been much a surprise that Eddie Howe’s men also won 3-1 in the reverse fixture. However, it was Villa’s first Premier League home defeat since last February and just Newcastle’s second away league win of the season, so it did raise some eyebrows. One thing that certainly wasn’t raised was Villa’s title chance percentage, which has dipped from 1.0% to 0.1% according to the Opta supercomputer. Arsenal took advantage on Tuesday by overcoming Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground. It may not have done much for their chances, with the supercomputer only increasing them from 2.5% to 3.3%, but should they beat Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, that could well be a significant difference maker. Speaking of which, Jürgen Klopp might be off soon but his players seem determined to give him a big finish at Liverpool. The Premier League leaders cemented their place at the top with a convincing 4-1 win over Chelsea at Anfield on Wednesday, and are closing in on Manchester City in terms of title chances. Our predictor has given their likelihood a boost from 36.6% up to 42.1% to hand Klopp a goodbye league title. Man City didn’t let Liverpool increase their lead after they dispatched Burnley 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Because of the Reds’ victory, though, the defending champions have seen their predictor percentage dip. Having had a 59.7% chance after the last matchday, Pep Guardiola’s men now retain their crown in just 54.4% of the supercomputer’s 10,000 simulations. Tottenham leapfrogged Villa in the table up to fourth on goals scored after their 3-2 victory over Brentford on Wednesday. Ange Postecoglou’s side were made to work for it by the Bees, but seal a win they did, even though due to others winning above them, their title chances have gone down from 0.2% to 0.1%. The second half of MD 21 saw title contenders Arsenal and Liverpool in action. Manchester City had to watch on as both enjoyed big victories. With a 5-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace, the Gunners registered their joint-biggest margin of victory in a Premier League London derby, alongside a 5-0 win against Wimbledon back in April 1998. It was a much-needed win for Mikel Arteta’s men who put a four-game winless run to bed. It didn’t increase their chances of winning the title however, and that’s because on Sunday afternoon a second-half salvo from Liverpool saw them score four goals to blow away Bournemouth. It was the first time Liverpool had scored four or more goals in a Premier League away game this season, while it was their largest away league winning margin since April 2023 at Leeds (6-1). Darwin Núñez and Diogo Jota both scored twice, taking each player into double figures for goals in all competitions for the Reds this season as Jürgen Klopp’s men extended their lead at the Premier League summit to five points. That win saw them increase their chances of Premier League glory by 4.7%, and they’re now a 36.6% shot to win the title according to the Opta supercomputer.  Liverpool’s win knocked the chasing pack’s chances down. City’s title odds dropped by 4.0%, while Arsenal (-0.3%), Aston Villa (-0.4%) and Tottenham (-0.1%) all saw their overall chances decrease slightly.  With Matchday 21 spread over two weeks due to the Premier League’s winter break, just 10 teams were in action this past weekend. There was still plenty of intrigue at the top of the table though, with Manchester City, Aston Villa and Tottenham all in action.  It was City, of course, who were the big winners from the first half of MD 21 (what we’ve creatively called MD 21 (A) in the graphic below). Not only did they pick up a huge three points away at Newcastle, but they did so courtesy of Kevin De Bruyne, who made his first appearance in 155 days.  As we mused ahead of the contest, De Bruyne could be the difference in the title race this season, and his stunning 25-minute cameo did little to dissuade us. Trailing 2-1, the Belgian scored the equaliser and then assisted Oscar Bobb’s last-minute winner with an outrageous pass.  According to the Opta supercomputer, that win saw City strengthen their grip on the title by an extra 3.2%.  In fact, Pep Guardiola’s side were the only team to see their title odds increase after MD 21 (A). Aston Villa (-1.5%) and Tottenham (-0.2%) – both outsiders in the race – were held to draws against Everton and Manchester United on Sunday. Liverpool (-0.2%) and Arsenal (-1.2%) didn’t play this weekend, but both saw their title chances take a hit due to Man City’s win.  For the moment, this remains a two-horse race between Man City (63.7%) and Liverpool (31.9%), with old foes Jürgen Klopp and Guardiola set to do battle once more.  In early December when we looked at the fixture difficulty of each side’s next five Premier League matches, we alerted Arsenal fans that it had the potential to be a tough run of games. Only Crystal Palace had a trickier Christmas period than the Gunners, and with just five points collected from those five games, it proved to be the case for Mikel Arteta’s side. December started well for Arsenal, with a home win over Wolves followed up by a dramatic 4-3 comeback victory over Luton at Kenilworth Road on 5 December, but then they began to falter. A harsh 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa, where they should have got something and even had a late goal controversially ruled out, was followed by an impressive 2-0 home win over Brighton and an excellent point away at Liverpool before Christmas. That point ensured that Arsenal would top the Premier League at Christmas for a second successive year. The problem for Arsenal? They have failed to go on and win the league in each of the last five top-flight seasons in which they have held first place on Xmas Day. Results since then have made that curse feel real. After drawing with Liverpool, Arsenal went on to win the Premier League title in 26.8% of the Opta supercomputer’s 10,000 season simulations. Back-to-back defeats versus London rivals West Ham and Fulham over the space of four days have seen Arsenal’s projected title chance fall to just 4.0%, however. With Man City away in Saudi Arabia, winning the FIFA Club World Cup, Pep Guardiola’s men saw their game on 23 December against Brentford postponed, but despite only having two league matches over the festive and new year period, they have been the biggest winners. Their projected title chance has jumped 15.8% from 44.7% on 23 December to 60.5% today following wins over Everton and Sheffield United. Starting the season as overwhelming favourites with the Opta supercomputer, they began to see their chances of a record fourth consecutive top-flight English league title drop after a terrible four-game run without a win (D3 L1) between 12 November and 6 December. That dropped as low as 39.3% following Crystal Palace’s late comeback in the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium on 16 December. Liverpool have taken advantage of Arsenal and Manchester City’s mixed form across the last two months, with their projected chance of a title win now at 32.1% – 10% higher than it was on Christmas Eve. A 2-0 win over Burnley on Boxing Day was followed by their fantastic attacking performance in the 4-2 victory against Newcastle on New Year’s Day. Aston Villa may only be three points off leaders Liverpool but could be overtaken by Manchester City with their game in hand. Their chances currently stand at 2.9%, which is down from 7.9% on the morning of their match against bottom side Sheffield United at Villa Park on 22 December. They only managed to win a point in that game – and even that was salvaged by a goal deep into injury time. This was followed by a disappointing 3-2 defeat at Manchester United in a game they led 2-0 at half-time. A late 3-2 home win over struggling Burnley on 30 December has ended that two-game winless streak, but with Liverpool and Man City starting to kick on, Villa’s best hope could be a top-four finish. They are still well-placed to do this, with 69.4% of current Opta supercomputer season simulations seeing them finish inside the top four, behind Man City (99.5%), Liverpool (98.2%) and Arsenal (80.8%). Tottenham (35.5%) and West Ham – 10.1% before tonight’s meeting with Brighton – are slight outsiders, with Manchester United way behind. Erik ten Hag’s side finished inside the top four places of the Premier League in just 0.6% of the current 10,000 season sims. With all the drama of a Christmas special, the Premier League title race threw up some more twists and turns on Matchdays 18 and 19. All but four teams have now reached the halfway stage, and leading the way at the top of the table are Liverpool, who followed up their 1-1 draw with Arsenal with a 2-0 win at Burnley on Boxing Day. Early and late goals, respectively, from Darwin Núñez and a returning Diogo Jota at Turf Moor gave Jürgen Klopp’s men all three points, meaning they now have 13 more (42) than they did at this stage last season. The same cannot be said for Arsenal, whose point at Anfield would have seemed like a good one had it not been for their 2-0 defeat to West Ham at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday. Goals from Tomás Soucek and former Gunner Konstantinos Mavropanos handed Mikel Arteta’s men their third Premier League defeat of the campaign, and dented their title hopes in the process. They may be just two points off the top but have 10 fewer than they did at this stage last season. All this leaves Liverpool as comfortable second favourites for the title, with Klopp’s side now rated at 27.3% by the Opta supercomputer to go all the way. Arsenal have seen their title probability reduce by almost half compared to the last time we checked, though. On 18 December, their chances were rated at 29.9%; those have slid down to 15.3%. The big beneficiary of Arsenal’s slip-up is Manchester City. The defending Premier League champions missed out on MD 18 to go and win the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, before returning to resume normal service as they eventually eased past Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. We say “normal service”. Prior to that game, City had only won one of their previous six league outings (D4 L1), and when Jack Harrison gave Everton the lead, Pep Guardiola may have been fearing the worst. However, second-half goals from Phil Foden, Julián Álvarez and Bernardo Silva secured a much-needed win for City, who keep their tag as heavy favourites for the title despite being five points from the summit. The Opta supercomputer hands them a 55.1% chance of making it a record four titles in a row from here, well up from the 39.3% it stood at when they left for Saudi Arabia, showing just how beneficial the draw between Liverpool and Arsenal was for them, coupled with their own victory at Everton and Arsenal’s subsequent loss to West Ham. Aston Villa’s recent wobble may have also helped slightly. Unai Emery’s side could have gone top with a win over Sheffield United at Villa Park on MD 18, but a shock draw with the Blades that brought their remarkable winning run at home to an end was followed up with a limp second-half display at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Villa raced out to a 2-0 lead against an out-of-sorts Manchester United, but hadn’t anticipated Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and, in particular, Alejandro Garnacho figuring out how to beat their offside trap. Failing to learn their lesson, they seemed helpless to stop United from turning the game around, with the hosts eventually winning 3-2 thanks to a Garnacho brace and Rasmus Højlund’s first Premier League goal. It seemed the supercomputer was finally starting to see Villa as potential champions after MD 17, but their 6.8% chance of winning the title has dropped back down to just 1.9%. Tottenham’s chances haven’t been hit as badly despite a defeat, but frankly that’s largely because they weren’t particularly fancied beforehand. They followed up their 2-1 win over Everton before Christmas with a 4-2 loss at Brighton on Thursday, reducing their likelihood of winning the title from 0.4% to 0.3%. West Ham arguably had the best Christmas period, securing wins against both Man Utd and Arsenal. That has actually seen the supercomputer make them the only other Premier League team deemed worthy of the slightest of chances of winning the title. Granted, it’s just 0.01%, but you’ve all seen the Jim Carrey meme. As for top-four chances, the supercomputer still seems relatively certain about three of the final four. Man City (99.2%), Liverpool (97.1%) and Arsenal (93.8%) all finished in the top four in well over 90% of the 10,000 simulations, while Villa (65.8%) still have a very good chance if they can get back to winning ways. Tottenham (30.5%) are the only other team with a greater than 6% chance of forcing their way in, ahead of West Ham (5.9%), Brighton (3.2%), Man Utd (2.4%) and Newcastle (1.8%). In recent seasons, title races in the Premier League have often just been ‘you win, we win’ week after week, making for a tense and consistent battle. In December, we have been having the added spice of teams in the title race not winning every game, and what glorious drama it is providing. Granted, there was little glorious drama at Anfield on Sunday as Manchester United became the first team to stop Liverpool from scoring in a game this season, and also the first to stop them from winning at home. The 0-0 draw was a blow to Liverpool’s title chances, but not for a lack of trying as Jürgen Klopp’s men fired 34 shots at United’s goal, their most shots without scoring in a Premier League game on record (since 2003-04), with the Reds’ previous highest 30 vs West Brom in 2012 and vs Stoke in 2008. It was also the fifth most by any team in the Premier League, with the most being Chelsea against West Ham in January 2014 (39). The Opta supercomputer has not looked favourably on Liverpool’s stalemate with their old rival, reducing their title chances from 31.5% to 23.6% as a result. That drop would have been even worse had it not been for another surprise result on Saturday, with Manchester City held 2-2 by Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium. All seemed to be going swimmingly for the defending champions despite missing Erling Haaland, with Jack Grealish and Rico Lewis putting them two up, before Jean-Philippe Mateta and a stoppage-time penalty from Michael Olise levelled things up for Palace. City had already taken quite a hit in recent weeks and were down at 47.8% before the weekend, but prior to Olise’s penalty the supercomputer had them at 57.3% to retain their title. Given the high expectation of them winning the game, it therefore had a significant impact when Olise scored, with Guardiola’s men now down to 39.3% to win the league for a record fourth time in a row. The big beneficiaries from the weekend were Arsenal, whose 2-0 win over Brighton at the Emirates Stadium saw them leapfrog Liverpool back to the top of the table, and also in the supercomputer percentages. Mikel Arteta’s men are closing in fast on Man City, now with a 29.9% chance of winning the title, up from just 16.6% last week. Aston Villa continue to rise in the supercomputer’s reckoning, albeit perhaps not quite as quickly as some may have anticipated. An impressive 2-1 comeback win for Unai Emery’s men in an action-packed encounter at Brentford raised their chances from 4.1% to 6.8%. Tottenham are keeping their rivals honest too, with their 2-0 win at Nottingham Forest on Friday seeing them rise from 0.1% to 0.4%. Put another good run of wins together over Christmas and Ange Postecoglou’s side could muscle their way back into the hunt. It’s reached that point of the season. As an early Christmas present, Opta Analyst brings you the first in what will be a weekly running blog between now and the end of the campaign, updating you on where we’re at with the Premier League title race. At the start of the season, we detailed how the Opta supercomputer saw Manchester City as overwhelming favourites to retain their crown, suggesting Pep Guardiola’s men won the title again in 90.2% of its 10,000 season simulations. However, in the last few weeks in particular, that percentage has significantly decreased. City uncharacteristically wobbled during a four-game run that saw them draw three and lose one against Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Aston Villa. In fact, it led to their chances more than halving to less than 45%, though Sunday’s comeback victory at Luton Town has boosted them back up slightly to 47.8%. That makes City fairly heavy favourites still, but new Premier League leaders Liverpool are coming up fast. It was only four games ago that Jürgen Klopp’s side won the title in just 9.3% of the supercomputer’s simulations, but now 16 games in, that has risen to 31.5%. That comes after City’s stumble and Liverpool’s run of three wins in a row after their 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium. They were not entirely convincing in any of those three wins it must be said, especially their 2-1 success at Crystal Palace on Saturday where they had looked anything but likely victors before Jordan Ayew’s red card. In typically ruthless fashion, though, Mohamed Salah – scoring his 200th Liverpool goal – and substitute Harvey Elliott turned it around, with Elliott smashing in the latest in a long line of stoppage-time winners the club has managed down the years in the Premier League. Having had just a 3.5% chance at the start of the season, it is certainly promising for Liverpool that they are up to winning the title almost a third of the time in the supercomputer’s simulations. It therefore hopefully won’t sound too patronising to Aston Villa to say that it’s also a huge achievement for them to be up to a 4.1% chance. Their 1-0 win over Arsenal on Saturday made it a historic 15th consecutive home victory in the league for the Midlands club and took them to within a point of Mikel Arteta’s men, and just two off the top. Few will have given Unai Emery’s men a chance at the start of the campaign, least of all the Opta supercomputer, with their likelihood standing at just 0.04% before a ball was kicked, and it was only up to 0.2% as recently as four games ago. Back-to-back home wins against Man City and Arsenal have pushed them up, though, and that percentage would surely be higher if it weren’t for the fact the supercomputer factors in performances in recent seasons, which could be why it still isn’t throwing more of its robo-weight behind them. Villa are certainly one to watch, though. Arsenal dropped to second place after Liverpool’s win and their defeat at Villa Park. Like Liverpool, Arteta’s side had been creeping up in the title percentages, as high as 26.4% following their late win at Luton last Tuesday. However, that has fallen to just 16.6% having lost two of their last four away games in the Premier League. Outside of the top four, the Opta supercomputer doesn’t give much hope to the chasing pack. Tottenham’s 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle United was a much-needed boost for Ange Postecoglou’s side, who had picked up just one point from their previous five games. It leaves them with a 0.06% chance of storming back to win the league, but they will be more optimistic about their chances of a top-four finish. The supercomputer gives Spurs a 13.3% chance of finishing inside the top four, behind the more obvious contenders of Man City (99%), Liverpool (97.4%), Arsenal (94.3%) and Villa (78.9%). Newcastle are the only other team given any chance of winning the Premier League, albeit only doing so in a rather miraculous 0.04% of simulations. That presumably requires them to get players back fit soon as their injury issues continue to take a toll. Back-to-back three-goal defeats at Everton and Spurs in the last week have been a huge blow, but Eddie Howe’s men are still given an 11.2% chance of finishing in the top four again. That’s more than can be said for Manchester United, whose topsy-turvy campaign took another dip with a 3-0 humiliation at Old Trafford at the hands of Bournemouth on Saturday. Despite being ahead of Newcastle in the table, Erik ten Hag’s side are given just a 1.7% chance of finishing in the top four, below even Brighton (3%) in the supercomputer’s reckoning. It promises to be a rollercoaster Christmas period, and prior to the weekend, we looked at the fixture difficulty for each Premier League team between now and the end of December. • Opta’s League Prediction model estimates the likelihood of teams finishing in each position in the competition.

The UEFA Champions League season in 2023-24 promises to be one of the best in recent memory. Manchester City won their first ever UCL title in 2022-23 thanks to a 1-0 win over Internazionale, but can they become just the second club to retain the Champions League trophy after Real Madrid’s three successive titles between 2016 and 2018? With Europe’s biggest and best clubs competing, it’ll be a tough task. Our AI-powered supercomputer will be making its Opta Predictions for every fixture over the course of what looks set to be an exciting UCL season. Read on, as Opta Analyst provides its UEFA Champions League match predictions and be sure to check back here ahead of each matchday. The UEFA Champions League returns this week after a two-month break, with the first set of last 16 ties in the competition involving eight of the clubs. Holders Manchester City are one of the eight teams in action this week, as they travel to Denmark, while Spanish giants Real Madrid also face a tricky away trip.  We look over the Opta supercomputer match predictions for all four of this week’s ties. This will be the fifth competitive meeting between FC Copenhagen, making just their second appearance in the Champions League knockout stage, and Man City. The reigning UCL and Premier League champions have never been beaten by the Danish side, though they were held to draws in two matches (2-2 in the 2008-09 UEFA Cup, 0-0 in the 2022-23 Champions League). City have never won away against Danish opponents in major European competition, drawing with Copenhagen twice and losing to Aalborg BK in 2009, though they did beat FC Midtjylland in a qualifier for the UEFA Cup back in 2008. That being said, City are overwhelming favourites to break that duck on Tuesday, with our predictor model handing them a 71% chance of victory. Copenhagen’s chances are rated at a slim 11.3%.  Of the remaining teams, Copenhagen are the least likely to win the Champions League based on the Opta predictor, which gives just a 0.05% chance of them lifting the title. Their chances of making the quarter-finals are just 6.1%. The differential between City and Copenhagen in our Global Opta Power Rankings is also the largest among the round of 16 match-ups. Interestingly, despite winning the trophy last year, City have not won any of their last five away games in the UEFA Champions League knockout stages (D4 L1), since beating Sporting CP 5-0 in the round of 16 in 2021-22. They are, though, on an eight-game winning streak in the UCL, the longest run by an English side in European Cup/Champions League history. The last team to have a longer run were Bayern, between 2019 and 2020 (15). Copenhagen did, of course, stun the other team from Manchester in the group stage, coming from behind to beat Manchester United 4-3 at the Parken Stadium thanks to a late strike from 18-year-old Roony Bardghji. The only teenager to score against two different English clubs in the Champions League is Kylian Mbappé (Man City and Liverpool), while Bardghji is aiming to be the first to do so in the same season. Erling Haaland returned to scoring form after his injury lay-off with a double against Everton on Saturday, but he is not the only attacker Copenhagen will have to look out for – Julián Álvarez has been involved in six goals in his last five Champions League appearances (five goals, one assist), despite only starting one of these matches. The Argentine is averaging a goal or assist every 62 minutes in the competition, and one every 31 minutes this term. La Liga leaders Real Madrid are given a 43.5% chance of winning the first leg of their tie with RB Leipzig, but Los Blancos have been dealt a blow after Jude Bellingham suffered an ankle injury in Saturday’s big win over Girona – a match in which the England international scored twice. It will be a real test for Madrid, given Bellingham leads all players in the Champions League this season for chances created following a carry (nine) and via a line-breaking pass (six) and chances created from open play in general (15). He has directly contributed to a goal in all five of his appearances for Madrid in the competition, with four goals and three assists to his name – no player has been involved in more goals in the competition so far this season. While Madrid, who won all six of their group matches, are well fancied over the two legs (72.8% chance of progressing), Leipzig’s chances are not bad either – at 27.2% – so do not be surprised if the Bundesliga team cause Carlo Ancelotti’s side problems. Loïs Openda has proved to be a fantastic addition – he has already scored four Champions League goals this term, with only Christopher Nkunku (seven in 2021-22) netting more in a single campaign for Leipzig. Xavi Simons, meanwhile, continues to impress. Two of his seven goals for Leipzig this term have come in the Champions League, with the Netherlands international more than capable of the spectacular. He has also provided two assists in the competition, from 12 chances created. Madrid are on their longest winning run in the Champions League since a run of 10 games between April 2014 and February 2015, while they have progressed from 11 of their last 13 round of 16 ties, reaching at least the semi-finals in each of the last three campaigns since losing at this stage to Man City in 2019-20. Los Blancos have lost just one of their last 15 Champions League matches against German sides (W10 D4), though that was a 3-2 loss at Leipzig in last season’s competition. They have not been eliminated by German opponents since the 2012-13 semi-finals, when they were defeated by Borussia Dortmund. This is Leipzig’s fourth appearance in the Champions League knockout stages, but it is the first time they are not facing an English opponent in the round of 16. Among the eight teams that finished second in their group and therefore will host the first leg, Paris Saint-Germain, along with Inter, are the only sides with over a 50% chance of reaching the quarter-finals. Real Sociedad head to the Parc des Princes on Wednesday, with the Spanish side having gone unbeaten through the group stage, whereas PSG rather bundled their way through the ‘group of death’, squeezing in ahead of Milan and Newcastle United on Matchday 6. PSG are, however, made the favourites to win the first leg (55%). Luis Enrique was able to rest Kylian Mbappé in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Lille. The France star has scored in each of his last five Champions League appearances against Spanish opposition, netting seven goals in total in these matches. In fact, Mbappé is the last player to score a hat-trick against a Spanish side in the knockout stages of the competition, having done so against Barcelona back in February 2021 (for PSG in the round of 16). The 25-year-old has scored 43 goals in 67 appearances in the Champions League. Should Mbappé find the net in this game, he will overtake Raúl as the the player to have scored the second-most UCL goals while aged 25 or under, with only Lionel Messi (59) netting more than those two. Mbappé is being strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid in the summer, and if this is indeed going to be his final season in Paris, then he will want to go out by being the player that finally dragged them to a Champions League crown, albeit their chances of winning the title are rated at just 6.4%. PSG\\xa0failed to win any of their last three group stage games (D2 L1). They last went four Champions League games without a win in the same campaign between MD6 and the quarter-final in 2014-15 (D2 L3). They will have to get past a stern test in the form of Real Sociedad, too – Imanol Alguacil’s team kept more clean sheets (four), conceded fewer goals (two) and faced fewer shots on target (12) than any other side in this year’s group stage. Expect plenty of high pressing in this game, from both teams. Real Sociedad have forced 70 high turnovers already in the Champions League (11.6 per game), while PSG have the lowest PPDA (opposition passes per defensive action) average (8.3) in the tournament, with La Real second on 9.6. Real Sociedad’s only previous appearance in the Champions League knockout stages was in 2003-04 – they lost 1-0 in both legs of the last 16 to French side Lyon. However, after reaching the final in 2020 and the semi-finals in 2021, PSG have been eliminated at the round-of-16 stage in the last two seasons. Bayern were hammered 3-0 by Bayer Leverkusen in a huge Bundesliga title clash on Saturday, but Thomas Tuchel’s team are nevertheless big favourites to come away from Stadio Olimpico with a victory when they face Lazio. Their chances of winning the first leg against the Serie A side are rated at 56.7%, with Lazio given a 20.3% likelihood of success. Bayern have progressed from 11 of their last 12 Champions League round-of-16 ties, with the exception coming against eventual champions Liverpool in 2018-19. They have avoided defeat in the first leg of these ties in each of the last 11 campaigns (W7 D4). Having been eliminated from four of their first five Champions League knockout ties against Italian sides (including the 2010 final against Inter), Bayern have now progressed from each of their last three. They are unbeaten in 12 games against Italian teams, since a 3-2 home loss to Inter in March 2011. The only previous meetings between Lazio and Bayern came in the 2020-21 Champions League round of 16, with the German side winning both legs (4-1 away, 2-1 at home). No player has been involved in more goals in this season’s competition than Harry Kane (seven – four goals, three assists). Only in 2017-18 (nine) has the England captain been involved in more in a single campaign. However, Lazio – who are making just their third appearance in the knockout stage of the UCL – have a star forward of their own. Of the 10 players to have scored five or more goals for Lazio in the Champions League, Ciro Immobile has the best minutes-per-goal ratio (99). The Italian has netted eight times in 11 such appearances for the club, with only Simone Inzaghi scoring more overall (15 goals in 31 appearances).

Is the worry justified? UEFA coefficients. Depending on where you’re from, it’s either something you barely know anything about, or something you hear about every other week. And if you’re from England, Spain, Germany or Italy, for the past decade you’ve had every reason not to care. However, the times they are a-changin’. UEFA has announced its new Champions League format, which we’ll see in action for the first time next season. In this new iteration, the number of participating teams will increase from 32 to 36, together with a completely new group stage format. So where do these four additional teams come from? This is where things become interesting. One additional spot is given to the association in fifth place in the country coefficient rankings. This year, this is looking to be a battle between the number five nation of the past seven years, France, and new challengers, the Netherlands. Another additional spot is given to the ‘champions path’ qualifiers, where winners of domestic leagues without a direct group stage ticket battle it out every year. And finally, two additional spots are given to the associations with the best collective European performance in the previous season. That is, the current season if we’re talking about next year’s Champions League. Last term, for example, the two best associations were England and Spain. If that were to repeat this year, the fifth placed team in both the Premier League and La Liga will get a direct Champions League ticket next season. With this change, the UEFA coefficients have become relevant for every country in Europe — including the top four nations England, Spain, Germany, Italy. So, let’s refresh your memory: what are UEFA coefficients? Every year teams from Europe play in the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League. Since quality differs wildly even within these competitions, UEFA long ago decided that some associations get more tickets than others. In order to determine this, they invented the UEFA coefficients. Essentially, if a team from your association gets results in Europe, you get points: two points for a win, one for a draw. All points together make up a nation’s coefficient. To keep things fair, this total is divided by the number of participating clubs from your nation. That way, countries that get fewer tickets to Europe can still compete with nations that get more. At the end of each European season, all nations are sorted by their total coefficient over the last five years — countries at the top get the most/best tickets, nations at the bottom will only get a couple and will need to play a lot of qualifiers. For fans from most countries, this is of utmost importance; it can be the difference between playing in the Champions League via a direct ticket or getting knocked out in qualifiers — and potentially European football altogether — in June or July. This season has seen a lot of dramatic movement across the rankings: Further down we can also see much going on: Historically, however, it’s not been that exciting at the top. The top four nations get the same allocation, and since they’ve been the same quartet for the past 15 years, fans from England, Italy, Spain and Germany have had little reason to pay attention to their nation’s coefficient. But as mentioned before, that’s now changed. In the new UCL format, an additional ticket will be given to each of the two nations with the highest coefficient from the current year only. That means that there’s now a very good reason for fans from these countries to start paying attention. They are top of the ranking for a reason, and therefore they are generally most likely to end in the top two of the yearly ranking as well. Other nations can compete here, but only sporadically. The Netherlands made the top two in 2021-22, and Portugal were top in 2010-11. This year, Turkish clubs started the season well and back in mid-October, Turkey were being given an 18.1% chance of getting a bonus UCL group stage place in 2024-25. However, it’s near impossible now, with it looking most likely to be given to two of England, Italy and Germany. England are still simulated to have the best chance of getting that extra place in next season’s Champions League (into the league stage, not into qualifying) by the Opta calculations.  Despite Newcastle and Manchester United finishing bottom of their UCL groups and not even qualifying for the Europa League knockout round, six of the remaining eight English clubs are still in European competition – Manchester City, Arsenal, Brighton, Liverpool, Aston Villa and West Ham. This means that England are projected to have a 77% chance of getting one of those two spots and that would mean fifth position in the Premier League this season has a strong chance of being enough for a place in the Champions League in 2024-25. That is great news for teams like Manchester United, Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, West Ham and Brighton – the latter two having never played in the Champions League before.  The fight for the other ticket for an extra UCL league stage place looks most likely to be between Italy (50.4%) and Germany (48.3%), with Italy currently having more coefficient points this season than every other nation (14.0), but projected by Opta to eventually finish behind England (18.4 vs 19.4) at the end of 2023-24.  France are in with a shout (9.9% chance), but will need English, Spanish and Italian clubs to have disastrous knockout stage campaigns and for their remaining six clubs (Paris Saint-Germain in the UCL as well as Marseille, Toulouse, Rennes, Lens and Lille) to progress very far into each tournament they are involved in.

We look ahead to the game with our Crystal Palace vs Chelsea prediction and preview. The natives are restless at Crystal Palace, and it’s easy to see why. A run of two wins from their last 14 games across all competitions (four draws, eight defeats) has led many supporters to call for the dismissal of manager Roy Hodgson, who looks to be on thin ice ahead of Monday’s meeting with Chelsea. With the Blues also toiling in the bottom half, both sides are in desperate need of a win to rejuvenate their league campaigns. If Hodgson thought a 3-2 victory over Sheffield United on Matchday 22 would stave off questions about his future, he was wrong. Palace were trounced 4-1 by rivals Brighton and Hove Albion just four days later, going 3-0 down within 34 minutes on a miserable trip to the south coast. Hodgson’s problems continued to mount in the second half when star player Michael Olise lasted just 11 minutes as a half-time substitute, having suffered what Hodgson described as a “serious” hamstring injury. Palace also lost Eberechi Eze to a muscle problem against Sheffield United, leaving them without their two star players for Monday’s game. The Eagles have won just one of their six Premier League games this season with neither Olise nor Eze in their starting lineup (one draw, four defeats), beating Burnley 2-0 in November. Between them, Olise (six) and Eze (five) have scored 42.3% of Palace’s Premier League goals in 2023-24 (11/26). The bad news doesn’t stop there for Palace fans, with former Chelsea defender Marc Guéhi also sidelined after sustaining a knee injury last time out. His absence will come as a major blow to a defence enduring the Premier League’s longest ongoing run without a clean sheet (12 games), conceding 27 goals in these matches. It is Palace’s longest run without a Premier League shutout since a 15-match stretch between September and December 2020. Chelsea’s defence has also been breached with regularity of late, with Mauricio Pochettino under renewed pressure after the Blues followed a 4-1 loss at Liverpool with a 4-2 defeat to Wolves at a disgruntled Stamford Bridge. Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in that game, only for a Matheus Cunha hat-trick and an Axel Disasi own goal to put the contest beyond them before Thiago Silva headed in a late consolation. The Blues did play much better in a 3-1 win at Aston Villa in the FA Cup in midweek, though, with goals from Conor Gallagher, Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernández guiding them to victory in Wednesday’s fourth-round replay. It’s in the Premier League where Chelsea need results, though, with the Wolves defeat plunging them into 11th place in the table. They will start a Premier League game in the bottom half for the 12th time this season on Monday, their most in a single campaign since 2015-16 (26). They have, however, won six of their last seven matches when starting in the bottom half (one draw), while only winning two of 12 games this term when sitting in the top half (two draws, eight defeats). Pochettino also tends to enjoy facing Palace, winning 12 of his 14 Premier League meetings with the Eagles (one draw, one defeat), more than against any other opponent. Hodgson, meanwhile, has lost all six of his Premier League clashes with Pochettino, with Jürgen Klopp (nine games) the only manager he has faced more often in the competition without ever winning. There has been plenty of talk about the way in which Chelsea have underperformed their underlying numbers this season; ahead of Matchday 24, Opta’s expected points model suggested the Blues should be fifth in the table with at least 38 points, based on their underlying data. If Chelsea’s results are to improve, Christopher Nkunku could have a major role to play. He should return to the lineup after being rested in midweek, having been eased back after recovering from a hip problem. Both of his Premier League goals have come as a substitute in defeats to Wolves (2-1 in December) and Liverpool (4-1 last month). He is one of just two players to net in multiple Premier League games for Chelsea while losing both, alongside Laurent Charvet.  Jackson could partner Nkunku in attack after impressing against Villa, but Reece James, Robert Sánchez and Roméo Lavia are still absent, while Benoît Badiashile limped off in the win at Villa Park on Wednesday with a groin problem. Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah are nearing returns, though Monday may come too early for them. Palace have a truly dismal recent record against Chelsea. In fact, their current 12-game losing streak against the Blues in league action is their longest run against a specific opponent in their history. Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke were on target for Chelsea as they won the return fixture 2-1 at Stamford Bridge on 27 December, the latter scoring a decisive penalty one minute from time. Chelsea now have a chance to make a piece of club history on Monday, having never previously recorded 13 successive league wins against one team.  The Blues also hit a late winner on their most recent visit to Selhurst Park, with former Palace loanee Gallagher scoring the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory for Graham Potter’s side back in October 2022. Despite Palace’s poor overall form, they have actually won their last two league games at Selhurst Park, beating Brentford 3-1 in late December and Sheffield United 3-2 last month. They last won three successive home Premier League matches in October 2022, while they have never previously scored three or more goals in three straight home games in the top flight. Chelsea have lost their last two league games, last suffering more successive top-flight defeats between April and May 2023 when they endured a four-match losing streak under interim boss Frank Lampard.  Following miserable defensive performances against Liverpool and Wolves, the Blues could also concede four or more goals in three consecutive league games for the first time since December 1989. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer favours Chelsea ahead of this meeting between two struggling teams, with the Blues winning 40.4% of our pre-match simulations. That does mean Palace are assigned a 59.6% chance of taking something from the game, however, with the Eagles victorious in 30.4% of scenarios and earning a draw in 29.2%. The supercomputer’s overall season predictions do not make for encouraging reading for supporters of either club at present. Palace are relegated to the Championship in 9% of scenarios, though 15th (17.7%) is viewed as the Eagles’ most likely final position.  Chelsea, meanwhile, finish 11th in a league-high 22.6% of scenarios. At 53.6%, the Blues’ chances of a top-half finish are slightly better than one-in-two, but they only finish in the top seven, securing European qualification, in 9.2% of our season simulations.

Look ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations final with our Nigeria vs Ivory Coast prediction and preview. Ivory Coast came within a hair’s breadth of elimination at the group stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations a little over two weeks ago; now, the host nation are preparing to once again go up against Nigeria in Sunday’s final at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpé, highlighting a remarkable change in their fortunes. The Elephants’ dismal showing in Group A had them on the verge of complete humiliation, to the extent that head coach Jean-Louis Gasset was incredibly dismissed mid-tournament and before the team knew if they’d be playing in the knockout stages. As it happened, their 2-0 win over Guinea-Bissau on Matchday 1 proved crucial, with the three points won from that game just enough to take them through as one of the four best third-place finishers after losing to Nigeria and then Equatorial Guinea. The latter crushed Ivory Coast 4-0 to inflict their worst-ever AFCON defeat and seal Gasset’s fate. Had Ghana held on to beat Mozambique later the same day, Ivory Coast would have ultimately been knocked out, but the Black Stars surrendered a 2-0 goal lead in second-half stoppage time – the margins couldn’t have been finer. Ivory Coast’s passage through the knockouts hasn’t exactly been emphatic either, requiring extra time twice – going all the way to penalties against Senegal – before seeing off DR Congo 1-0 in the semi-finals, but the journey has taken amazingly brought them to the brink of glory under interim coach Emerse Faé. “It’s like a dream,” he said after beating DR Congo. “When you go back two weeks to the defeat here against Equatorial Guinea, it was hard then to imagine that we might qualify for the final of our own AFCON.” Nigeria, on the other hand, have looked strong bets to go deep into the tournament right from the start. While they haven’t blown anyone away, the Super Eagles’ progress has been built on a solid defence, conceding just two goals in six matches (excluding penalty shootouts). After comfortably finishing ahead of Ivory Coast in second in Group A with seven points, only behind Equatorial Guinea on goal difference, Nigeria beat Cameroon 2-0 in the last 16 and Angola 1-0 in the quarter-finals, Ademola Lookman scoring all three goals across those games. They were pushed all the way by South Africa in Wednesday’s last-four clash, with Teboho Mokoena’s 90th-minute penalty cancelling out William Troost-Ekong’s own spot-kick to take the game to extra time. Nigeria then managed to get the job done in a shootout, winning 4-2. This will be Nigeria’s first appearance in the final since beating Burkina Faso in the 2013 showpiece and only their second this century, having lost to Cameroon in 2000. Success on Sunday will see them go level with Ghana on four AFCON titles, a tally only bettered by Cameroon (five) and Egypt (seven), whereas Ivory Coast are looking to tie the Super Eagles’ three continental titles. If Faé’s men are successful, they’ll be the first host nation to win the Africa Cup of Nations since Egypt in 2006. Tunisia also did in the tournament before that in 2004. Our tournament Opta team stats below allow you to compare the two AFCON 2023 finalists. No side at AFCON 2023 have attempted more shots following a high turnover of possession than Ivory Coast (7), with the host nation having more than double the tally of open-play passing sequences of 10+ passes than Nigeria. Nigeria and Ivory Coast will be meeting for the eighth time at the Africa Cup of Nations (three wins for Nigeria, two for Ivory Coast, D2), including in all three AFCON editions where the Super Eagles have won the competition (group stage draw in 1980, a 4-2 Nigeria win on pens after a 2-2 semi-final draw in 1994 and a 2-1 Nigeria win in the quarter-finals in 2013). Of course, they’ve also already played once in this tournament, with Nigeria winning 1-0 on Matchday 2 of Group A thanks to a Troost-Ekong penalty – that was their only shot on target in what was a closely fought encounter, though the Super Eagles arguably just about deserved the victory. That group clash was their first contest in any capacity since a January 2015 friendly, which Ivory Coast edged 1-0. The Opta supercomputer calculates the 2023 AFCON final to be Nigeria’s to lose. José Peseiro’s men came out on top inside 90 minutes in 44.2% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations, making them favourites – as they have been for a while now – by a considerable margin. Ivory Coast shouldn’t be completely overlooked, though, with the prediction model giving them a 30.2% chance of besting their opponents without requiring extra time. An additional 30 minutes was required in just over a quarter (25.6%) of the simulations, however. When that and the potential for penalties is taken into account, Nigeria’s likelihood of success is even higher. Ivory Coast are in with more than just a fighting chance though – they have home advantage as well, for what it’s worth. Despite being considered favourites now, Nigeria weren’t always ahead of the competition. In fact, in our pre-tournament simulations, their 8.0% probability of going all the way was bettered by five teams, including Ivory Coast. At 12.1% back then, the Elephants were rated as second favourites behind Senegal (12.8%). The tables may have turned over the past few weeks, making Ivory Coast unfancied in the eyes of some. But they’ve defied the odds in getting this far; what’s stopping them doing so again on Sunday?

Who will come out on top? We look ahead to the game with our Aston Villa vs Manchester United prediction and preview. Whisper it quietly, but Manchester United may just be back in the race for UEFA Champions League qualification. With key players returning to fitness and youngsters finding their feet, the Red Devils are unbeaten in five games across all competitions in 2024 (four wins, one draw) and enter Matchday 24 sixth in the Premier League table, eight points adrift of their next opponents – fourth-placed Aston Villa. Three days on from a pulsating 4-3 victory over Wolves, Erik ten Hag’s men eased past West Ham 3-0 at Old Trafford last Sunday, with Rasmus Højlund opening the scoring before Alejandro Garnacho helped himself to a brace. Having also beaten Newport County 4-2 in the FA Cup in late January, United have now won three successive games across all competitions for the first time since October, doing so while netting three or more goals in each match for the first time since January 2023. The improved form of Højlund and Garnacho has been crucial to United’s upturn in front of goal. Across their last five Premier League games, the Red Devils have scored 13 goals, converting 20% of their 65 shots. In the five matches that preceded this run, they netted just twice with a conversion rate of 3% (73 shots). Having failed to net in his first 14 Premier League games, Højlund has now scored in four successive league appearances, a run that started with his winning goal in the reverse fixture against Villa on Boxing Day. He is the youngest player to score in four straight Premier League games for United, and the only Danish player to have achieved that feat in the competition overall. Garnacho’s tally of five Premier League goals this term, meanwhile, has only been bettered by Scott McTominay (six) among United players (Marcus Rashford also has five). The Argentinian livewire has also recorded 34 chance-creating carries in the competition this season, a tally that puts him second only to Manchester City star Phil Foden (38). Garnacho’s international teammate Lisandro Martínez has been sidelined again after suffering a medial collateral ligament injury, while fellow defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka had to withdraw from training on Thursday and won’t make Sunday’s game. \\xa0 Martínez’s absence leaves Ten Hag with a selection dilemma at the heart of his defence. United’s rearguard has not looked particularly solid this season, with only Sheffield United (390), West Ham (376) and Luton Town (371) facing more shots in the Premier League than their 355. Their average of 15.4 shots faced per game is United’s most in a single campaign on record (since 2003-04), though Villa are averaging 14.6 attempts per match, also their most in a Premier League season on record. Villa certainly had their shooting boots on last Saturday as they dismantled Sheffield United in a 5-0 win at Bramall Lane. With John McGinn, Ollie Watkins, Leon Bailey, Youri Tielemans and Álex Moreno all on target, Villa had five different goalscorers in a Premier League game (excluding own goals) for the first time since a 5-1 win over Bolton Wanderers in November 2009. They have now won three Premier League games by a margin of four or more goals this season (also 4-0 vs Everton and 6-1 vs Brighton and Hove Albion), as many as they managed in their previous three campaigns combined. They were brought back down to earth on Wednesday, however, exiting the FA Cup with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea in a fourth-round replay at Villa Park, with Moussa Diaby’s late strike a mere consolation after Conor Gallagher, Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernández struck for the Blues. Villa have now lost back-to-back home games across all competitions, having lost just one of their previous 22 at Villa Park in a run dating back to last February (20 wins, one draw). The omens are good for Emery, however, with United coming to town. The Spaniard has won both of his home Premier League games against them, winning 2-0 with Arsenal in March 2019 and 3-1 in his first game in charge of Villa in November 2022. He could now become the first-ever manager to win his first three home Premier League matches against United. In Watkins, he can call upon one of the Premier League’s form players. Watkins has 38 goal involvements in 47 Premier League games under Emery (24 goals, 14 assists), averaging one every 107 minutes. Of all Villa players to play at least 1,000 minutes under a specific manager in the competition, only Christian Benteke under Tim Sherwood has a better rate (one every 96 minutes). United overturned a 2-0 half-time deficit when the teams last met on Boxing Day, with Garnacho grabbing a second-half brace before Højlund hit the winner at a jubilant Old Trafford. The Red Devils also have a strong record at Villa Park, winning on 17 of their 28 previous trips there in the Premier League. Only United themselves – with 19 victories over Everton at Goodison Park – have more away wins over a specific opponent in the competition. Villa did win this exact fixture 3-1 last season, however, ending a 23-game winless run in the Premier League against United at Villa Park. They last won consecutive home league games against United between 1966 and 1977, posting five victories in a row. Villa Park has been a fortress for much of Emery’s reign, but the Villans’ home form has tailed off somewhat lately. Since winning 15 straight home league games between March and December 2023, Villa have only won one of their last three, drawing with Sheffield United and losing to Newcastle. They were also defeated on home soil in the FA Cup against Chelsea in midweek. They have conceded six goals across those three league matches, just one fewer than they shipped during their entire 15-game winning run (seven). United, meanwhile, have won their last three away games across all competitions, having failed to win any of their previous five on the road beforehand (two draws, three losses). Sunday’s visitors also tend to enjoy this time of year. They are unbeaten in 24 Premier League games in the month of February (15 wins, 9 draws) since losing 1-0 to Newcastle in 2018 under José Mourinho.

Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Sunday’s game appears a difficult one to call with both sides desperate to land a blow in the race for Europe, but the Opta supercomputer makes Villa slight favourites with their home advantage. Of 10,000 match simulations conducted by the supercomputer ahead of kick-off, Villa won 39%, with United triumphing in 32.1% and 28.9% finishing all square. The supercomputer is also backing Villa to finish above United in our 2023-24 predictions. Emery’s men clinch a top-four finish in 57.9% of season simulations, with United given just a 3.1% chance of doing so. Fourth (45.3%) is deemed Villa’s most likely position, while United finish sixth in a league-high 28% of scenarios. Enjoy this?

Here, we look ahead to the Gunners’ next task with our West Ham vs Arsenal prediction and preview. Having blown the Premier League title race wide open, Arsenal will be aiming to build on their impressive victory over league-leading Liverpool when they visit West Ham at London Stadium for Sunday’s capital-city derby. Mikel Arteta’s men sliced a five-point deficit with Jürgen Klopp’s Reds to two at the top-flight summit after a 3-1 triumph at Emirates Stadium last Sunday. Bukayo Saka tapped in a simple opener after Alisson denied Kai Havertz’s gilt-edged chance before William Saliba’s miscommunication allowed Luis Díaz to prod against Gabriel Magalhães for a disappointing first-half leveller. However, Arsenal roared back for a statement victory – reminding Liverpool, Manchester City and Aston Villa of their title credentials – after Alisson, aided by Virgil van Dijk’s error, was twice at fault for second-half strikes from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. Trossard is averaging a goal or assist every 99 minutes for Arsenal in the Premier League (six goals, 11 assists in 1,684 minutes). Only Thierry Henry (one every 86) and Robin van Persie (98) have a better minutes-per-goal-involvement average for the Gunners than Trossard (minimum 1,000 minutes). Saka’s form and the impact of Trossard, alongside the impressive Martinelli, in Gabriel Jesus’ injury-enforced absence will have Arteta optimistic. Arsenal sit third in the league table – level on points with Man City, who have a game in hand – ahead of what is turning into a tantalising title race. Jesus could also return from a troublesome knee issue for Sunday’s kick-off against West Ham, though Oleksandr Zinchenko limped off against Liverpool after a recurrence of his calf injury. The rest of Arteta’s team news largely remains the same: Fábio Vieira, Thomas Partey and Jurriën Timber are still sidelined, although Takehiro Tomiyasu may return to the squad after elimination from the Asian Cup with Japan. As for Sunday’s hosts, West Ham slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Matchday 23, Alejandro Garnacho scoring twice after Rasmus Højlund’s pinpoint opener. Alphonse Areola was withdrawn at half-time as a precaution for a head injury sustained in a collision with Kurt Zouma, though is expected to return and move Lukasz Fabianski back to the bench. United’s dominant success over David Moyes’ side last weekend saw Erik ten Hag’s side leapfrog West Ham into sixth, with the Hammers sitting seventh but just eight points behind fifth-placed Tottenham in the league table heading into Matchday 24. West Ham’s slide down the table has coincided with the absence of Mohammed Kudus, who returned against United after Africa Cup of Nations duty with Ghana, and Lucas Paquetá. The Brazilian’s thigh injury is unlikely to have improved considerably enough in time for kick-off against Arsenal. Michail Antonio remains as Moyes’ only other absentee. Moyes can at least continue to rely upon James Ward-Prowse, who has six assists for West Ham in the Premier League this season, including one for the Hammers’ second goal in their 2-0 win at Arsenal in the reverse fixture. Only in 2020-21 has the former Southampton midfielder delivered more assists in a single top-flight campaign (seven). West Ham are looking to complete the Premier League double over Arsenal for the first time since 2006-07 after their 2-0 win at Emirates Stadium in December, where Tomás Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos scored in an unlikely win. Alongside the Premier League triumph, the Hammers have also beaten Arsenal 3-1 in the EFL Cup this season when Ben White’s own goal and strikes from Kudus and Jarrod Bowen proved the difference. The last London side to beat the Gunners three times in the same campaign was Chelsea in 2005-06, while the only time West Ham have done so was in 1924-25. However, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 15 Premier League away games against West Ham (W9 D5), going down 1-0 in January 2019 thanks to Declan Rice. Moyes does not enjoy facing Sunday’s opponents either, having lost 22 of his 37 Premier League games against Arsenal (W5 D10), only suffering defeats more often against Liverpool (24). The former Manchester United and Everton manager is yet to beat Arsenal at home as West Ham boss in the competition, drawing three and losing one of his four games. East London comforts are aplenty for West Ham, who are unbeaten in their last six Premier League home games (W3 D3). They are yet to go seven without defeat at London Stadium in the competition, though, last going longer without a home league defeat in April 2016 at Upton Park under Slaven Bilic (15). Indeed, West Ham’s last home defeat came in a 1-0 reverse against Everton back in October, although Arteta’s side have started the new year in impressive form. Having failed to win their final three Premier League games in 2023 – drawing with Liverpool before defeats to West Ham and Fulham – Arsenal won their first three in 2024 against Palace, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. Only in 1935 have the Gunners ever won each of their first four league games in a calendar year. Watch out for late drama, too, with no team scoring more goals past the 90th minute in the Premier League this season than Arsenal’s eight heading into MD 24, while Arteta’s men are the only team yet to concede a 90th-minute goal in 2023-24. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Arsenal are seen as favourites by the Opta supercomputer, winning 43.5% of 10,000 pre-match simulations compared to a West Ham triumph in just 28.6% and the draw at 27.9%. Victory over Liverpool boosted Arsenal’s title chances to 7.3% in Opta’s end-of-season predictions ahead of MD 24, with the Reds (25.7%) and Manchester City (66.6%) ranking ahead of them. Meanwhile, West Ham have an unlikely 0.8% chance of finishing in the Premier League’s top four. A finishing positon of eighth – one below their current position – occurs the most often, in 20% of the same data-led simulations. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the Premier League clash with our Nottingham Forest vs Newcastle prediction and preview. Nottingham Forest are in danger of getting dragged back into the Premier League relegation battle as they still search for their first win of 2024 ahead of Newcastle United’s visit to the City Ground on Saturday. Nuno Espírito Santo seemed to have steadied the ship after his December appointment, leading his new side to an away victory at Newcastle before their roaring home success against Manchester United. However, Forest have since gone three league games without a win to start the new year, losing to Brentford and Arsenal before a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth last weekend. Callum Hudson-Odoi cancelled out Justin Kluivert’s early opener before Philip Billing’s 84th-minute red card at the Vitality Stadium on Matchday 23, leaving Forest – who could reportedly face a points deduction for alleged financial breaches with the Premier League – 16th in the league table and just two points clear of Everton in the relegation zone ahead of this weekend’s matches. Nuno’s plight has not been helped by a growing absentee list, with Ivory Coast trio Serge Aurier, Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangaré and Nigeria’s Ola Aina preparing to face one another in the Africa Cup of Nations final. Cheikhou Kouyaté and Divock Origi returned for the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Bristol City, with the loanee striker scoring in a 1-1 draw before a 5-3 penalty shootout victory for Forest on Wednesday. However, Chris Wood sat out of the Bournemouth draw and the midweek FA Cup clash due to a hamstring issue that could keep him out for two months. Wood has scored nine Premier League goals against sides he’s previously played for in the competition, including a sensational hat-trick against Newcastle earlier this term. Although not struggling near the bottom of the table like Saturday’s hosts, Newcastle have endured similar struggles this term after their top-four finish in 2022-23. Eddie Howe’s men have just one win in their last six Premier League games, though that came on Matchday 22 with a 3-1 victory at Aston Villa preceding their chaotic 4-4 home draw with resurgent Luton on Saturday. That St James’ Park madness on MD 23 means Newcastle have conceded at least three goals in six of their last nine Premier League matches, a concerning sign for Howe considering they only conceded 3+ goals in five of their previous 72 games before this. Sean Longstaff scored twice in the entertaining Luton spectacle before a late salvaging act was required from Kieran Trippier and the fit-again Harvey Barnes as Newcastle came back from 4-2 down. It was Longstaff’s first ever double in the Premier League, netting as many goals against Luton last weekend as in his previous 44 matches in the competition combined (two). Trippier created Longstaff’s seventh-minute opener, taking the England full-back to nine assists in the Premier League this season, only Villa’s Ollie Watkins (10) has provided more. The last Newcastle player to record double figures in a single top-flight campaign was Laurent Robert in 2001-02 (11). Howe may have to rely on the creativity of Trippier and set-piece opportunities once again against Forest’s frail defence after being hit with more injury issues. Anthony Gordon limped off with an ankle injury against Luton, joining Nick Pope, Joelinton, Matt Targett, Elliot Anderson, Alexander Isak and Sandro Tonali – the latter suspended for his gambling-related ban – on a hefty list of absentees. Joe Willock and Jamaal Lascelles could at least return for Saturday’s game, as Callum Wilson and Barnes did against Luton, as Newcastle aim to build on their ninth-place Premier League position. Forest are looking to complete a league double over Newcastle for the first time since 1977-78, when they won their one and only top-flight title, after Wood’s hat-trick inspired their 3-1 win at St James’ Park in December. However, Newcastle are unbeaten in their last seven top-flight away games against Forest (W3 D4), with their last such defeat at the City Ground coming in May 1987. The Magpies have lost two Championship games there in that time (2009 and 2016), though. The City Ground club historically struggled against ‘stronger’ teams but have improved; since their return to the Premier League last season, Forest have won three games against sides that finished in the top four the previous campaign, as many as they had in their first five seasons in the competition combined. Newcastle were victors in this exact fixture last season, though, winning 2-1 thanks to Isak’s double after Emmanuel Dennis – now on loan at Watford – opened the scoring in Nottingham. Newcastle’s 3-1 win against Villa in their last away game ended a seven-game winless run on the road in the Premier League (D2 L5). They last won consecutive away games in March/April last year, a run of three which included the 2-1 victory over Forest. Howe may fancy banishing those away-game struggles further as well, considering Forest have lost five of their last six Premier League home games (W1), as many as they had in their previous 24 matches at the City Ground since returning to the competition in 2022 (W10 D9). Indeed, defeat here would see Forest lose both of their opening two home league matches of a calendar year for the first time since 2018 (first three), after going down 2-1 to Arsenal at the end of January. Expect this to be another entertaining one, too, given Newcastle’s Premier League games have seen more goals scored (85) than any other side this season (F48 A37). Their 37 goals conceded is already four more than they shipped in the whole of 2022-23 (33). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite slim returns on the road, Newcastle are backed by the Opta supercomputer to win on Saturday, triumphing in 44.5% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations. Forest only secured their much-needed victory in 27.8%, with the draw evenly matched at 27.7% in the data-backed predictions, though the latter result would increase the pressure on Nuno. Only Sheffield United (99.6%), Burnley (95.8%) and Luton Town (32.3%) have higher chances of relegation than Forest’s 30.0% in Opta’s end-of-season projections, with Everton (21.2%) keeping close company. Meanwhile, at the other end of the table and hunting for Europe, Newcastle are currently forecast to finish seventh – two above their current position but outside the Champions League qualification spots.

How will the leaders respond to last Sunday’s defeat to Arsenal? Liverpool may enter Matchday 24 top of the Premier League table, but they will be glancing over their shoulders a little more nervously following last Sunday’s 3-1 defeat to Arsenal. With both the Gunners and Manchester City now breathing down their necks, Jürgen Klopp’s men need a response when they welcome struggling Burnley to Anfield on Saturday. The Reds were off the pace from the first whistle at the Emirates Stadium, falling behind to Bukayo Saka’s early strike and being fortunate to go into half-time all square at 1-1, with Luis Díaz’s industry forcing a calamitous own goal from Gabriel Magalhães. However, Liverpool ultimately got what they deserved from a game that saw them face their highest expected goals (xG) against total on record in the Premier League (3.5) and register their lowest xG in a league match this season (0.37). Uncharacteristic mistakes from Alisson and Virgil van Dijk cost them in the second half as Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard got on the scoresheet for the hosts, while Ibrahima Konaté’s late red card adds to Klopp’s selection headache for Saturday’s game. Despite seeing their 15-game unbeaten run in the Premier League come to a halt, Liverpool will be confident of returning to winning ways at Anfield, where they are unbeaten in 23 league matches (18 wins, five draws) since losing 2-1 to Leeds United in October 2022. They are hoping to be boosted by the return of Mohamed Salah soon, though this game could come too early following his hamstring injury sustained during Egypt’s disappointing Africa Cup of Nations campaign. Regardless of Salah’s availability, Klopp could opt to mix up his attack, with Darwin Núñez pushing for a recall after Cody Gakpo struggled against Arsenal. Núñez is always a whirlwind of activity, attempting more shots (73) than any other Premier League player this season, while Salah (33) is the only player in the division to better Núñez’s 32 attempts on target. The Uruguayan will be hoping to avoid hitting the woodwork, though, having done so nine times in the Premier League this season, at least six more than any other player. One man who is likely to keep his place is Diogo Jota, who has seven goal involvements in his last seven Premier League games (five goals, two assists), including a goal against Burnley in the reverse fixture on Boxing Day. He has also been involved in a goal in each of his last four league matches at Anfield, netting against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and Chelsea, and recording an assist against Newcastle United. Liverpool must assess the fitness of Dominik Szoboszlai, who missed last week’s game with a hamstring issue, while they will definitely be without the suspended Konaté and long-term absentee Joël Matip. Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah are competing to start at centre-back, with Andy Robertson eyeing a return to the lineup if Gomez is shifted infield from left-back. Burnley are the side tasked with breaching the Anfield fortress and facing a likely angry Liverpool. With seven points separating the Clarets from 17th-placed Luton Town, they are running out of time to mount a serious bid for survival. However, Vincent Kompany’s men did give themselves something to build on last week, recovering from two goals down to clinch a 2-2 draw against Fulham. Chelsea loanee David Datro Fofana was Burnley’s hero, netting twice after coming off the bench for his home debut. He has three goal involvements in just two league appearances for Kompany’s men (two goals, one assist), a tally only bettered by three other Clarets players this season (Lyle Foster – 7; Zeki Amdouni – 5; Wilson Odobert – 4). Burnley have attempted to preserve the patient, possession-based style of football in the Premier League that saw them run away with the Championship title last season, but Saturday’s game may call for a more pragmatic approach. James Trafford has made more passes (1,067) and more successful passes (694) than any other Premier League goalkeeper this season. The fact he has played more passes than any of his Burnley teammates, though, could be cause for concern for a side in desperate need of goals. Indeed, a lack of a penetration has been a key theme for Burnley, whose total of 15.8 xG from open play is the second-lowest figure in the Premier League this season, worse than everyone but Sheffield United (14.1). Burnley have also scored a league-high 29% (7/24) of their goals from outside the box this campaign, but no side has conceded fewer goals from outside the penalty area than Liverpool (one).  In terms of team news for the visitors, defensive trio Jordan Beyer, Hannes Delcroix and Charlie Taylor all missed the Fulham game with slight knocks but have a chance of making the trip to Merseyside. Liverpool have won eight of their last 10 Premier League games against Burnley (one draw, one defeat), winning the last four in a row by an aggregate score of 8-0. They took the reverse fixture by a 2-0 scoreline on Boxing Day, with Núñez and Jota on target at Turf Moor. Burnley have only won one of their last nine away league games against the Reds, drawing two and losing six. However, that victory – a 1-0 triumph in January 2021 – was a memorable one as an Ashley Barnes penalty ended Liverpool’s 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield in the Premier League. The Clarets, however, have not won any of their last 11 Premier League games against teams starting the day top of the table (five draws, six losses). Liverpool, meanwhile, are unbeaten in their last six against teams starting the day inside the relegation zone (four wins, two draws), though they did lose four of their previous six such matches before this run (two wins). Burnley’s struggles at Turf Moor have been well-documented, and they have actually won a Premier League-high 62% of their points on the road this season (8/13). However, Kompany’s men have only won one of their last eight away league games (one draw, six defeats), beating Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage in December. Across all competitions, Burnley are winless in six games since that triumph in west London, recording two draws and four defeats. Liverpool, meanwhile, have won their last four home games overall, scoring four or more goals in three of those matches (4-2 vs Newcastle, 5-2 vs Norwich City and 4-1 vs Chelsea), hitting the net 15 times overall during that run. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Liverpool are always heavily fancied at home and it’s no different this weekend, with the Opta supercomputer giving the Reds a 71.1% chance of victory. Only Man City (74.3% at home to Everton) are assigned a higher win probability on MD 24. Burnley took three points in just 9.5% of our pre-match simulations, with 19.4% finishing level. Liverpool were the major losers in the title race last weekend, with their defeat at the Emirates seeing their title chances fall by 15.3% in the supercomputer’s latest season predictions. The Reds’ title hopes now stand at 26.1%, compared to 66.2% for City and 7.4% for Arsenal.  Burnley, meanwhile, need a minor miracle to preserve their Premier League status, with the Clarets being relegated in 96.4% of the supercomputer’s season simulations, up by 1.1% from MD 23 despite their fightback against Fulham.

We look ahead to this Premier League game with our Tottenham vs Brighton preview and prediction. Tottenham will be looking to extend their four-game Premier League unbeaten run and boost their UEFA Champions League qualification hopes when they host Brighton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday. Having been dumped out at the FA Cup fourth round by Manchester City last month, alongside an EFL Cup second-round exit to Fulham back in August, Spurs’ hopes of silverware for the 2023-24 season have significantly diminished – despite a confident rebuttal from manager Ange Postecoglou that they can still win the Premier League. Postecoglou’s side have just a meagre 0.1% chance of their first top-flight title since 1961 – and a first piece of silverware since winning the EFL Cup in 2008 – compared to Aston Villa (0.3%), Arsenal (7.3%), Liverpool (25.7%) and favourites Manchester City (66.6%) in Opta’s end-of-season predictions from 10,000 data-backed simulations. A more realistic target may be qualifying for the Champions League. Tottenham sit fifth in the table heading into Matchday 24, two points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa, five adrift of Arsenal and Man City and only seven away from Premier League leaders Liverpool. That gap to the top four would have been smaller if not for a 2-2 draw against Everton at Goodison Park in Saturday’s early kick-off, where Jarrad Branthwaite capitalised on Cristian Romero’s accidental flick-on to score a 94th-minute equaliser. That last-gasp leveller was Tottenham’s eighth goal conceded in the 90th minute or later this season, their most in a single Premier League campaign and the most of any side in the division this term. Richarlison had earlier twice found the net against his former employers on MD 23, either side of Jack Harrison’s first-half equaliser, taking the Brazilian striker to nine goals in his last eight Premier League games – the most goals in the league since the start of December. It was also his sixth brace in the competition overall, of which half have come at Goodison Park (3/6). Postecoglou may be grateful for the form of Richarlison – whose only blank in that impressive run came against Brighton – given the absence of Son Heung-min, who could come back for Saturday after South Korea were knocked out of the Asian Cup by Jordan in Tuesday’s semi-final. Spurs’ lineup will also be boosted by the return of Yves Bissouma after his Africa Cup of Nations exit with Mali, alongside a potential comeback for Giovani Lo Celso from a thigh injury. Postecoglou confirmed on Friday that Manor Solomon and Ryan Sessegnon are the only definite absentees. As for Saturday’s visitors, Brighton responded to a 4-0 humiliation against Luton Town with a 4-1 demolition of rivals Crystal Palace on MD 23 at the Amex Stadium. Lewis Dunk, Jack Hinshelwood, Facundo Buonanotte and João Pedro were all on target. That convincing victory lifted Brighton to eighth in the league table – some nine points behind Spurs – after the Seagulls had two teenagers (Hinshelwood and Buonanotte) score in a single Premier League game for a second time (also Evan Ferguson and Julio Enciso against Bournemouth in April 2023). In contrast to the vibrant youth on offer for De Zerbi, Dunk also remains an ever-reliant figure at both ends of the pitch, having headed in Pascal Groß’s set-piece delivery for the third-minute opener against Palace. Since Brighton’s first Premier League campaign in 2017-18, only two defenders have scored more goals in the competition than Dunk’s 15 (Marcos Alonso, 19 and Virgil van Dijk, 17), while five of his last seven goals in top-flight football have been assisted by Groß.  De Zerbi is going to miss the game as he needs to have dental surgery, so assistant manager Andrea Maldera will take charge of the team. He will be without João Pedro who has picked up a hamstring injury, and also remains without Solly March, James Milner, Enciso and Joël Veltman, who are all injured. Simon Adingra remains at the AFCON with Ivory Coast, but Kaoru Mitoma has travelled with the team after he returned from the Asian Cup following Japan’s elimination. Tottenham have won six of their last seven home league games against Brighton, with the exception being a 1-0 loss in April 2022 as Leandro Trossard – now of Arsenal – scored a 90th-minute winner. However, Brighton were 4-2 winners in the reverse fixture in December as João Pedro (2), Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupiñán were all on target before late strikes from Alejo Véliz and Ben Davies gave the score some respectability for the visitors.  That tees this fixture up nicely for the Seagulls, who are looking to win back-to-back league meetings with Spurs for the very first time. Brighton may be unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League home games (W5 D5) but they have won just one of their last nine on the road in the competition (D3 L5), conceding 21 goals across these nine matches. They had started the season with two away wins against Wolves and Manchester United. Tottenham are at the opposite end of the scale, having lost just one of their last eight (W5 D2) – the 4-2 reverse against Brighton – following a woeful run of four defeats in five Premier League games from the start of November (D1). Postecoglou has Spurs at their free-scoring best, too, managing a goal in each of their last 35 Premier League games (73 goals total) since a 1-0 defeat to Wolves in March 2023. Finding the net in this match will make this the joint-second-longest scoring streak by a side in the competition’s history (36, level with Liverpool from Mar 2019-Feb 2020 and Manchester United from Dec 2007-Nov 2008), and would be behind only Arsenal’s run of 55 from May 2001 to November 2002. Spurs have also scored at least twice in their last eight Premier League games, only having a longer run between September and December 2011 (11). Yet, they’ve conceded twice in each of their last three as well, with West Ham in April 2021 the last team to score and concede 2+ goals in four consecutive Premier League matches. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer predicts Tottenham winning on Saturday as the hosts triumph in 49.7% of 10,000 pre-match simulations, compared to an away victory for Brighton in 23.7%. A draw appears more likely than the Seagulls succeeding, with that result forecast in 26.6% of the data-led scenarios, though that would do little to aid Spurs’ top-four push.  Tottenham’s most likely finish in Opta’s end-of-season simulations remains fifth – their current position – at 40.6%, with Spurs securing a top-four place in 40.1% of scenarios. Meanwhile, Brighton are backed to move a place up the league table to seventh 19.7% of the time. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to the game with our Manchester City vs Everton prediction and preview. While Arsenal emerged as one of the major winners from Matchday 23, beating Liverpool to breathe new life into their Premier League title hopes, the same could be said of Manchester City. The champions’ 3-1 win over Brentford took them within two points of the league-leading Reds with a game in hand, and Saturday’s early kick-off against Everton offers them the chance to return to the summit for the first time since November, at least for a couple of hours. Pep Guardiola’s side took full advantage of Liverpool’s first league defeat since September, recovering from a goal down to leave west London with three points on Monday. That victory saw the Opta supercomputer calculate City’s title hopes at 66.2% – their highest projected chance in roughly two months. Monday’s game provided the latest example of City refusing to know when they’re beaten, with only Liverpool (19) gaining more points from losing positions in the Premier League than their 17 this season. City have only bettered that tally in one previous campaign, recovering 20 points in 1993-94. Neal Maupay put Brentford ahead against the run of play midway through the first half, but Phil Foden punished Ethan Pinnock’s error to equalise on the stroke of half-time before completing his second Premier League hat-trick after the break. That made him the fifth player to score multiple trebles in the competition for City, after Sergio Agüero (12), Raheem Sterling, Erling Haaland (both five) and Carlos Tevez (four). Foden has been in inspired form since moving into a central position, recording eight goal involvements in his last six Premier League games (four goals, four assists). The omens are good for the England man ahead of Saturday’s game, too; he has scored four Premier League goals against Everton, only netting more against Brighton and Hove Albion (six) and Brentford (five). His second goal on Monday – a well-taken glancing header – was assisted by midfield partner Kevin De Bruyne, who has wasted no time in getting back up to speed after his five-month injury lay-off. The Belgian has been involved in 11 goals in his last 11 league games (four goals, seven assists) in a run stretching back to last April, while Monday’s assist was his 150th for City in all competitions. City appear to be clicking into gear even earlier than usual this season, and worryingly for their rivals, Guardiola has a fully fit squad to choose from. John Stones returned from injury against Burnley on MD 22, while fellow defender Manuel Akanji was an unused substitute at Brentford. Everton produced their own fightback last time out, recovering from 1-0 and 2-1 down in an entertaining 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham, with Jarrad Branthwaite’s 94th-minute header clinching a deserved point for the Toffees. While that result could prove pivotal in Everton’s battle to avoid relegation, they are now winless in six Premier League matches, drawing three in a row after losing their previous three. They last drew four successive league games between August and September 2022 under Frank Lampard. With Luton Town showing a remarkable improvement in recent weeks, the Everton’s fate could yet hinge on the outcome of their appeal against the 10-point deduction they received for breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules. Jack Harrison – who was contracted to City between 2018 and 2021 without making an appearance – was also on target against Spurs, and he could have a key role to play if Everton are to survive. Harrison scored in December’s reverse fixture against City as Sean Dyche’s men were beaten 3-1 at Goodison Park, and he could become the first Everton player to net home and away against them in a single Premier League season since Romelu Lukaku in 2016-17. Both of Everton’s goals against Spurs came from set-pieces, and if they are to have any chance of upsetting the treble winners, they’ll likely need to make the most of those chances again. Dyche’s team have scored 50% of their Premier League goals (13/26) from dead-ball scenarios this season, the highest proportion of any team in the division (excluding penalties). They’ve also recorded 110 shots from set-piece situations this campaign, a tally only bettered by Liverpool (111).  Everton’s midfield has been ravaged by selection issues in recent weeks, but Idrissa Gueye impressed on his return from international duty against Tottenham, while Dyche will hope Amadou Onana and Abdoulaye Doucouré can travel to the Etihad Stadium after recovering from their respective injuries. City are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League games against Everton, winning 11 and drawing two since suffering a 4-0 loss at Goodison Park in January 2017, during Guardiola’s first season at the helm. The champions fell behind in the reverse fixture in late December, but Foden equalised before a debateable Julián Álvarez penalty put them ahead. Bernardo Silva then completed the scoring by lobbing Jordan Pickford four minutes from time. Everton are also winless in their last 12 Premier League visits to the Etihad Stadium (five draws, seven defeats), having previously won on four straight trips there between 2008 and 2010. The Toffees enter MD 24 18th in the Premier League and City are unbeaten in their last 23 league games against teams inside the relegation zone, winning 21 and drawing two such matches since a 3-2 defeat at Norwich City in September 2019. City’s last such defeat this far into a season came in March 2015, against a Burnley side managed by Dyche. Can he mastermind another upset on Saturday? City have made the Etihad a fortress recently, only losing one of their last 35 home Premier League matches (29 wins, five draws). That defeat came against Brentford (2-1) in November 2022, and City are unbeaten in 21 home league matches since then (17 wins, four draws). Furthermore, City’s last four league defeats at the Etihad have come against London clubs – the last team from outside the capital to beat them on their own turf was Leeds United in April 2021. Everton, however, have been good travellers this term. Ignoring their 10-point deduction, only five Premier League teams have bettered their total of 17 points won on the road in 2023-24 (five wins, two draws, four defeats).  However, they are winless in four away games across all competitions (two draws, two defeats), after winning four in a row on their travels between late October and mid-December. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. City seem to be hitting their stride at the perfect time, and the Opta supercomputer does not foresee an end to their ominous run on Saturday. Guardiola’s men are chasing a 10th straight win across all competitions, and they emerge victorious in 74.3% of the supercomputer’s pre-match simulations. That is the largest win probability assigned to any Premier League team on MD 24. Everton are given just an 8.2% chance of a surprise win, with the likelihood of a draw rated at 17.5%. In the latest update to the supercomputer’s season predictions, Everton’s chances of relegation crept up from 21.5% to 22%.  Sheffield United (99.6%) and Burnley (96.4%) are seen as near-certainties to return to the Championship, while Luton (32.6%) and Nottingham Forest (30.6%) are also viewed as more likely to suffer the drop than Everton.

We look at the data from across the English top flight so far. In the summer of 2023, the Premier League, EFL, the FA and PGMOL met to discuss implementing new guidelines to apply to the following season of English football. Two of the key outcomes were a commitment to clamping down on dissent and punishing time-wasting. There had been a record number of cards for dissent in 2022-23 and the 2022 World Cup had caused a big debate about the amount of added time, factors that played into these decisions. We produced a widely-shared article on the amount of time the ball was in play in Premier League games and the remarkable insights showed why the governing bodies were keen to change the way added time would be calculated. Harsher punishments for dissent and time-wasting were meant to act as a deterrent for players and it was felt a lower threshold of tolerance would soon see players adapt and adjust their behaviour. However, it doesn’t seem to have worked. This season has already seen a record number of cards for both dissent and time-wasting and that has contributed to a more than 20% increase on both last season’s number of cards per game and the increase is so dramatic that 2023-24 currently has the highest average of cards per game in a single season in top-flight history. In fact, there have been more yellow cards for dissent and time-wasting this season than in any previous Premier League campaign, already surpassing 2022-23’s full-season totals. Referees’ chief Howard Webb has already said “We have to change mindsets. We will stick to this. We are not going to ease off. This will be here for good.” But it seems that harsher punishments are yet to elicit the desired impact in terms of reducing either offence. Perhaps punishment has come in another form. The amount of time added on has increased from seven minutes and 12 seconds on average last season to 10 minutes and nine seconds this season and the number of goals in added time in 2023-24 already stands at 67 which surpasses last season’s entire total of 49. But the authorities will be disappointed that the number of offences is not coming down as hoped. Perhaps that’s why there are rumours of experimenting with sin bins and blue cards… The 2022-23 campaign saw a marked reduction in the number of dismissals, meaning that the total of 30 shown across the whole campaign was the lowest in any season since 1993-94. 1993-94 to 1994-95 saw a big jump in the number of red cards in the top flight. The former had 28 while the next season leapt to 67 dismissals. The next decade had an average of 64 red cards per season, 2004-05 to 2013-14 saw that average drop slightly to 62 per season. After 71 dismissals in 2014-15, we’ve seen another substantial reduction with an average of 42 per season culminating in that record low for a 38-game campaign of just 30 in 2022-23. This reduction was generally viewed as a good thing, as supporters don’t want to see games affected by one side being reduced to 10 men so often. However, 2023-24 has seen a remarkable uplift in the number of red cards being dished out. Picking up ‘cheap’ yellows for dissent or time-wasting has contributed to this uplift. There have been 43 dismissals already and we are only 60% of the way through the season. This campaign is set to be one of the most prolific in terms of players sent off in the history of English football and if it carries on at around this rate, there is a good chance that a new record for dismissals might be set. So, which Premier League teams are the worst offenders at talking back to the referee? Leading the way on dissent this season are Chelsea with 22 players carded so far. Last season they earned 12, so have almost doubled their tally despite having only played 23 games in 2023-24. The Blues’ numbers are being boosted by Nicolas Jackson, who has picked up a remarkable seven yellow cards for dissent already this season. Enzo Fernández is in joint second with five, so the pair account for more than half of Chelsea’s bookings for dissent this season. Luton Town are the ‘gentlemen’ of the division with just three players being carded thus far for showing dissent. Chelsea – 22Manchester United – 18Brighton and Hove Albion – 16Fulham – 16Newcastle United – 15Wolverhampton Wanderers – 15Tottenham Hotspur – 13Bournemouth – 12Nottingham Forest – 12Sheffield United – 12Aston Villa – 11Manchester City – 11West Ham United – 11Crystal Palace – 10Everton – 9Liverpool – 9Brentford – 8Arsenal – 5Burnley – 5Luton Town – 3 In 2022-23, Aston Villa were the team punished most often for time-wasting. They picked up 19 cards for the offence, which was far more than the second worst team Fulham on nine. Chief culprit was goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, who was booked six times for time-wasting. The Argentina international has two more yellow cards this season and Villa are joint-top of this particular league of shame with 11 cards for time-wasting already this season, alongside Chelsea and Wolves. Aston Villa – 11Chelsea – 11Wolverhampton Wanderers – 11Liverpool – 8Sheffield United – 8Luton Town – 7Arsenal – 6Brighton and Hove Albion – 6Burnley – 6Manchester United – 6Tottenham Hotspur – 6Bournemouth – 5Brentford – 5Fulham – 5Everton – 4Nottingham Forest – 4Crystal Palace – 3Manchester City – 3Newcastle United – 3West Ham United – 3 Martínez trails the 2023-24 worst offender, Everton midfielder Amadou Onana, who has four cards for time-wasting. Proportionally though, it’s Liverpool who most likely to see a player shown a card for time-wasting. So far this season, 19% of all the yellow cards they have picked up have been for time-wasting, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Darwin Núñez being punished three times each so far. Enjoy this?

We preview the encounter, featuring our Jordan vs Qatar prediction via the Opta supercomputer. The 2023 AFC Asian Cup final will take place this Saturday, with host nation Qatar looking to seal back-to-back titles following their previous success in 2019. Standing in their way are tournament underdogs Jordan, who will play in their first Asian Cup final after never previously making it past the quarter-final stage of the tournament. Under the astute guidance of coach Hussein Ammouta, Jordan have surged to the final of the Asian Cup with a blend of resilience and determination. Their campaign kicked off with a resounding 4-0 victory against Malaysia in the group stage, setting the tone for their tournament aspirations. A hard-fought 2-2 draw against powerhouse South Korea showcased Jordan’s ability to compete at this level, however a narrow 1-0 loss to Bahrain in their final group match served as a minor setback. Undeterred, Jordan rallied in the knockout stages. Their last-16 clash was arguably one of the most dramatic seen at the tournament as they won 3-2 against Iraq in normal time, despite trailing as late as the 94th minute. With Iraq down to 10 men, Jordan capitalised with an equaliser from Yazan Al-Arab in the 95th minute and a winner shortly after from Nizar Al-Rashdan. In the quarter-finals, Jordan displayed grit and composure to edge past Tajikistan with a narrow 1-0 victory to set up a semi-final clash with South Korea – their second meeting in the tournament after the entertaining 2-2 group stage clash. In a stunning upset, Jordan emerged triumphant with a commanding 2-0 win thanks to second-half goals from Yazan Al-Naimat and Musa Al-Taamari, proving their mettle on the grand stage. With a blend of attacking prowess and defensive solidity, Jordan have defied expectations and marched into the final of this tournament. Under the leadership of coach Ammouta, they will look to capitalise on their momentum and clinch the coveted title in a historic showdown. Jordan in possession often look like a 4-2-4 with the two centre-midfielders Raja’ei Ayed and Al-Rashdan taking up central positions to assist the back-four build and protect them in any transition moments.\\xa0 Much of their play seems asymmetrical in that they build play down the left side of the pitch to open up space for Al-Taamari on the right.\\xa0This enables him to move higher and wider further up the pitch, becoming a key outlet for diagonal balls that allow him to engage in 1v1s with the opposition’s left-back. Qatar’s remarkable journey in the AFC Asian Cup has seen them progress to the final with an impressive display of skill and resilience. Under the stewardship of coach Tintín Márquez, who took charge just a month before the tournament, Qatar have ridden the wave of home expectations and are on the verge of retaining the Asian Cup – the last nation to do that were Japan in 2004. Their group stage dominance was evident as they topped their section without conceding a single goal. Victories against Lebanon (3-0), Tajikistan (1-0), and China (1-0) set the tone for their campaign, while in the knockout stages, they continued their winning streak with a 2-1 triumph over Palestine in the round of 16. A tense quarter-final encounter against Uzbekistan saw Qatar emerge victorious on penalties after a 1-1 draw, setting up a showdown with Iran in the semi-finals. In a thrilling match, Qatar secured a hard-fought 3-2 win, showcasing their character and spirit. Despite facing tough opposition, Qatar maintained their composure, with Akram Afif leading the charge with his early goal and instrumental contribution to the team’s attacking prowess. In an encounter that saw over 13 minutes of added time in the second half, Qatar weathered the storm and held on for victory, booking their spot in the final for the second consecutive tournament. With a chance to become back-to-back champions, Qatar will look to seize the moment and etch their names in Asian Cup history. In the semi-final against Iran, Qatar started in a 4-4-2 out of possession and seemingly a 4-2-3-1 in possession, with Akram Afif roaming behind the striker.\\xa0This was quite different from their usual 3-5-2 shape in previous matches and possibly used to match up man for man against the Iranians.\\xa0Later in the semi-final, the Qatari’s switched back to their usual 5-3-2 to increase their defensive solidity. Both Qatar’s Afif and Jordan’s Al-Taamari have evolved into key players for their respective sides between the 2019 edition of the Asian Cup and now. The Qatari forward has contributed to 19 goals in 13 AFC Asian Cup matches (six goals and 13 assists), averaging a goal or an assist every 60 minutes, while also having created 41 chances for teammates. Afif tops the charts for both of those metrics since the 2007 edition, when Opta started collecting this data. Both players are threatening when running with the ball at their feet. No player has attempted more shots following a ball carry at this tournament than Afif (5), while Al-Taamari has created the most chances following a carry (8). The Jordan winger has 32 take-ons at these finals, too – that tally is only bettered by South Korea star Lee Kang-in (34).\\xa0Overall, Al-Taamari has made seven goal contributions in the AFC Asian Cup (four goals and three assists), the most by any Jordanian player in tournament history. Afif’s goals have been crucial in Qatar’s journey to this final, with five scored at the tournament. Another goal will draw him level with Iraq’s Aymen Hussein at the top of the 2023 chart, with the possibility of a Qatari player winning the tournament top scorer award for a second edition in a row following Almoez Ali’s nine goals in 2019. This will be the first ever fixture between Jordan and Qatar in the AFC Asian Cup. They have already met in an international in 2024, though, with Jordan beating Qatar 2-1 in a pre-tournament friendly. Al-Naimat and an Ali Olwan penalty helped them come from behind after Afif had given Qatar the lead from the spot early in the game. Overall, Jordan have lost just one of their last five internationals against Qatar (W2 D2). This is just the third AFC Asian Cup final where both teams are Arab, with the previous two instances being Iraq v Saudi Arabia in 2007 and Saudi Arabia v United Arab Emirates in 1996. The Opta supercomputer gives host nation Qatar the advantage in this AFC Asian Cup final match, with the Qataris the more likely side to win the match inside 90 minutes. Ahead of kick-off, they won 38.4% of simulations without needing extra time compared to Jordan’s win rate of 34.8% – a very close call. Across those 10,000 simulations, over a quarter (26.8%) went to extra time with the scores level after the 90 minutes were up.

Pep Guardiola has been key to his development – in limiting his game time as much as making him a crucial part of Manchester City’s success. For most of Phil Foden’s career, there have been calls for him to play more football than he was getting at the time. When he first broke through midway through the 2017-18 season, he was so clearly such a huge talent that excited Manchester City and England fans quickly started demanding he be sent out on loan. The general consensus was that he needed to be playing regular first-team football. And lots of it. But City resisted doing so and risked harming the development of a player Pep Guardiola would in 2019 go on to describe as “the most talented I have ever seen.” This was City’s greatest ever academy product, and his game time was purposefully being limited. Across his first three seasons in the senior squad, he started just 12 Premier League matches when he would have been more than capable of playing for a mid-table team where he could easily have been a regular starter. In the next three seasons, he would start 63 Premier League matches – an average of 21 per season – for one of the best teams in the world under one of the best managers, playing 5,591 of a possible 10,260 minutes in the Premier League (54.4%). It wasn’t an insignificant amount of football, but it also wasn’t too much. There is a curious side to these numbers, though. For the last three seasons, Foden has started around half of City’s Premier League games despite simultaneously seemingly becoming a vital member of the first team. In the 2020-21 run to the Champions League final, for example, he started 12 of their 13 matches and played at least 80 minutes in all seven knockout-stage games. Only goalkeeper Ederson (1,080) played more minutes in the Champions League for City than Foden (1,066) in that campaign. So, while Foden was playing almost every minute as City chased the one trophy that meant more to them than any other – proving that injuries weren’t a problem for him that season – he was only on the field for 1,614 of a possible 3,420 minutes (47.2%) in the Premier League. Twelve teammates played more than him in the league. Even last season, despite being City’s second-highest scorer in the league (11) behind Erling Haaland (36), Foden played just 1,844 minutes – the 14th most in the City squad. There has clearly been a concerted effort to manage his game time for years. And Man City might just be reaping the benefits. Monday night brought a Foden hat-trick in the 3-1 comeback win at Brentford. He started on the left flank but with instructions to get on the ball centrally. Foden himself believes how he is playing now is up there with the best football he’s ever played. “I’m delighted with how I’m playing at the moment. I’m playing more inside where I want to be,” he said afterwards. “It’s probably the best form I’ve had in a City shirt for a long time, consistently. Long may that continue.” Consistency has certainly helped. Having started the last 11 Premier League games, Foden is on his joint-longest streak of league starts for City. A start against Everton next weekend would make this his outright longest. He also isn’t being rested much in other competitions, either. He has started City’s last 10 games in all competitions, making this his second-longest run in a City shirt, behind a 12-game stretch that ended in March 2022. Those two stretches are the only occasions he has ever started more than seven City games in a row. Previously, he had been given frequent rests. So, has there been a change of tack on Guardiola’s part? Is he finally willing to make Foden a fixture in his first-team plans? Obviously Foden is becoming a better player, which will help his chances of starting for City. And City have also had a few problems with injuries in attack of late, with Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Jérémy Doku all missing for significant periods. But even with them back, Foden has kept his place. Guardiola now sees him as indispensable to the team. There have been too many examples over the years of talented youngsters playing too much football at too young an age, who have later seen their career fizzle out too early. Foden has 8,628 Premier League minutes so far, still three months off his 24th birthday. By the point of turning 24, Wayne Rooney had played 17,349 minutes in the competition, Dele Alli had played 12,087; Joe Cole 13,711; Michael Owen 15,243; Robbie Fowler 15,671, and Romelu Lukaku 13,989. There are also plenty of examples of players being given lots of game time when young but continuing at the top level well into their 30s. And there’s also clearly more to each of these players’ stories than simply being overplayed in their formative years, but there is also every chance that Guardiola has taken action to avoid anything similar happening to Foden. According to Transfermarkt, Foden has suffered only two injuries in his seven seasons at the top level, missing a total of 89 days and 19 games for club and country. No two players are the same, but a look at the many injuries suffered by 21-year-old Pedri at Barcelona provides a cautionary tale.  Pedri became a first-team fixture as soon as he broke onto the scene in Spain, and he has been plagued by injury problems. Hamstring injuries alone have caused Pedri to miss 307 days and 55 games – both far more than Foden’s total absences and he is two and a half years younger than the Englishman. If it weren’t for all those injuries, Pedri would have played far more football than Foden in three seasons fewer than him. City have still got a lot from Foden. Despite playing relatively little football for someone so good, he ranks 17th in the Premier League era for goal involvements by players before they turn 24, with 68 (43 goals, 25 assists). And he’s got the rest of this season to add to his tally, with his 24th birthday not until late May. The downside to playing the kind of bit-part role that Foden has over the years is that he has played in lots of different positions, and it isn’t entirely clear what his best position is. He has played across midfield, up front, and even at left-back for City, and his position has also chopped and changed a remarkable amount even this season. It’s one element of Foden’s development that can’t have been easy for him to deal with. “It would help if I played one position and learned that position every game but I’m a person who adapts and plays where needed,” Foden said after the Brentford win. “I’m enjoying playing anywhere in the middle. That’s where I see myself. Hopefully I can play more in the middle.” Foden can no longer be considered a prospect for the future. He is an elite player for the here and now at City, and he will be key to his team’s chance of winning a fourth successive top-tier title – something that has never been done before. He has had a unique footballing education in part because he has spent his career learning almost entirely from one of the greatest managers of all time, but also because his game time has been managed so meticulously. City could reap the benefits for a long, long time to come. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to the game with our Bayer Leverkusen vs Bayern Munich prediction and preview. In what is undoubtedly the clash of the weekend across Europe, Bayer Leverkusen look to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga table to five points with a win over second-place Bayern Munich. That, of course, is easier said than done against the giants of German club football who have won 11 successive Bundesliga titles. But this Bayer Leverkusen side seem unlike any opponent Bayern have come up against in those 11 years, with Xabi Alonso turning them into genuine title contenders since arriving at the club as head coach in October 2022. Leverkusen are chasing their maiden Bundesliga title and aiming to become the 13th different club to win the competition since it began in 1963-64. They’ve come close before, finishing second place in five different seasons, but this could be their best chance yet. Leverkusen have conceded the fewest goals – their 14 after 20 games equalled a club record set in 1989-90 – and kept a league-high 10 clean sheets, and they only trail Bayern (59) for goals scored (52). Their high-intensity pressing game has seen four of their goals come following a high turnover, with Alonso’s men having a league-high 42 shots following such situations – 12 more than Bayern. Bayern are the giants of German football, having won a record 32 Bundesliga titles and the third-most European Cup/Champions League crowns (six) of any side. Not since 2011-12 have a side other than Bayern lifted the Bundesliga trophy, when Jürgen Klopp helped Borussia Dortmund to glory. Thomas Tuchel won the Bundesliga for the first time last season after taking charge at the club, to add to his two Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint-Germain in 2019 and 2020. Both Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich have been easy on the eye in the German top flight this season, with these two clubs being deemed the most ‘slow and intricate’ in style in the Bundesliga (below). Only two clubs have averaged 60% possession or higher in the competition this season – Leverkusen lead the way with 62.6% and Bayern follow just behind on 61.6%. It won’t come as much of a shock to learn Bayern Munich have inflicted more defeats on Bayer Leverkusen than any other team in the history of the competition (52), while Leverkusen have averaged fewer points against Bayern than any other opponent (0.84 – based on three points for a win). Their recent record against Bayern has been better, however. They are unbeaten in their last two meetings with the record champions following a 2-1 home win last season and a 2-2 draw in Munich earlier this term. The last time they went three league games unbeaten against Bayern Munich came between 2009 and 2010. The 2-2 draw on 15 September saw Bayer Leverkusen come from behind twice – firstly via Álex Grimaldo after Harry Kane had put Bayern ahead, and again in added time via Exequiel Palacios’ penalty after Bayern thought they’d sealed all three points through Leon Goretzka’s 86th-minute strike. This remains the only match that Bayern Munich have dropped points from a winning position in the league this season. Alonso’s side also went into that game top of the table, one of four occasions in Bundesliga history they have faced the second-placed side as league leaders – they haven’t won any of those (D2 L2). This weekend will be the fifth time. Alonso played 117 matches for Bayern as a player between 2014-2017. As a coach, he’s unbeaten in his first two Bundesliga games against them (W1 D1); the last manager to go unbeaten in his first three league games against Bayern was Julian Nagelsmann between 2016 and 2017 with TSG Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich have lost just one of their last eight Bundesliga encounters with Bayer Leverkusen (W5 D2), with that coming 2-1 at BayArena last season on 19 March 2023. Both of their goals that day also came via penalty kicks from Palacios in the second half, after Joshua Kimmich had given Bayern a 22nd-minute lead. Bayer Leverkusen are enjoying their best start to a season, with a phenomenal run of form. Following their midweek DFB-Pokal win over VfB Stuttgart, they are unbeaten in 30 consecutive matches in all competitions, which is not only a club record but two away from breaking the all-time record by a German professional club. That record is currently held by Bayern Munich, who went 32 games without defeat from December 2019 to September 2020, so this weekend brings them the chance to preserve that record for a while longer. Bayer Leverkusen’s record of 16 wins and four draws this season means they are just the fourth team in Bundesliga history to remain unbeaten 20 matches into a campaign, after Bayern in 1988-89, themselves in 2009-10 and Bayern again in 2013-14. Bayern hold the record for the longest unbeaten start to a Bundesliga season when they didn’t lose until their 29th match of 2013-14 en route to the title. Alonso’s side need just five more wins across their final 14 Bundesliga matches to equal their record tally of victories in a season, 21 set in 1996-97, 1999-00 and 2001-02 – all campaigns in which they finished second place. Bayern last suffered defeat on 21 January, losing 1-0 at home to Werder Bremen. They have recovered well since, winning their last three games, all in the Bundesliga and coming against current bottom-half sides Union Berlin, Augsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach. Their 50-point tally from 20 games is more than they had accumulated at the same stage in any of the last five seasons and seven more than this point last term (43). The last time that they won 50 points from their first 20 games was in 2017-18. Unbelievably still only 20 years old, Bayer Leverkusen’s Florian Wirtz is having a brilliant season. Now only three appearances away from making his 100th in the Bundesliga, Wirtz would become just the sixth player to reach a century of Bundesliga games before his 21st birthday – and that’s despite spending nearly a year out with an ACL injury between March 2022 and January 2023. Still three months away from turning 21, Wirtz is already 16th for the most minutes played in Bundesliga history before turning 21 and looks set to break into the top five before his birthday (he only needs to play 548 more minutes to do so). Wirtz is leading the Bundesliga for open-play chances created (47) ahead of Leroy Sané (43), while only the Bayern winger (7.0) has a higher open-play expected assists (xA) total than Wirtz (6.2) in the German top flight this season. Across all competitions in 2023-24, he’s been involved in 23 goals in 28 appearances, with his 15 assists more than any other Bundesliga player. While Wirtz is not alone in being a creative force in this side – teammate Grimaldo has more league goals (7) and assists (9) than he does this season – the recent form of the youngster has helped soften the blow of losing top scorer Victor Boniface to injury last month. As one of the leading scorers in Premier League history, there was little doubt Kane would be able to transfer his goalscoring prowess across to the German top flight following his big summer move from Tottenham Hotspur to Bayern. But, if anything, his goalscoring feats have arguably exceeded expectations in his debut season at the club. After none of their players could get more than 14 goals and only three hit double-figures in the Bundesliga last season (Serge Gnabry -14, Jamal Musiala – 12, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting – 10), Bayern needed to find a goalscorer. The England captain has certainly delivered. He’s scored 24 league goals across the opening 20 matchdays of the Bundesliga season, a tally that only Robert Lewandowski (2020-21 at Bayern) has ever been able to replicate. He’s now six goals away from equalling the all-time Bundesliga record for goals by a player in their first season (Uwe Seeler – 30 goals in 1963-64), and he needs 17 goals in the remaining 14 matchdays this season to equal Lewandowski’s all-time record tally of 41 in 2020-21. With 28 goals in all competitions this campaign, he’s just two away from hitting the 30-mark within a single campaign for the sixth time and needs 13 more competitive goals between now and the end of 2023-24 to equal his all-time seasonal best tally of 41 at Spurs in 2017-18. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,500 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend at the BayArena, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer played out this match 10,000 times before kick-off and the most common result saw Bayern Munich pick up a crucial away win. Of the pre-match sims, Bayern won 39.7% of them, with Bayer Leverkusen winning 33.3% of the time and the sides sharing a point in 27% of simulations. Should Bayern win this match then it would see them overtake Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the Bundesliga table and lead by a single point. If that happens, the Opta supercomputer sees Bayern winning the title 73% of the time – up from their current projection of 53.3%. Perfectly displaying how huge this game could prove to be in the title race, the Opta supercomputer thinks a win for Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday evening would boost their chances of clinching a first Bundesliga title to 66% from their current projection of 46.6%. A draw wouldn’t be a terrible result for either side, as their chances of title success would hardly change from the pre-match numbers, but it would see Leverkusen keep their narrow one-point lead with 13 matchdays remaining, which provides extremely little margin for error in a race against a Bayern side that are on a run of 11 Bundesliga titles. Three of the five previous occasions Bayer Leverkusen have finished second in the Bundesliga have seen them confirmed as runners-up to Bayern Munich (1996-97, 1998-99 and 1999-00); a defeat in this match could see history repeat itself once more.

We delve into the numbers and ask, why? We are only just past halfway in 2023-24, and Tottenham have already set an unwanted record. With eight goals conceded in second-half stoppage time, Spurs have already let in more late goals in Ange Postecoglou’s first season in charge than they ever have before in a Premier League campaign. Jarrad Branthwaite’s last-gasp equaliser for Everton on Saturday means Tottenham have let in more goals in the 90th minute or later than any other team in the division. Three more 90th-minute concessions in their final 15 games of 2023-24 and they’ll equal the Premier League record, set by Burnley in 2018-19 (11). It’s not great for a team with genuine hopes of getting back into the Champions League. Only 12 teams have ever conceded as many as eight goals in second-half injury time in a Premier League campaign, and a look at the previous teams to do so might not paint a picture that Spurs fans want to see. Of the 11 teams other than Spurs in 2023-24 to concede eight or more 90th-minute goals, six were relegated, while five survived. However, not one of them finished higher than 14th. Two finished bottom, but generally, conceding late goals is the hallmark of a team that puts up a decent fight in the battle against relegation and more often than not loses that battle. This isn’t to say Tottenham are going to start sliding down the table, but simply that teams as high up the table as they are – and have aspirations of staying up there – don’t crumble late on under opposition pressure like Spurs have since Ange Postecoglou came in. That is what relegation-battling teams do. It’s worth noting that very few of Spurs’ late concessions have actually been costly. Branthwaite’s equaliser on Saturday and the two goals conceded late on away to Wolves are the only of those eight injury-time goals that have caused Spurs to drop points – costing them five points in total. Meanwhile, the four goals Spurs have scored in the 90th minute or later have all earned points. The two against Sheffield United turned a loss into a win (+3 points), Joël Matip’s own goal against Liverpool turned a draw into a win (+2 points), and Dejan Kulusevski’s equaliser at Manchester City turned a defeat into a draw (+1 point). That’s six points gained from four goals scored at the death, compared to five dropped from eight goals conceded. So, the obvious next question is: does it matter that Tottenham have conceded so many late goals? Clearly, letting in goals in any circumstance isn’t ideal. But doing so when you’re already 4-0 up at home to Newcastle or 5-1 up at Burnley is probably the best time there is to do it. Meanwhile, letting two more in when already 2-1 down with nine men left on the pitch against Chelsea isn’t exactly going to bring back fond memories, but you can’t read too much into those two late Nicolas Jackson strikes. There are some mitigating factors that are worth considering here. Firstly, games are lasting much longer thanks to the strict new rules on time-wasting and the extra added time we are seeing at the end of halves. So, more goals and more late goals are expected. Secondly, starting players are going to be more tired having played for longer, while clubs can also bring on more fresh players with five substitutions now allowed. But those rule changes have affected every team this season, and it’s only Spurs who have let in eight goals in second-half injury time. Also, we’re only in early February, and Spurs are already threatening the Premier League record for injury-time goals conceded. The increase in injury time can’t account for that alone. Spurs have, however, been playing against teams chasing a way back into the game more than their Premier League counterparts because they have started games so well since Postecoglou came in. Tottenham have scored the first goal in 17 different games this season – the joint most in the division alongside Arsenal. Only City have led in games for more time this season than Spurs. But Postecoglou’s side have also struggled to hold on to their leads. They have thrown away 18 points from 1-0 leads, the second-most in the top flight after Brentford’s 24. They haven’t been able to contend with the pressure that opponents put on them after going ahead. Spurs have won just 10 (59%) of the 17 games in which they have scored first; comparatively, Arsenal have won 14 (82%). Game management is clearly an issue, but this isn’t a problem limited to injury time. Postecoglou has been clear that he won’t compromise his tactics whatever is happening on the pitch. Spurs play a very, very high line that has lots of benefits, and they will always push forward in search of one more goal. They play such attacking football and have so much quality in attack that they often score, but they also too often leave themselves too open. Postecoglou clearly believes that the best way to see out a win is to make sure the ball – and all of his players – are as far away from their own goal as possible. The logic makes sense: if you lose the ball high up the pitch, the opposition have a long distance to travel if they are to threaten goal. But by chasing more goals, Spurs end up losing the ball too much. The best teams that play a possession-based game will see out significant periods of the game late on by simply keeping it. Spurs aren’t able to do that effectively enough to see out games. An 88th-minute Nathan Aké goal knocked Spurs out of the FA Cup last month, while in three of their last four home wins, Brentford, Burnley and Everton all missed big late chances to equalise. On each occasion, Spurs came away with a one-goal win that was very nearly a draw. It hasn’t felt the most convincing, nor has it felt entirely sustainable. Spurs are still very much a work in progress under Postecoglou, and while they are still in the hunt for Champions League football, their manager won’t be worrying too much about his side conceding late goals. But this is an area with plenty of room for improvement if Spurs are to bridge the gap to the Premier League’s top three this season or further down the line under the Australian. Will Postecoglou have to tweak his tactics after all? Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Young stars Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala are likely to be at the centre of the action, so we’ve taken a look at these two remarkable talents.  The biggest game in Europe this weekend undoubtedly takes place in Germany on Saturday when Bayer Leverkusen host Bayern Munich. Xabi Alonso’s revolution at Leverkusen has been quite something, still undefeated in 30 games in all competitions in the 2023-24 season and top of the Bundesliga by two points. Inevitably breathing down their necks are Thomas Tuchel’s Bayern, despite the incredible pace at which Leverkusen have been going. They have raised each other to new heights, collecting a total of 102 points so far between them in this season’s Bundesliga, a record in the history of the competition for the top two after 20 games. Central to the sensational levels of both have been a pair of 20-year-olds with the world at their feet. Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala are two of the brightest talents to come out of Germany in years. At a time when the national team has been struggling, Wirtz and Musiala have provided hope to the country that they can inspire a strong showing for the host nation at Euro 2024 this summer under Julian Nagelsmann. Before then, they have the small matter of going head-to-head at club level for one of the more fiercely contested Bundesliga titles in recent years. Wirtz was snapped up as a teenager by Leverkusen from FC Köln in January 2020, impressing quickly and making his first-team debut before the end of that season. He even scored against – funnily enough – Bayern Munich to become the Bundesliga’s youngest-ever goalscorer at 17 years and 34 days old (Borussia Dortmund’s Youssoufa Moukoko – 16y 28d – broke the record a few months later). Wirtz established himself in senior football quickly and made 38 appearances (31 starts) in all competitions in 2020-21, scoring eight goals and recording seven assists. Only Moussa Diaby (59) created more chances from open play for Leverkusen than Wirtz (56) that season. It was 10 goals and 14 assists in all competitions for Wirtz in 2021-22 from just 31 games (27 starts), and again, only Diaby created more open-play chances (68-65). Those numbers were made more impressive considering Wirtz’s season was over by the end of March. Sadly, he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against former club Köln that would keep him out until the following January. Some questioned whether Wirtz would be the same player when he returned, but those questions didn’t last long. Since his comeback against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 22 January 2023, Wirtz has played 53 games for Leverkusen (43 starts), scoring 12 goals and adding 23 assists – more assists than any player in Europe’s top five leagues in that time. Only Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes has created more open-play chances (143) and won possession more times in the final third (63) than Wirtz (118 and 60), while only Fernandes (43) and Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (31) have created more big chances than him (28). Wirtz has eight goals and 15 assists in all competitions this season. No player in Europe’s top five leagues has created as many open-play chances than his 64, while only Salah (19) has created more big chances than his 18.  His 15 assists are at least three more than any other player in Europe’s top five leagues, with two more coming in Tuesday’s DFB-Pokal quarter-final comeback win over Stuttgart. With Leverkusen 2-1 down, Wirtz produced a perfectly weighted through ball for substitute Amine Adli to race through and equalise, before his sublime cross to the back post for Jonathan Tah in the 90th minute allowed the centre-back to head in the winner. 15 – Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz assisted 15 competitive goals in 2023-24, the most by any player in Europe's five big leagues. Diamond. pic.twitter.com/XfP2nsLzNc Wirtz also has more attacking sequence involvements (148) than any other player in the Bundesliga this season, with a nice balance of 43 shots attempted, 46 chances created and 59 involvements in the build-up to a shot. He has attempted 18 through balls in the Bundesliga this season, with no other player trying more than 13, while his 62 layoffs are at least 12 more than the next-highest player. Only teammate Granit Xhaka (114) and Bochum’s Kevin Stöger (116) have made more progressive passes than Wirtz (111), notable because he generally plays a lot higher up the pitch than those players. He has also received the fourth-most passes in the Bundesliga (1,076) and has received the most progressive passes (150), showing that he works hard at both finding opportunities to create chances while also making himself available to others off the ball. Following Wirtz’s sensational solo goal against Freiburg in late October 2023 when he turned poor Nicolas Höfler inside and out, Alonso said of his star: “The things he does, I can’t teach him these things, just like today. There’s only a few players in the Bundesliga who can do this.” Wirtz is a bonafide wunderkind, as is one particular opponent on Saturday. Musiala has followed a similar path to Wirtz. He also didn’t come through the youth system at his current club, being signed by Bayern after he left Chelsea’s academy in 2019. 100 – Aged 20 years and 297 days, Jamal Musiala is the youngest Bayern player in Bundesliga history to reach 100 top-flight appearances and the fourth-youngest player overall in Bundesliga history after Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Julian Draxler. Bambi. #WOBFCB pic.twitter.com/9tMk5bWyYU He made his Bundesliga debut just a month after Wirtz and, much like the Leverkusen youngster, didn’t waste any time proving his credentials. His first goal for Bayern in an 8-0 thrashing of Schalke made him the club’s youngest scorer at 17y 205d.  Musiala made only 11 starts in the 2020-21 season in all competitions but made 37 appearances overall and managed seven goals and one assist. No other Bayern player could match his dribbles attempted (7.3) or dribbles completed (4.1) per 90. Unlike Wirtz, Musiala was eased into regular game time, following his 11 starts in 2020-21 with 18 in 2021-22 from a total of 40 appearances, contributing eight goals and five assists. Alphonso Davies and Kingsley Coman finished slightly ahead of him for dribbles attempted per 90, but his growing influence on the team was becoming clear, especially with his goal to seal a 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund that clinched Bayern’s 10th consecutive Bundesliga title. Musiala’s number of starts rocketed last year with 36 in total, and no other Bayern player made more than his 47 appearances in all competitions. He managed an impressive 29 goal involvements (16 goals, 13 assists) and was even more decisive come the season’s end, scoring the winning goal away at Köln on the last day of the season that snatched the title from Dortmund in the closing moments of the campaign. Of the seven players from Europe’s top five leagues to complete more dribbles than Musiala (113), only Jérémy Doku (6.5) and Vinícius Júnior (3.7) completed more per 90 than his 3.4, while he created at least 12 more chances from open play than any of his Bayern teammates in 2022-23. Musiala has seven goals and three assists so far this season in 23 games (19 starts) as he looks to help Bayern find success in both the league and Champions League. Only Leroy Sané (145), Dayot Upamecano (144) and Davies (143) have made more long progressive carries for Bayern (moving the ball forward more than 10 metres) than Musiala’s 91. As you can see below, he performs these carries all over the pitch too. He’s also been helping Harry Kane take to the Bundesliga like a goalscoring duck to water, and the England captain has been impressed by what he’s seen from Musiala. Kane told TNT Sports shortly after he moved to Munich from Tottenham last year: “Jamal has been fantastic. There’s been a lot of talk about how good he is and how young he is. He’s been great to watch in training and in tight areas how he moves and how he plays forwards. He’s been fantastic to play with so far.” Both Wirtz and Musiala will be 21 when the Euros come around this summer. With all eyes on Germany as hosts, they will be expected to produce. What better way to prepare for such a pressured situation than by going head-to-head in what promises to be a high-quality and tense title race? When Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich meet at the BayArena on Saturday, the stakes will be as high as the expectations. Despite Wirtz and Musiala’s formative years, don’t be surprised to see one or both rise to the occasion. Enjoy this?

A move to the Premier League is now on the cards in a transfer that should excite Manchester City fans. Sávio may not have arrived in Spain to any great fanfare – after all, he’d just come off a loan spell at PSV, where he managed only eight appearances across all competitions – but Girona coach Michel had a good feeling about the 19-year-old.\\xa0\\xa0 After the Brazilian’s hugely promising first six weeks or so in La Liga, which coincided with Girona’s best start ever to a top-flight campaign, Míchel made a radio appearance on El Larguero and provided a little more context to the arrival of their man of the moment.\\xa0 “The sporting management had been following Savinho since the last Under-20 World Cup,” he said. “We had an excellent image [of him], despite him having just come back from a season without enchanting at PSV; we had the feeling he could be the right player for us. I’ll say one big thing: since Vinícius Júnior’s arrival in Spain, I haven’t seen such a great one-on-one talent like Sávio.”\\xa0 For a country blessed with such technical talent, that was high praise indeed, and Sávio has continued to excel for a Girona side that is still pushing hard at the top of the table, long after many expected their early promise to fizzle.\\xa0 But of course, as occurs with virtually any team that comes out of the blue to threaten the status quo, Girona are likely to be picked apart by the vultures of European football. It’s seemingly already begun with Sávio, who has reportedly agreed a move to Manchester City for next season.\\xa0 Now to address the elephant in the room; yes, Sávio moving to City won’t be even remotely surprising if it happens. In fact, it was probably the plan all along considering he joined City Football Group club Girona on loan from City Football Group club Troyes, who could somehow afford to buy Sávio in the first place in a deal apparently worth up to €12.5 million before loaning him out less than three weeks later.\\xa0\\xa0 However, the questionable morality of this kind of club ownership model is a discussion for another time; Sávio’s hardly the one to blame here, rather he’s taken full advantage of the opportunity given to him at Girona and thrived, immediately becoming a key player and establishing himself as one of the most promising footballers in Spain.\\xa0 Whether he’ll end up staying with City next season or being loaned out remains to be seen, but Sávio’s impact in La Liga this term suggests he’s already capable of being a useful asset to Pep Guardiola in 2024-25 and beyond.\\xa0 A graceful, brave and exciting winger, Sávio shows the kind of adaptability that could really give him an edge over other wide players as he looks to carve out a career for himself at the very top. During his formative years, he was frequently used on the right in the mould of a modern inverted winger, cutting inside on to his stronger left foot. But at Girona, he’s switched flanks and it’s arguably brought out the very best in him.\\xa0 While he undoubtedly has the skillset to play on the right and come inside, Sávio’s one-on-one ability and tremendous crossing technique have made him such a potent weapon on the left and something of a throwback, terrorising many defences and goalkeepers with the chipped technique he favours for many of his deliveries into the danger zone. His style resembles more old-fashioned wingers as he’s tallied 15 open-play crosses following a one-on-one duel, four more than any other player in La Liga this season. Those were among his total of 79 open-play crosses, which is the seventh most in the division.\\xa0 Such a crossing frequency shouldn’t be misconstrued as him being one-dimensional or lacking subtlety, however. Sávio has brought real creative threat to Girona this season; not only is his 28 chances created in open play bettered by only nine players, but those have also led to a league-high seven open-play assists.\\xa0 What makes that even more impressive is the fact it matches up almost perfectly with his 7.02 open-play expected assists (xA), a model that rewards players who pass into dangerous areas and measures the likelihood of a pass becoming a goal assist. Sávio is well clear of his nearest rival, Ilkay Gündogan (5.16), in that metric, highlighting the danger he brings with his use of the ball. The main beneficiary to Sávio’s effective wing play is Girona’s first-choice centre-forward Artem Dovbyk, a very promising player in his own right. The Ukraine international is enjoying a phenomenal first season in La Liga after being signed from Dnipro-1 in the summer, with his 14 goals bettered by no one else.\\xa0 Sávio has laid on eight opportunities to Dovbyk in La Liga this term, with only four other wingers, wide midfielders and full-backs providing more chances to a given striker, and none of those have gone beyond nine. Among the same group of players, Sávio’s 2.25 xA for Dovbyk is comfortably the highest and they’ve linked up for a couple of goals.\\xa0\\xa0 It’s always helpful when your wide players form a good understanding with the main striker, and this relationship with Dovbyk could be seen as a promising sign for City fans; obviously no two players are exactly alike, but there are undoubtedly similarities in style between Dovbyk and Erling Haaland, with the Ukrainian’s statistical output this term rated as being more comparable to Haaland’s past four campaigns by the Opta Radar below.\\xa0\\xa0 But again, this relationship with the big man up top needn’t be perceived as some kind of cheap, dirty video game tactic. There are plenty of examples that highlight Sávio’s subtlety; he’s not simply a head-down-and-run type winger. He plays with deliberation, purpose, and with his head up.\\xa0\\xa0 There were two particularly notable examples in Girona’s 4-2 December win away to Barcelona. The first saw him take up possession just inside the left side of the hosts’ box and shape for a first-time cross, but his feint allowed space to open up in a central position for left-back Miguel Gutiérrez, who took a touch and shot agonisingly wide of the bottom-right corner.\\xa0\\xa0 Then, a little later in the second half, Sávio appeared to size up Jules Koundé and Frenkie de Jong, but instead of dropping the shoulder he got his head up and played an inch-perfect cross right between them into the path of Viktor Tsygankov, who prodded wide from about seven yards out.\\xa0 Another key feature of his game is darting runs onto through balls in behind the full-back. Such a move tore Sevilla open in the recent battering of Quique Sánchez Flores’ side, with Sávio luring Tanguy Nianzou out wide before bursting away from him in an instant to collect a pass and tee up Tsygankov for an easy finish.  There were similar instances against Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, the latter example coming from the right flank, both of which were let down by poor finishes from Dovbyk.\\xa0This is also evidence of the positivity and drive he can bring in attack, with only six players (minimum 900 minutes played, excluding centre-backs) making more than his 10.7 progressive carries per 90 minutes.\\xa0\\xa0 These progressive runs aren’t just limited to the very limits of the pitch, though. Sávio has a regular tendency to pick the ball in deep areas out wide and carry it diagonally infield towards the edge of the box, a feature you’d not tend to associate with wingers of the more throwback variety. It’s effective, though, as his chance-creating carries map highlights, and provides a glimpse of the adaptability mentioned earlier.\\xa0 He boasts the speed and ability on the ball to exploit spaces and destabilise defences if given opportunities to run at them, with the graphic below showing his run and pass before Tsygankov’s lovely goal against Granada in September.\\xa0\\xa0 The trade-off for him being such a reliable creative force on the left is that he doesn’t get many shots away himself. Registering 1.2 attempts on average per 90 minutes this season, Sávio is one of the least productive forwards in La Liga this term with respect to being the one trying to finish chances – that being said, he’s still managed to score five times, which is a solid return.\\xa0 A lack of shots may simply be an understandable consequence of being a predominantly left-footed player playing on the left wing, and it’s unclear if that’s where he’d be utilised should the move to City come to fruition. Given his impact at Girona, you’d have to say it would make sense, but Guardiola doesn’t really use wingers in that way, and he’s already got Jack Grealish and Jérémy Doku competing for one position on the left.\\xa0\\xa0 Perhaps Sávio will be the belated replacement for Riyad Mahrez and, to a lesser extent, Cole Palmer? Stranger things have happened, though it’s difficult to escape the feeling his threat might be dampened somewhat.\\xa0 Either way, City look to have acquired another fine and exciting young talent for their arsenal, and if any coach can shape Sávio into a world-class player, Guardiola’s the one.\\xa0\\xa0 It’s fair to say his next move is going to generate a little more buzz than his last.\\xa0\\xa0 Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the match at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan with our Ivory Coast vs DR Congo prediction and preview. Ivory Coast have reached the semi-finals of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, despite only winning one of their five matches inside 90 minutes. After a disappointing group stage, which included a record 4-0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea in their final group match, head coach Jean-Louis Gasset was sensationally sacked mid-tournament, despite Ivory Coast still having a chance of progressing to the knockout stage. As it turned out, their third-place finish in Group A was enough to secure a spot in the round of 16, so interim coach Emerse Faé has been in charge of their last two matches at the tournament. He’s overseen a penalty-shootout win over reigning champions Senegal in the last 16, followed by an excellent comeback win versus Mali in the quarter-finals. The Ivorians were heading out of the tournament until Simon Adingra’s injury-time equaliser took the tie to extra time, where Oumar Diakité’s last-gasp goal sealed progression to the semis in the most dramatic of circumstances. Unfortunately for Ivory Coast, match-winner Diakité will be missing for this tie after receiving a second yellow card and subsequent red for his goal celebrations in that win. DR Congo’s quarter-final win was less dramatic, defeating Guinea 3-1, although they did have to come from behind to seal their spot in the final four. Goals from Chancel Mbemba, Yoane Wissa (penalty) and Arthur Masuaku saw them reach the AFCON semis for the first time since 2015, when they eventually exited at this stage to the Ivorians. That win over Guinea in the quarter-final was their first win at AFCON 2023 after four successive draws. They drew against Morocco, Zambia and Tanzania in the group stage before drawing 1-1 with Egypt in the last 16, needing a penalty shootout to advance. Of the four semi-finalists at AFCON 2023, Ivory Coast are the only side to have averaged more possession than their opponents (56.2%), while they have scored the fewest goals (5) and conceded the same number as South Africa, Nigeria and DR Congo combined (7). DR Congo have been one of the hardest teams to break down at the tournament, allowing opponents just 35 shots with 11 of those on target in their five games – fewer than the other three semi-finalists. This will be the sixth time that Ivory Coast and DR Congo have met at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament. Four of the previous five meetings have been in the group stage, but they came up against one another in the 2015 semi-finals – a tie that Ivory Coast won 3-1 thanks to goals from Yaya Touré, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon which cancelled out a Dieumerci Mbokani first-half penalty. Ivory Coast went on to win the tournament following a penalty shootout against Ghana in the final – their second, and most recent AFCON title. DR Congo and Ivory Coast met again in the 2017 tournament, with the two nations playing out a 2-2 draw in the group stage. Ivory Coast went out in the groups that year, while DR Congo eventually exited in the quarter-finals. More recently, Ivory Coast enjoyed a 3-1 friendly win over DR Congo in October 2019 before they drew 0-0 in the group stage of the 2022 CAF African Nation Championship in January 2023. Host nation Ivory Coast are predicted as the most likely of these sides to progress to the final of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations by the Opta supercomputer. Across the 10,000 simulations before kick-off, Ivory Coast won inside 90 minutes 41.3% of the time compared to the DR Congo’s 32.3%. Across those pre-match sims, over a quarter (26.4%) saw the tie go to extra time – something Ivory Coast had to go through in order to reach this stage both against Senegal in the round of 16 (eventually winning after a penalty shootout) and Mali in the quarters. As it stands, Ivory Coast are the second favourites to win AFCON 2023 behind Nigeria. Before the tournament began, the hosts were also second favourites with the Opta supercomputer (12.1%) behind reigning champions Senegal (12.8%), while DR Congo were considered as outsiders at 2.4% – that projection was below 10 other teams.

We’re down to the last four in Ivory Coast, as Nigeria face South Africa at the Stade de la Paix in Bouaké on Wednesday. The last time South Africa featured in the AFCON semis they faced Nigeria in 2000, and they will be looking to avenge their 2-0 defeat from that tournament. Nigeria advanced to the final four with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Angola. Ademola Lookman scored the winner for the Super Eagles, making it three goals at AFCON 2023 for the Atalanta winger, joint-second at the tournament behind Angola’s Gelson Dala. Victor Osimhen remains on just one goal at AFCON 2023, though he was denied by an offside flag after appearing to double Nigeria’s lead against Angola on Friday. It’s not for a lack of trying, though. No player has had as many as Osimhen’s 19 total shots (including blocks) at the tournament. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the Napoli striker is underperforming his xG by a bigger margin than any other player (-2.09). He has a shot conversion rate of 5.3%, with an expected goals tally of 3.09. South Africa went through on penalties after an absorbing contest with Cape Verde. The game finished 0-0 in normal time, with Hugo Broos’ men winning 2-1 on penalties. Captain Ronwen Williams led by example to send his team to the semi-finals. The goalkeeper wasn’t called on much during normal and extra time, with Cape Verde hitting the target just twice from their 25 attempts, but Williams saved an incredible four of their five penalties in the shootout. Williams has had an impressive tournament overall and will surely be key again in this semi-final. He has conceded just two goals at AFCON 2023 from an expected goals on target (xGOT) conceded of 5.1, meaning he has conceded less than half the goals that would normally be expected. However, no other team at the tournament has racked up a higher expected goals (xG) total than Nigeria’s 8.59, so he will likely be kept busy. Nigeria and South Africa have played each other 12 times previously in all competitions, with seven wins for the Super Eagles and just one for Bafana Bafana. It will be the fourth game between Nigeria and South Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations, with the Super Eagles winning the previous three by an aggregate score of 8-1. As mentioned, that includes the last time South Africa appeared in the semi-finals of an AFCON tournament, with Nigeria beating them 2-0 in 2000. Their last meeting saw Nigeria defeat South Africa 2-1 in the quarter-finals of AFCON 2019, with William Troost-Ekong scoring an 89th-minute winner after Bongani Zungu had equalised Samuel Chukwueze’s opener. Nigeria are predicted to advance to the final with a win over South Africa in this AFCON semi-final tie. Across 10,000 pre-match simulations by the Opta supercomputer, Nigeria won the game inside 90 minutes 52.2% of the time, with Bafana Bafana winning less than a quarter of them (24.6%). There is a 23.2% chance of extra time and therefore possible penalties. Overall, as of writing, Nigeria have a 63.8% chance of going through, with South Africa handed a 36.2% possibility. Nigeria have been favourites to win AFCON 2023 since defending champions Senegal were eliminated in the last 16, while South Africa have gone from a 2.1% chance of lifting the trophy at the start of the tournament to third-favourites now of the remaining four teams.  Here are the up-to-date tournament projections for both Nigeria and South Africa by the Opta supercomputer: Nigeria: Olorunleke Ojo, Stanley Nwabali, Francis Uzoho, Kenneth Omeruo, William Troost-Ekong, Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Alhassan Yusuf, Raphael Onyedika, Joe Aribo, Frank Onyeka, Moses Simon, Paul Onuachu, Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, Terem Moffi, Ademola Lookman.

After defying virtually everyone’s expectations in earning promotion from the Championship last season, Luton Town’s first top-flight campaign in over 30 years looked likely to be long and harsh, particularly following back-to-back defeats in their two opening games. They were comfortably beaten 4-1 by Brighton and then 3-0 by Chelsea. Although not the most straightforward of opposition to begin a season against, many would’ve felt they were results that confirmed the gulf between Rob Edwards’ men and the Premier League. Another two losses followed, and despite the significant amount of time remaining, you’d have done well to find many neutrals not writing them off. It was shaping up to be a race to the bottom between them and their fellow promoted sides, Sheffield United and Burnley. But gradually, Luton showed signs of adaptation and positive results have rarely been far from their grasp, losing by more than one goal just twice in all competitions since that defeat at Stamford Bridge in August. It’s the past two months that seem to have transformed Luton’s season, though. They went into December with just two Premier League wins to show for their efforts, but since then have tallied three victories, pushed Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal close in slender defeats, and nearly beat Newcastle United at St James’ Park at the weekend. Saturday’s thrilling 4-4 draw with Newcastle came four days on from a stunning 4-0 hammering of Brighton. Not only was it a sweet act of revenge for earlier in the season, but it was also poignant in highlighting how far they’d come since the previous meeting, going from arguably the favourites for relegation to one of the Premier League’s form teams. Over their last six games, Luton have taken 11 points. That’s a figure only Liverpool, Wolves (both 13) and Manchester City (15 from five matches) can better over the same period, and one more than Arsenal and Manchester United. It’s a far cry from a run of one win in their first 12 league games this season. “I think we’ve had to grow, learn and change as the season’s gone on,” Edwards said after the thriller in Newcastle. “Not [changed] my principles or what we believe in, but just tactically we’ve been able to be a bit more aggressive because of the attributes the players have got.” This is arguably most notable in their pressing. Before December 1, Luton averaged 37.3 pressures – defined as a defending team’s player approaching the player in possession with the aim of winning the ball or limiting passing options – in the final third per game, which was the third lowest in the division. Since 1 December, however, they’ve recorded 60.4 pressures in the final third per game, third only to Everton (77.9) and Manchester City (62.8). It’s not like they’ve played lots of teams that sit back in that time, either, having faced Arsenal, Chelsea, City and Newcastle twice.  Furthermore, 28% of their total pressures since the start of December have occurred in the attacking third, as opposed to 19% beforehand, so not only are they generally working with greater intensity when attempting to win the ball back, there’s a concerted effort to focus that urgency higher up the pitch. A good example of how this has paid dividends is their first goal in the recent win over Brighton. Right from kick-off Luton were in the faces of their opponents and won the ball back within eight seconds; they swiftly turned that into the first attack of the game and scored through Elijah Adebayo 11 seconds later to set the tone for the match. Their attacking numbers have also improved considerably. Luton’s shot frequency hasn’t changed, remaining at 11.4 per game on average, but since the start of December they’ve managed 4.8 on target each match, a significant uptick from 2.7 before. Combine this with an increase in their expected goals (xG) output per game (0.96 pre-December, 1.27 since) and it paints a picture of a team that’s steadily become more attuned to the demands of the league and thus making smarter decisions in the final third. This is also reflected in how clinical they’ve been over the past two months, with no team scoring more “big chances” than their 14 – that’s from a possible 18, giving them a big-chance conversion rate (77.8%) that is far better than any other team in the league since 1 December. A key component of Luton’s chance creation has been their width and the abilities of their wide players, with no team using wing-backs as opposed to full-backs for a greater proportion of time than them this term (88%). While the rapid Chiedozie Ogbene – nominally a winger – appears to have made the right wing-back berth his own in recent weeks, Alfie Doughty has been a mainstay on the left and arguably Luton’s most-celebrated player this season. His deliveries, both in open play and at set-pieces, have been a regular feature, with Doughty’s 38 chances created 11 more than any other Luton player. Fourteen have come in open play, putting him behind only the reinvigorated Ross Barkley (21) and Ogbene (19). The mentality of Luton’s wide players is also a good example of the aggressive positivity Edwards spoke about at the weekend, with their wing-backs being the most advanced wide defenders in the league this season, as the graphic below highlights. Nevertheless, there has been something of a shift in the way Luton play. Before December, their 203 open-play crosses was the most in the Premier League; their 111 since is only more than seven teams, suggesting a greater degree of subtlety in how they attack. This has coincided with Barkley finding his feet, flourishing to an extent that talk of an England recall – having not played for his country since 2019 – is gaining traction. Although he was robbed of the ball in the build-up to Newcastle’s late equaliser at the weekend, the former Chelsea midfielder was otherwise excellent again; it was his free-kick that caused havoc for Luton’s first goal, he then scored their second having played a vital role in the build-up, and he set up Adebayo for number four. Over the past two months, he’s been involved in 47 shot-ending open-play sequences, one shy of double any other Luton player in that time and 27 more than from August until December, evidence of him gradually getting sharper following a largely underwhelming few years. Goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski also deserves praise for his reliability between the posts. According to Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) conceded model, Kaminski has let in 5.9 goals fewer than he’d be expected to based on the quality of shots faced, a better record than any other Premier League goalkeeper this term and evidence of some fine shot-stopping. However, quirks like that also highlight a degree of good fortune on Luton’s part. Not only have they needed their goalkeeper to perform way above the average, their finishing efficiency – as alluded to earlier – is out of the ordinary. Across the whole season, only three teams have had lower-quality non-penalty shots on average than Luton in the Premier League (Burnley, Sheffield United and Crystal Palace). Their xG per non-penalty shot is 0.096, which essentially means the average chance Luton create you’d expect to be converted 9.6% of the time. However, their shot conversion rate from these efforts is 11.7%; only Tottenham (+2.2%) and City (+2.5%) have converted non-penalty shots above their expected rate to a greater degree than Luton (+2.1%). This is obviously a good thing; there’s nothing bad about scoring. But, it’s also a warning that they could potentially just be on a hot streak, one that ultimately fizzles out before they can build a significant gulf between themselves and the relegation zone. Is Luton’s recent form just a flash in the pan, or is it a natural sign of progression, improvement and increased self-belief? That remains to be seen. Either way, Edwards will want to nip any signs of arrogance in the bud; sure, they’ve done brilliantly over the past six weeks or so to propel themselves out of the bottom three, accumulating 20 points from 22 games and giving themselves a fighting chance of retaining top-flight status, but they’re hardly bulletproof; 15 promoted teams have still gone on to be relegated back to the second tier from the Premier League after earning 20 points or more from their first 22 matches, six of whom had exactly 20. Establishing a team in the Premier League isn’t an easy one, particularly for the promoted clubs, and a long path remains ahead of Luton that doesn’t just end with the conclusion of 2023-24; after that comes the infamous threat of the so-called ‘second-season syndrome’ that’s claimed so many who’d previously promised much. Clearly, though, Edwards and Luton are giving it a better crack than most anticipated, with the weekend’s results bringing their relegation probability down to a season-low 32.6%, according to the Opta supercomputer. Fans should absolutely enjoy as much of it as they can, for as long they can. “The players deserve all the credit because they’re doing it in the hardest league there is,” Edwards said on Saturday. “It makes me really proud.” So he should be. Their improvement has been significant and has them set up to potentially confound a few more doubters before the season’s end. Enjoy this?

Is time running out for Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge? Boos rang out at Stamford Bridge when the full-time whistle blew on Sunday. Chelsea had been beaten 4-2 by Wolverhampton Wanderers, with Matheus Cunha scoring a hat-trick against very little resistance. Mauricio Pochettino could only look on from the dugout as, for the second time in less than a week, his team shipped four goals and lost in the Premier League. While reports suggest his job remains safe for now, it seems as though patience is starting to wear thin in some quarters with the former Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain boss. Even Belle Silva, wife of Thiago Silva, had her say on X during the closing stages of the Wolves defeat, posting: “It’s time to change. If you wait any longer it will be too late.” It’s time to change. If you wait any longer it will be too late 💙💙 Perhaps she was talking about substitutions, or simply relaying something she said to her husband when he was playing computer games as they were about to go out for dinner. The message seemed pretty clear, though. Pochettino has since said he and Thiago Silva have had a discussion and that their relationship is good, but it was another unwanted distraction in a disappointing campaign so far. Chelsea had a terrible 2022-23 season, with none of Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter and Frank Lampard able to turn things around before they ultimately finished 12th in the Premier League. Having spent roughly £270 million on new players in January 2023, they shelled out another reported £400m over the summer and hired the highly-rated Pochettino. Blues fans and even some in the media declared Chelsea to have ‘won the transfer window’ heading into the new campaign. After 23 games of the 2023-24 season, they sit in 11th place. When Potter arrived last season, the former Brighton boss had a tough task with coming in during the campaign. He was eventually sacked after seven wins and eight defeats from 22 Premier League games (D7) at 1.27 points per game. Pochettino, who had an entire pre-season to prepare his new team, has won nine and lost 10 of his 23 Premier League games so far (D4) at 1.35 points per game. After their back-to-back defeats to Liverpool and Wolves, Chelsea have conceded four or more goals in four different Premier League games this season, their most in a single league campaign since 1990-91 (also four). They have now conceded 4+ goals in consecutive league games twice under Pochettino; before he arrived Chelsea hadn’t shipped 4+ goals in consecutive games since December 1989. After their 2-1 defeat at Molineux in the reverse fixture with Wolves on Christmas Eve, Chelsea had started to look like they were beginning to improve. Three wins in a row followed in the league, as well as advancing to the EFL Cup final and the FA Cup fourth round, where they face a replay at Aston Villa on Wednesday. However, their humbling at Anfield was followed by an insipid surrender to Wolves on home soil that would have made the three little pigs shake their heads in despair. As mentioned, it was Chelsea’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season after 23 games. Only in the 1993-94 season (after 18 games) have they reached 10 defeats in fewer outings in the competition. So, what on earth is going on? There have been flashes of the potential that was supposed to come with spending so much money on young talent. The 4-1 win at Tottenham (aided by two red cards for Spurs in the first half), the spirited 4-4 draw with Manchester City, and the passage to the EFL Cup final with a 6-1 thrashing of Middlesbrough last month to name a few. However, there have been too many sprinkles of doom among that, and with the nature of their last two losses, questions will inevitably be asked as to where exactly this tremendously expensively assembled ship is heading. As we pointed out earlier this season, Chelsea were largely underperforming when you looked at their underlying numbers. In fact, they are still doing so. According to our expected points model, they should be in fifth place and on at least 38 points, rather than 11th on 31. There is only so long you can give them the benefit of the doubt that it’ll eventually turn around, though. They have taken the 10th-most shots in the Premier League in 2023-24, but only three teams have accumulated a higher overall expected goals (xG) total than their 44.42. However, they have scored just 38 goals, with seven teams managing more. Going the other way, they have faced the eighth-fewest shots, but only six teams have conceded more goals than their 39, which is from an xG against of 35.06. Chelsea have often been the cause of their own issues too, with Tottenham (16) the only team to have made more errors leading to shots than their 15 in the Premier League this season. Pochettino is known for his preference for effective high pressing. At Spurs in the 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons under his guidance, Tottenham were either first or second in the Premier League for PPDA (passes per defensive action), with their average as low as 8.2 in 2015-16 (ranked first). Chelsea currently rank fourth (10.3), behind Liverpool, Arsenal and, of course, Spurs. Interestingly, that is worse than the Blues managed last season, when despite the upheaval of having three different managers, they topped the Premier League for PPDA with 9.7. Chelsea are joint-fifth for high turnovers, sixth for shot-ending high turnovers and joint-10th for goal-ending high turnovers. Unfortunately for them, they have actually conceded more shots (39) and goals (4) from high turnovers than they’ve scored this season (37 and 3). It suggests that, while the building blocks might be there for future success, they are not yet performing Pochettino’s football to the level Spurs managed to. Could the problem be the players, then? On paper, Chelsea’s squad should be the envy of most of Europe. It’s no secret that Arsenal were eager to sign Mykhailo Mudryk last January, while Liverpool ideally wanted Moisés Caicedo and Roméo Lavia to make up a significant chunk of their midfield rebuild last summer. Lavia has barely played so far due to injury, and it would be fair to say that Caicedo has so far not quite lived up to his billing. Any player would struggle to justify a reported £115m cost, but some of the Ecuadorian’s numbers are slightly down on where they were for Brighton last season. In league games, his average number of passes per 90 is very similar, marginally down to 63.2 from 63.3, while his accuracy is up to 91.7% from 88.8%. However, his recoveries per 90 are down to 5.6 from 7.1, his tackles to 2.3 from 2.9, and his interceptions to 0.9 from 1.6, while his duel success is down to 53.2% from 58.5%. Those numbers could be partly due to being in a midfield with a different structure to the one he played in under Roberto De Zerbi, and that also includes another man who cost nine figures. Enzo Fernández was the first big-money arrival under the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital ownership that made people sit up and take notice. Since his £106m move from Benfica in January 2023, he has shown signs of the player who burst onto the scene in the Primeira Liga in the first half of last season before playing a significant role in Argentina winning the 2022 World Cup. His involvement has reduced noticeably at club level, though. While the relative strengths of the Primeira Liga and Premier League must be taken into account, Fernández averaged an astonishing 105.7 passes per 90 for Benfica in the league in his 17 games there, which went down to 82.5 in the second half of the 2022-23 season at Chelsea. It has reduced further to just 69.0 this season, not much more than Caicedo and with a worse (though not bad) accuracy rate of 87.7%. Defensively, his numbers have gone down even from the second half of last season. Fernández is making 2.0 tackles per 90, down from 2.6, 0.76 interceptions per 90, down from 0.93, and 4.6 recoveries per 90, down from 6.9. That could owe to having a more defensive-minded partner in Caicedo this season, though. Both Caicedo and Fernández are undeniably big talents who are still getting used to playing with one another in Pochettino’s system. At 22 and 23 years old respectively they still have high ceilings, and though it’s fair to say they are yet to look like a duo that cost a combined £220m, the general underperformance of the squad means blame must be shared across the board. Pochettino was trying to develop Spurs into a team that dominated possession but progressed the ball quickly, so you would assume his aims have been similar at Chelsea. Five teams have averaged more than their 59.2% possession, while four have made more progressive passes and five have made more progressive carries. These aren’t bad when you consider how low they are in the table, but the Argentine coach would likely still want them to be higher for each metric. Speaking of carries, Nicolas Jackson was signed from Villarreal to presumably help out in that area. He recorded 10 goal involvements from ball carries in La Liga last season, but has just one assist from a carry for Chelsea in the Premier League. The Senegal international has shown some improvement during his first campaign in England, scoring seven goals in 20 games in England’s top flight, but still looks a long way from the player who scored 10 goals in his final 11 league appearances in Spain. Thiago Silva continues to defy the notion that old people are no good at everything, and at 39 he still remains an important part of Chelsea’s defence. Some of his numbers have reduced in the last year, though, such as tackles per 90 (1.1 from 1.5 last season), interceptions per 90 (1.0 from 1.3) and recoveries per 90 (5.1 from 5.7), but he has also been losing possession less often, doing so just 4.8 times per 90, down from 7.4 last season. That, and his other numbers, could be more down to Pochettino’s style than any change in his own game, though. One beaming light in this otherwise forgettable campaign for Chelsea has been Cole Palmer. Some questioned the signing of the England international from Manchester City, but he has really flourished under Pochettino. In fact, Palmer became the first Chelsea player aged 21 or under to hit double figures for goals in a Premier League season (10) when he scored the opener in Sunday’s defeat. If Palmer – who also has four assists in his 20 league games (15 starts) – can thrive in this Chelsea team, the question becomes even greater as to why so few others are. Injuries haven’t helped, though several other Premier League clubs could claim the same thing. When you have as many players on your books as Chelsea it’s tough to garner sympathy for an injury crisis, but that coupled with Pochettino seemingly wanting to try numerous solutions to solve his problems has led to them making 53 changes to their starting XI in the league this season. Of Premier League teams not competing in Europe, only Nottingham Forest (67) and Sheffield United (59) have made more. It has been a tough few years for Chelsea, which the Opta Power Rankings show. Shortly after winning the UEFA Champions League in 2021, they sat inside the top five and stayed there until pretty much the start of the 2022-23 season. Since then, they have been as low as 39th. Despite a slight rise since then, they are back outside the top 30, sitting in 33rd spot after their defeat to Wolves on Sunday, below West Ham, Lens, Lazio and Lille. The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules seem to be taking their toll on Chelsea’s spending, as evidenced by an unusually quiet January transfer window, so they have little choice but to find a way to get more from the already very talented squad they have. Will that be with Pochettino, though? He has proven his Premier League credentials in the past when he somewhat overachieved at Tottenham, but this is clearly a different job for a different club, and it’s anyone’s guess how many more chances he will get. The Chelsea hotseat feels more akin to that at PSG than the one across London, and that didn’t end too well for him. At a press conference on Tuesday, Pochettino told reporters: “Of course, it’s always a tough job. But at the same time it is an exciting project and a project that we know is difficult. In this type of moment, we are living in a situation that is not nice, we can learn. It is a good opportunity to learn. “I told the players today in the meeting that I trust them more than ever. We really trust the players we have. We are going to face this moment knowing we can move back and win games.” So far, it isn’t working, though that’s not to say it can’t. There is the possibility of a trophy before the end of this month, after all. It does go to show, though, that ‘winning the transfer window’ is perhaps not all it’s cracked up to be. Enjoy this?

There have already been quite a few high points in Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal reign, and Sunday brought another. The 3-1 win over Liverpool wasn’t quite going eight points clear at the top of the table by brushing north London rivals Tottenham aside in their own backyard last January. And it didn’t exactly bring the drama of the 90th-minute winners in 3-2 home wins over Bournemouth and Manchester United to keep their title hunt on. In many ways, though, it was as significant and could prove to be even more so. It also might just have been the most morale-boosting of the lot. The victory means Arsenal have won three games in a row to get their season back on track following a run of just one win in five to end 2023. At the turn of the year, it felt like they were out of the title race, but there is no questioning they are back in it after Sunday’s result. Given it had looked like Arsenal’s Premier League campaign might be stuttering, to beat the league leaders so convincingly this week is testament to just how good this team is. What has been so impressive about Arsenal’s development is that they have become such a complete team. They aren’t flawless, of course – their poor run in December proved as much – but they really do have remarkably few weaknesses. And their strengths are so extreme that when they are good, they can beat and outplay just about anyone. As much of that is in how they suffocate opponents and nullify the best attacks in the league as it is in how much quality of their own they have going forwards. At the Emirates on Sunday, Liverpool generated their lowest expected goals total in a Premier League game this season (0.37). They weren’t at their best and were missing a few key players, but much of Liverpool’s lack of cutting edge was the result of Arsenal’s performance without the ball. They pressed relentlessly but were also incredibly solid when they had to drop back into their own half, hence Liverpool’s uncharacteristically low xG numbers. It was also nothing new to see Arsenal dominating against another big side. They have the best record in the league against other ‘big six’ sides this season, with their three wins and three draws meaning they are the only undefeated team in this season’s ‘big six’ mini-league. Of course, this season neither Chelsea nor Manchester United can really be called a “top-six team,” but both often raise their games for those big occasions. Mid-table Chelsea have as many points in ‘big six’ games this season as Manchester City, for example (though from one game fewer for City). Arsenal have now beaten Liverpool and City at home this season, which means that on their own they account for 40% (two of five) of the defeats suffered by their two main rivals for the Premier League title race in 2023-24. The Liverpool win in the context of the recent stretch of three wins showed how this Arsenal team are capable of winning in different ways. They blew a below-par Crystal Palace away to boost their goal difference while rarely looking troubled by a team who chose to sit back and defend deep. They then weren’t at their best at Nottingham Forest but ground out a win and held off a late fightback in testing circumstances. Then they made Liverpool look utterly ordinary while generating more xG (3.5) than any other team has against Liverpool in a Premier League game on record, although the open goals handed to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli will have boosted their numbers. They still deserve credit for getting those chances in the first place, though. Arteta’s side create chances of all kinds. They have scored more set-piece goals (14) than any other team in the Premier League this season, the most headed goals (11), and rank third for counter-attacking goals (5) despite averaging 60.4% possession and dominating territory against most of their opponents. They are also the best pressing team in the Premier League. Only Tottenham (149) have won possession in the final third more times this season than Arsenal (145), but Arsenal lead the way for shots following a high turnover (48). Plenty of fans think they need a more ruthless goalscorer, someone who would help out with the fact only five teams have scored fewer goals than Arsenal following a high turnover (3) despite getting so many chances from their high pressing, but the issue clearly isn’t that simple. If they had a better finisher up front than elite pressers in Gabriel Jesus or Kai Havertz, they wouldn’t generate as many chances from their pressing.   And anyway, if one route to goal isn’t working, Arsenal always have many more to try. Their effective pressing will inevitably lead to more attacking set-pieces, for example, and we’ve already seen how good they are at those. Meanwhile, they also have the best defence in the league. Having conceded a joint-low 22 goals (alongside Liverpool), Arsenal also have the lowest xG against total (17.8). They are miles clear in terms of open-play xG against with a genuinely incredible 13.0 xG conceded in 23 games – just 0.56 per game – with City (16.1) the only other team to have allowed their opponents under 20 xG in open play. Arsenal also lead the way at set-pieces (3.3 xG against), while their average of 0.08 xG per non-penalty shot conceded is the lowest in the league by a distance. They don’t give up many chances, and when they do, they are low-quality ones. Earlier in the season, they were relying too much on that sturdy defence. They laboured to 1-0 wins at Crystal Palace, Brentford and Everton, but while some saw those displays as reason to doubt Arsenal’s title credentials, they can now be seen as them keeping pace at the top while winning ugly. Arsenal will hope performances like those have now been left in the past, particularly because even in the recent run of poor form before Christmas they were creating enough chances to win the games. After being outperformed in terms of xG in four of their first 11 Premier League games this season, Arsenal have conceded more xG than they have created in just one of their last 12 league games – the 1-1 draw at Anfield on 23 December. Part of that will be down to game state – Arsenal have had to chase the game having gone behind against Luton, Aston Villa, West Ham and Fulham since the start of December – but they also spent long periods level in games earlier in the season and struggled to create much of note. Perhaps most crucially, Arteta believes his team have turned a corner. “The schedule that we had prior to Christmas, the amount of players that played so many minutes and the injuries that we had, we needed to recharge,” the Arsenal manager said after the Liverpool game on Sunday. “Now we’ve got some momentum back. Three really convincing wins in a row, the team playing really well, and we have to go for it. The whole season is now ahead of us. We need players back because we have a few injuries. That’s the big concern I have. If we have everybody fit, training and available then we have a good chance.” This brings us nicely on to Arsenal’s (very few) weaknesses, one of which Arteta has hinted at there: they rely too heavily on certain individuals. No team has used fewer players in the Premier League this season than Arsenal (23), while they have had more outfielders start 19 or more of their league games (seven) than any other side. It should be said here that clearly a lack of injury proneness is an extremely valuable trait that Arteta looks for in his players. That will have, for example, driven up Declan Rice’s price in the summer. Rice has started all 23 of Arsenal’s Premier League games this season and nobody has complained about how much Arsenal paid for him. Fans would probably still be happy with him if he’d cost £150m.  But having so many players available has a downside in that much of the second string don’t get enough game time to get match-sharp. That exacerbates the problem of Arsenal’s first team being so much better than the back-up players, and makes the drop-off so big in certain areas that Arteta doesn’t feel able to rotate and give everyone a rest. It’s no surprise that they had started to tire – most probably mentally as well as physically – by the time the busy festive schedule came around. A blip was as expected as it was understandable. The fact that the bulk of their disappointing results have come against upper mid-table teams may have been incidental or it may point to another weakness that this team needs to address. Arsenal have lost four league games this season, and three of those have come against teams currently occupying positions between fourth and ninth in the table. Fulham, currently 13th, are the only exception. Do Arsenal underestimate teams like West Ham, Aston Villa and Newcastle? Do the players (and fans?) struggle to motivate themselves for these games as much as they so clearly do for games against Liverpool, City and United? That would seem odd for such a professional, high-quality team but it is still something for Arteta to consider with return games against West Ham and Newcastle in the next few weeks. In the grand scheme of things, having a first team that is too good to rotate or a lack of motivation against certain teams aren’t major problems, and crucially, both may well have been solved by the mid-season refresh Arsenal have just enjoyed thanks to the winter break. Arsenal looked raring to go against Liverpool, and that was reflected in the impressive performance and result. They are now very much back in the title race and there’s good reason to believe they will be sticking about at the top of the table for a while longer yet.  Arteta will know they aren’t the favourites, but the pressure of a lead at the top of the table got to them last season, so he might even prefer the position his team are in this time around. They are stronger than they were a year ago and ready to make this season’s title race more competitive than last. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the clash at Al Thumama Stadium in Doha with our Iran vs Qatar prediction and preview. The second semi-final of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup takes place in Doha on Wednesday, with both sides already knowing who will await them in the final should they progress. Iran eased through the group stage with victories over United Arab Emirates, Palestine and Hong Kong, with their seven goals coming via six different players – a display of their strength in depth in attacking positions. Star player Mehdi Taremi scored twice in the final group game against UAE before his successful penalty versus Syria in the round of 16 helped them eventually progress after extra-time and a shootout. Despite Taremi’s suspension for the quarter-finals, Iran beat the tournament favourites Japan 2-1 after going in to half-time behind, thanks to a 55th-minute strike from Mohammad Mohebi before a dramatic winner from Alireza Jahanbakhsh six minutes into added time. Taremi’s return to the fold cannot be understated. Despite missing the last round, he’s their most prolific shot-taker at this tournament (14 shots) and only Sardar Azmoun (0.64) has a higher non-penalty expected goals per 90 average than him (0.41). As two of the top four scorers in Iran’s national team history, Qatar will need to keep a close eye on the pair. Meanwhile, right-back Ramin Razaeian has been instrumental in providing service into the box. Leading the team in crosses in open play with 14, Razaeian’s deliveries have been crucial in creating goal-scoring opportunities for Iran. Additionally, his ability to create chances for teammates (8) underscores his importance in Iran’s attacking build-up. In midfield, Saman Ghoddos emerges as a key metronome, seamlessly orchestrating Iran’s play. Ghoddos’ distribution in the back third has been pivotal in initiating attacks, while his defensive contributions are equally impressive. Ghoddos leads all Iran outfielders for ball recoveries at the tournament (31), showcasing his versatility in both offensive and defensive phases of the game. With two assists to his name, Ghoddos is also among the leading Iran players for expected assists per 90 at the tournament, with his 0.23 average below only Azmoun’s 0.28. Qatar won all three of their group stage games against Tajikistan, China PR and Lebanon without conceding a single goal. After winning their last-16 tie against Palestine (2-1), the quarter-final match against Uzbekistan saw them fail to win inside 90 minutes for the first time at the 2023 edition. Of course, they eventually battled through extra-time and won a penalty shootout 3-2 to advance to this stage. Key player Akram Afif has been instrumental in Qatar’s attacking threat. Deployed on the left side, Afif’s ability to cut and dribble inside onto his favoured right foot has been a constant menace for opposing defences. With a team-high 13 chances created and 12 successful take-ons, Afif leads Qatar’s offensive charge and epitomises their threat in the final third. In defence, the trio of Tarek Salman, Almahdi, and Lucas Mendes has been pivotal in limiting opposition threats. Qatar’s defensive record, having conceded only two goals in the competition so far, owes much to their collective defensive efforts. Salman’s leadership at the back, coupled with Almahdi’s organisational skills and Mendes’s defensive dominance forms the bedrock of Qatar’s defensive stability. However, they face uncertainty regarding the availability of Farrukh Sayfiev and Sultan Al Brake, who may be game-time decisions due to injuries. Tactically, Qatar in possession take up a 3-5-2 shape with full-backs pushing high up the pitch to provide width, along with one of the strikers dropping deeper to create a midfield diamond in the build-up. Dealing with this overload in midfield will be important for Iran if they wish to maintain control of the game in the centre of the park.\\xa0 Qatar out of possession are generally passive, favouring a mid/low block 5-3-2 shape and wanting to keep the game in front of them.\\xa0 Iran should be looking for opportunities in transition when they can win the ball high up or even in the middle third when the Qatari full-backs are high. This will give the likes of winger Jahanbakhsh the chance to attack the space left outside the three central defenders. It will be an interesting tactical battle given the risk-averse approach of both nations. This will be the third meeting between Iran and Qatar at the AFC Asian Cup. Iran have won both of their previous two meetings without conceding a single goal – a 2-0 win in the group stage in 1988 and a 1-0 victory in the group stage of the 2015 edition. Their last meeting came in October 2023, with Iran running out 4-0 winners in a friendly thanks to goals from Hossein Kanani (2), Sardar Azmoun and Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Iran are predicted to make it through to the AFC Asian Cup final, with the Opta supercomputer seeing them defeat hosts Qatar inside 90 minutes across 42.2% of simulations before kick-off. Qatar won 31.7% of those, while 26.1% of those games ended in a draw and went to extra time. Overall, Iran are just behind South Korea as favourites to win the Asian Cup outright, with both of these big AFC national teams ahead of Qatar and Jordan in the Opta supercomputer’s projections.

Our latest edition includes numbers on Arsenal’s win over Liverpool, Sheffield United’s latest defeat, and woodwork rattlers. Another Premier League matchday is in the can, and boy there were a lot of goals. Forty-five were scored in total, the highest scoring matchday in a 20-team season (since 1995-96) and the second-highest in Premier League history (after 53 goals on the final day of 1992-93). That included five goals at Bramall Lane. Unfortunately for Sheffield United, Aston Villa claimed all of them, sending Chris Wilder’s men on course for a most unwanted record that we’ll delve a little deeper into here. Arsenal blew the title race wide open again with a win over Liverpool, and in doing so, did something to the Reds that no-one else has been able to before.

When Sheffield United were thumped 8-0 at home by Newcastle United earlier this season, it was a real low point. The last thing they would have wanted would be to allow a moment where people could justifiably say: “Uh oh, it’s happening again.” After just 30 minutes at Bramall Lane, Aston Villa were already halfway to Newcastle’s total and déjà vu was presumably setting in for the Blades. Mercifully, just one more goal arrived and Sheffield United were only dispatched 5-0, but it did leave them in another ominous position. Not only bottom of the table and 10 points from safety having played a game more than 17th-place Luton Town, but also having conceded 59 goals from their 23 games; the most a team has ever conceded at this stage of a Premier League season. Relegation seems a near certainty, but what must they do to avoid the ignominy of breaking the record for most goals conceded in Premier League history? That record currently sits with Swindon Town, who saw 100 go past them in their one and only Premier League campaign back in 1993-94. However, that was a 42-game season, with Swindon conceding 2.38 goals per game. That is the most goals per game (GPG) conceded in Premier League history, but Sheffield United’s GPG conceded currently stands at 2.56. If that rate continues, they will end the season having let in 97 goals. In a 38-game season, Derby perhaps unsurprisingly hold the record, with their famous 11-point campaign in 2007-08 seeing 89 goals conceded at 2.34 per game. So, in their final 15 games, Sheffield United must concede fewer than 31 goals. Doable, but you’d also be a brave person to bet against them taking the crown. Still, it’s nice to have something to aim for, which must be what opponents think when looking at their goal. It was a huge win for Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. You don’t have your captain celebrate with the club cameraman for just any old victory, after all. Their 3-1 win over Liverpool was not just impressive because it brought them back into the Premier League title race, though. The Gunners also achieved something else. Arsenal’s expected goals (xG) total of 3.5 was the highest faced by Liverpool in a Premier League game on record. Not bad when you’re facing a team top of the league who had only lost one of their 22 games at that point. It must be said that a good portion of their xG came from Arsenal’s first two goals. Bukayo Saka’s opener had an xG value of 0.44 after he was left with a simple finish following Alisson’s save from Kai Havertz. Gabriel Martinelli making it 2-1 came after a howler from both Liverpool’s goalkeeper and Virgil van Dijk, presenting the Brazilian with an open goal at an xG of 0.75. Leandro Trossard’s game clincher in stoppage time had an xG of just 0.04, but that may have been due to the fact it was at an angle, and it was the deflection off Van Dijk’s toe that took it into the net. Arsenal had eight chances with a higher xG than Liverpool’s highest, which came from Luis Díaz in the opening minute of the second half (0.1). Gabriel’s own goal that drew the visitors level just before half-time did not record an xG amount, but it felt like it would take something like that for Jürgen Klopp’s men to find the net. So, a good day at the office for Arsenal and a bad one for Liverpool. We appear to have a three-way title race on our hands, and we can expect an exciting three-and-a-half months ahead. There were oodles of goals scored in the Premier League this weekend, while there were also plenty of stats and facts to build a quiz from, which is handy.

Which former Leeds, Coventry City and Middlesbrough striker is the only other player to do so (in December 1995)? This week’s question comes from Silvestar Bistrović, who asks:\\xa0“With Darwin Núñez hitting the woodwork like crazy, I wonder who has the most woodwork hits per season and overall?” Do you have a stat-based question you’d like Opta to answer in a future edition of SVQ? Email us at\\xa0editors@theanalyst.com\\xa0or message us on X\\xa0@OptaAnalyst\\xa0with #AskOpta and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: You’re not wrong, Silvestar. Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez has been hitting the post and crossbar so often you wonder if someone has played a trick on him by saying you get awarded two goals for doing so. He hit the woodwork four times against Chelsea last week, the most in a single Premier League game by one player on record (since 2003-04). For clarity, Opta defines the ‘hit woodwork’ stat as\\xa0“When the ball hits any part of the goal frame but does not enter the net as a direct consequence,”\\xa0so scoring after hitting the inside of the post or underside of the bar does not count. Núñez has struck the woodwork nine times in the Premier League so far this season, at least six more than any other player (seven players have done so three times). In fact, the only player to have hit the woodwork more often in a Premier League season on record is Robin van Persie, who did so 10 times in 2011-12, when he also scored 30 goals in his final campaign for Arsenal. Núñez has another 15 possible games to take that record, though presumably won’t want to. Kevin De Bruyne in 2016-17 and Harry Kane in 2020-21 also recorded nine woodwork hits each in the league, but perhaps most notably, so did Luis Suárez in 2013-14 when he scored 31 Premier League goals in 33 games. The Uruguayan has been a big advocate of his compatriot Núñez, and if the 24-year-old can develop into anything like the player Suárez did at Anfield, it’ll be quite something. In Europe’s top five leagues this season, no other player has hit the woodwork more than four times, but generally there is quite a lot of proof that doing so with regularity is actually the sign of a high-quality player. There have been nine instances of a player doing so at least 10 times in a season, and Lionel Messi is responsible for six of those. The others are Cristiano Ronaldo (2012-13), Van Persie and, erm, Bakary Sako. The former Wolves striker scored only four goals in 36 Ligue 1 games for Saint-Étienne in 2011-12, but he also hit the woodwork 10 times. As for overall, the all-star top five list from Europe’s big five leagues (league only) since records began are Messi (116), Ronaldo (106), Karim Benzema (67), Robert Lewandowski (63) and Suárez (60).

Who has assisted the most goals for a single club? Has anyone assisted four goals in a game? We answer all these questions – and more – in our detailed look at assists in the history of the Premier League. As a player who has 632 Premier League appearances under his belt, it’s probably unsurprising that Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs tops the list of leading Premier League assisters. The Welshman provided 162 assists over his Premier League career, which is 51 more than the next best player: Cesc Fàbregas. Fàbregas leads the charts in terms of non-British players, with his 111 Premier League assists coming across 350 games for Arsenal and Chelsea.  The only other three players to reach the century of assists in the Premier League are Kevin De Bruyne (105), Wayne Rooney (103), and Frank Lampard (102). De Bruyne recently overtook Steven Gerrard (92) and former teammate David Silva (93) before surpassing Dennis Bergkamp’s Premier League assist tally of 94 in early October 2022. He’s went ahead of Wayne Rooney’s 103 assists following his quick-thinking free kick at home to Burnley on 31 January 2024 to assist Julián Álvarez’s second goal of the match. The Belgian became the fifth player to hit 100 assists in the competition on 8 April 2023 with his cross for Erling Haaland away at Southampton, and the only other current Premier League player near the landmark is James Milner (89). Even Milner would accept that age isn’t on his side to reach the century, though. Of course, as a one-club man during his career, it’s obvious that Giggs’ 162 Premier League assists also leads this category, with only Wayne Rooney (93) and David Beckham (80) appearing in the top 10 for Manchester United. But there are some interesting differences in the rankings. Bergkamp has assisted the sixth-most goals in Premier League history overall, but his 94 assists all came for Arsenal in the competition. This means his tally is the third-highest for a single club in the competition. Fàbregas has assisted the second-most goals in the Premier League overall (111), but only 70 of these came at Arsenal, with the other 41 coming in a Chelsea shirt. Steven Gerrard’s 92 Premier League assists all came for Liverpool – with his feats for the Reds meaning he’s one of only 10 players to have assisted 70+ goals exclusively for one club. Of current Premier League players, only De Bruyne appears with his 104 assists for Man City.  His century of Premier League assists at City arrived on 15 April, when Pep Guardiola’s side defeated Leicester City at the Etihad Stadium – the landmark was reached thanks to creating Haaland’s second goal of the match. His first assist in the competition came in a Chelsea shirt in their win over Hull at Stamford Bridge. This assist for Oscar’s goal was the first goal scored in José Mourinho’s second spell as Blues manager.  In 2019-20, Kevin De Bruyne finally ended a 17-year wait for someone to equal Thierry Henry’s phenomenal tally of 20 Premier League assists in 2002-03. Whilst the Belgian’s overall output that season was impressive with 13 goals to add to his 20 assists, it wasn’t as impressive as Henry’s 2002-03 campaign where the French forward added 24 goals to his 20 assists. His 44 goal involvements for the Gunners that season are the most ever seen by a player in a 38-game Premier League campaign. Mesut Özil led the way for assists in 2015-16, with 19 for his Arsenal teammates in 35 top-flight appearances. Sixteen of these came in his first 18 games of that season, with the German international midfielder set to absolutely smash Henry’s previous record of 20, but the final 17 appearances that campaign only yielded three more assists, including one on the final day in a 4-0 win over Aston Villa. Özil’s 2015-16 tally was two more than he ever managed in a season at La Liga club Real Madrid, with his 17 passes leading to goals in 2010-11 and 2011-12 the best he managed in Spain. De Bruyne joined this list in 2022-23 – finishing on 16 assists, which was four more than both Mohamed Salah and Leandro Trossard (12). What’s better than a hat-trick of assists? Well, more than three in a game, probably. We’ve only witnessed eight occasions of a player assisting four goals in a single Premier League match, with Jérémy Doku’s four assists (on top of a goal scored) for Man City in their 6-1 win over Bournemouth on 4 November 2023 being the first since Paul Pogba’s quadruple for Man Utd against Leeds United in 2021-22. The first six occasions between the inaugural 1992-93 season to 2020-21 all came from either an Arsenal player (four) or from someone playing for Spurs (two). Dennis Bergkamp – Arsenal vs. Leicester City (20 February 1999)José Antonio Reyes – Arsenal vs. Middlesbrough (14 January 2006)Cesc Fàbregas – Arsenal vs. Blackburn Rovers (4 October 2009)Emmanuel Adebayor – Tottenham Hotspur vs. Newcastle United (11 February 2012)Santi Cazorla – Arsenal vs. Wigan Athletic (14 May 2013)Harry Kane – Tottenham Hotspur vs. Southampton (20 September 2020)Paul Pogba – Manchester United vs. Leeds United (14 August 2021)Jérémy Doku – Manchester City vs. Bournemouth (4 November 2023) Of the eight players listed above, Doku, Fàbregas, Adebayor and Kane also scored a goal in this match – meaning they were involved in five goals in total in that performance. This isn’t a record for goal involvements in a single game, with both Jürgen Klinsmann (Spurs vs. Wimbledon in May 1998) and Alan Shearer (Newcastle vs. Sheffield Wednesday in September 1999) having six goal involvements in those appearances. Bet you didn’t open this article and expect to read about Alan Kimble, did you? Well, you’re here and this is happening. Wikipedia tells us that Kimble “was known to get to the byline and lump the ball upfield to the strikers”. Well, it worked, as he assisted 24 goals in the Premier League for the Dons – that’s a joint-high with Neil Ardley. Unfortunately for Kimble, his gifts were never reciprocated by his teammates. He never scored a goal in his 181 appearances in the Premier League. This makes him the player to have assisted the most goals in the Premier League without having scored one himself. Special mentions to both Vladimír Coufal (17 assists) and Kenny Cunningham (16) as well as Rob Jones (11) for also setting up teammates for goals but never being scorers themselves. However, Cunningham scores an extra point for being the outfield player to have played the most Premier League games without ever scoring (335 apps).  Two 16-year-olds have assisted a Premier League goal since it began in 1992.  Rooney may be one of only four players to have assisted over 100 Premier League goals, but he was beaten to the youngest record by Aaron Lennon by 98 days. Lennon assisted a goal in Leeds United’s defeat to Arsenal at Elland Road in November 2003 while aged just 16 years and 199 days old. This eclipses Rooney’s assist for Everton against Spurs in August 2002 when he was only 16 years, 297 days old. Jonathan Leko only ever assisted two goals in his 14 Premier League appearances, but both came as a 17-year-old – one of only 16 players to assist a goal in the competition before their 18th birthday. We could have given you 100 guesses to correctly get the oldest player to ever assist a goal in the Premier League, and we’re very confident you wouldn’t have picked it right. Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar assisted a goal for Manchester United in their February 2011 meeting at Old Trafford with Aston Villa when aged 40 years, 95 days old – the oldest assister for a goal in the history of the competition. This was the Dutchman’s only Premier League assist, coming in his last of 10 seasons as a player in the competition. On the subject of goalkeepers, Paul Robinson assisted the most goals in the Premier League of all goalkeepers (five), while he was also one of only five to score a goal in the competition, thanks to his 2007 strike against Watford at White Hart Lane. Fellow former England international Teddy Sheringham is the oldest outfielder to assist a goal in the Premier League, setting up a teammate in West Ham’s game with Wigan back in March 2006 at 39 years, 357 days old – just shy of his 40th birthday.

We look back at the players to score the most Premier League hat-tricks since the inception of the competition in 1992. Everyone knows that Brian Deane scored the first Premier League goal, but fewer people are aware that the first Premier League hat-trick was scored in that same holy month of August 1992 by Eric Cantona, then of Leeds United. The newly-constituted English top flight then had to wait until November to see another treble, this time from Norwich City’s Mark Robins, and by the end of the 1992-93 there had been 14 in total, including one from the 36-year-old Gordon Strachan, which would remain the oldest treble in the Premier League for a decade, until a 37-year-old Teddy Sheringham took the mantle.  The symbolism and importance of scoring a hat-trick remains undimmed in football, the ceremonial handing over of the match ball to the player, the additional kudos if the hat-trick was “perfect” (one right-footed goal, one left-footed goal and a headed goal), the rare occasions where a player goes berserk and pushes past three goals to score four or five times. The first 30 Premier League seasons saw 361 hat-tricks scored, an average of about 12 per campaign, but we are yet to see a player score a double hat-trick. Five players, though, have scored five goals in a game so it’s fitting that one of those men leads the Premier League for all-time hat-tricks: Señor Hat-Trick himself, Sergio Agüero. Sergio Agüero announced himself to English football on a hot evening in August 2011, coming off the bench for Manchester City and scoring two goals against Swansea City. Any concerns that he would struggle to adapt to the Premier League were ended that night and it only took him a few weeks to score his first hat-trick in the competition, rattling home three goals against Wigan Athletic in September.  Curiously for a player so adept and consistent in front of goal, his next Premier League treble wouldn’t arrive until 2014 and, like a sort of footballing Obi-Wan Kenobi, Agüero’s hat-trick powers became more powerful the older he got.  As he turned 29 in 2017 he had five hat-tricks, but then scored seven more aged 29-31, including two in the space of a week in February 2019 versus Arsenal and Chelsea. Agüero’s 12th hat-trick, which gave him the Premier League record, came against Aston Villa in January 2020 and in the process saw him overtake Thierry Henry as the highest non-English goalscorer in Premier League history. The Premier League’s record goalscorer was its record hat-trick scorer for a long time, and like a Gen-X music journalist his hat-trick record owes a lot, perhaps too much, to the years 1995 and 1996.  It barely seems credible but in the space of 476 days between 26 November 1994 and 16 March 1996 Shearer scored eight hat-tricks, including five in the 1995-96 season alone (unsurprisingly a Premier League record).  Although Shearer scored more goals for Newcastle than Blackburn Rovers, nine of his 11 hat-tricks came for the Lancashire club, an era when his mobility, pace and shooting ability combined to make him an utter menace.  His final flourish in this department was the five goal blitz he recorded against Sheffield Wednesday in September 1999. A man of the 1990s, scoring 11 hat-tricks in the 1990s; you can’t get purer than that. Oh, and given that no-one aged under 18 has scored a Premier League hat-trick it should be pointed out that Shearer scored three times on his full First Division debut for Southampton back in 1988 as a 17-year-old, setting a record in a career that would be chock full of them. Robbie Fowler just oozed hat-tricks as a Premier League player. Two for Liverpool as a teenager, the second of which stood as the competition’s fastest for a long time, five before he had turned 22 and two in the same season for two different clubs in the space of two months in 2001-02. That treble for Leeds was the last hat-trick Fowler scored, but he remains the only player to score four left-footed goals in a single Premier League match, and did so twice, against Bolton in 1995 and Middlesbrough in 1996. That left foot should be in a museum. Harry Kane scored a lot of goals for Tottenham Hotspur, we know this. We also know that Harry Kane used to score a lot of Premier League hat-tricks. Specifically in the year 2015 and the year 2017. Kane scored two in 2015 as a promising youngster then in 2017 he scored a barely credible six hat-tricks in a single year, including two in four days in May and two in four days at Christmas. Yet after that hat-trick for Spurs against Southampton on Boxing Day 2017, the England captain and World Cup Golden Boot winner did not register another in his domestic league. Now in the Bundesliga at Bayern Munich, it took Kane just five games to score his first German top-flight hat-trick, while he added hat-tricks two and three in appearances nine and 10 in the competition. Of course, the German’s don’t consider it a hat-trick unless a player scores all three goals consecutively in a match, but we’ll let Kane fight that battle. Thierry Henry is the only four-time Premier League Golden Boot winner so it’s no shock to see hat-tricks playing a major part in his dominance.  His first came against Leicester City in 2000 as a 23-year-old but it was the latter part of his Premier League career where Henry really found his hat-trick groove, often registering them in neat pairs before he left England for Spain. There were two in April 2004 against Liverpool and Leeds United as Arsenal neared completion of their Invincible season, two more in March/April 2005 and then the last two in January/May 2006, the final treble coming in the final ever game at Highbury, against Wigan Athletic.  Henry was indelibly linked to Highbury so it’s apt that all eight of his Premier League hat-tricks for the Gunners came at that much-missed venue. The third player with eight Premier League hat-tricks to his name is also the only pre-adult to ever score a penalty in the Premier League; Michael Owen.  The former Liverpool, Newcastle United and Man Utd striker’s career was incredibly front loaded, a star that burned so brightly early on before injuries took their toll. This fact is illustrated by the fact that three of Owen’s hat-tricks came when he was 18, and four of the remaining five before he turned 24.  Indeed, only four players have ever scored Premier League hat-tricks as an 18-year-old. Owen has three, Robbie Fowler has one, Evan Ferguson scored one in 2023-24 against Newcastle, and for the big cash prize the fourth is Chris Bart-Williams for Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.  Owen’s eighth and final Premier League hat-trick came in December 2005 for Newcastle against West Ham. At that stage Owen already felt like some sort of grizzled veteran even though this treble came only three days after his 26th birthday. Owen also remains one of only three players to score a hat-trick on Valentine’s Day, along with Matthew Le Tissier and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. You love to see it. As one of only three players – so far – to score more than 200 Premier League goals, Rooney’s appearance in this list is not surprising. Unlike, say, Fowler, Kane or Owen, Rooney did spread his Premier League hat-tricks across a long period of time, his first coming for Manchester United against Bolton in 2006 and the seventh coming for Everton against West Ham in 2017. The final goal of his final treble came, naturally, from his own half. Pure Rooney, pure length. The list of clubs Luis Suárez scored Premier League hat-tricks against is not the most glamorous, but one specific name does stand out.  In chronological order they go: Norwich, Norwich, Wigan, West Brom, Norwich, Cardiff. That’s right, 1.8% of all the goals Norwich have ever conceded in the Premier League were to Suarez, and he only ever played six games against them.  When he scored the fourth of his six hat-tricks, in October 2013, he was averaging a hat-trick every 20.1 games, an extraordinary rate from a player who created headlines as relentlessly as he tormented Norfolk’s leading football club. If you’ve read this far then it’s fair to assume that you really really enjoy hat-tricks, so why not feast on this bonus supercut of Premier League hat-trick information. • Erling Haaland already has five Premier League hat-tricks to his name, reaching the milestone in just 39 Premier League appearances. In doing so, he smashed the previous record for the fewest games needed to score five Premier League hat-tricks, previously held by Ruud van Nistelrooy, who needed 73 games. • Son Heung-min and Mohamed Salah are the only currently active Premier League players on four hat-tricks. • Robbie Fowler has scored more perfect hat-tricks (header, right foot and left foot) than any other player, with three.  • Former Bolton man Fredi Bobic remains the lowest scoring player to have a Premier League hat-trick to his name, scoring four goals overall, with three of them coming against Ipswich in 2002.  • Fabrizio Ravanelli remains the only player to score a Premier League hat-trick on his debut, doing so for Middlesbrough against Liverpool in August 1996 – one of just 10 opening day hat-tricks in the Premier League. • Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains the only substitute to score four goals in a single game, doing so for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest in 1999.  • Sadio Mané exited the Premier League last summer but surely no-one will beat his fastest hat-trick record (2m 56s) set for Southampton against Aston Villa in May 2015. • When Cristiano Ronaldo scored three times against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in March 2022 he set a new record gap between Premier League hat-tricks, at 14 years & 59 days. • Wigan against Blackburn in 2007 is the only Premier League game to see a player from each side score a hat-trick: Marcus Bent and Roque Santa Cruz respectively.  • Emmanuel Adebayor is the only player to score a hat-trick home and away against the same opponent in the same season, doing so against that Derby County side in 2007-08. • Three Premier League games have seen two players score hat-tricks for the same team: Jermaine Pennant and Robert Pires for Arsenal against Southampton in 2003, while Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy did this for Leicester, also against Southampton, in Saints’ infamous 9-0 home defeat in October 2019. Erling Haaland and Phil Foden made it three with their two hat-tricks in Manchester City’s 6-3 win over Manchester United in October 2022. • Oh and the wait goes on for a defender hat-trick in the Premier League. Everton’s Steve Watson is often cited for his treble against Leeds United in 2003 but sadly he was acting as a midfielder that day. Hat-tricks. You have to love them. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the match at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan with our Jordan vs South Korea prediction and preview. Jordan’s journey to the Asian Cup semi-finals has been marked by some impressive performances. In the group stage, they showcased their prowess with a commanding 4-0 victory against Malaysia and a hard-fought 2-2 draw against South Korea. A 1-0 triumph over Bahrain in their final group match solidified their place in the knockout stage. Their last-16 clash was arguably one of the most dramatic seen at the tournament so far as they won 3-2 against Iraq in normal time, despite trailing as late as the 94th minute. With Iraq down to 10 men, Jordan capitalised with an equaliser from Yazan Al-Arab in the 95th minute and a winner two minutes later from Nizar Al-Rashdan. Less drama was on display in their quarter-final as they squeezed past Tajikistan by a single goal – an own goal in the 66th minute by Vahdat Hanonov – to reach the AFC Asian Cup semis for the first time ever. Drawing inspiration from their earlier 2-2 deadlock against South Korea in the group stage, Jordan can enter the semi-final with confidence they can match it against a familiar foe. However, the absence of striker Ali Olwan and defender Salem Al-Ajalin due to suspension adds an extra challenge at both ends of the pitch.  With Olwan Jordan’s leading player for successful take-ons in the final third (12), much of the attacking threat will be placed on the shoulders of Mousa Tamari out on the right wing. Al-Ajalin, whose been deployed in every match at the tournament in the left centre-back role, will be missed within the backline as a great option to build attacks on the left side, where he’s consistently linked up with winger Mahmoud Al Mardi. South Korea’s journey to the semis has been characterised by resilience and heroics late on in matches. They started the tournament well with a 3-1 win over Bahrain, before two draws against Jordan (2-2) and Malaysia (3-3) saw them finish second in Group E. Despite this, they did finish the group stage with eight goals – a tally no other side could do better than. Finishing second in the group handed them a tricky last-16 tie with Saudi Arabia, where they looked to be heading out until Cho Gue-sung’s equaliser in the 99th minute. They held out in extra time, before dispatching of the Saudis 4-2 in a penalty shootout to set up a quarter-final meeting with Australia. They again did it the hard way as they advanced past the Socceroos, conceding first and only equalising deep into added time at the end of the match via a Hwang Hee-chan penalty. It was Son Heung-min who ended as the hero on this occasion, with his exceptional free kick in extra time sending South Korea into the semis. With South Korea already being taken to extra time twice in this tournament, they could do without the same again. Tottenham forward Son has played every single minute of their campaign so far, being on the pitch for 601 minutes, including all added time across their five matches – the most by a player at this tournament. His three goals are level-best for South Korea at this tournament alongside Lee Kang-in, with the 22-year-old Paris Saint-Germain star the leading chance creator at the Asian Cup so far (17). Jürgen Klinsmann will have to do without talismanic centre-back Kim Min-jae for this game, however. The Bayern Munich defender is suspended, with Son’s leadership even more important with such a senior figure of the squad out of action for this crucial tie. Their AFC Asian Cup 2023 group stage meeting was the first international between South Korea and Jordan in nearly 10 years, after previously playing a friendly match in November 2014. The group stage game between these two nations ended 2-2, with Son opening the scoring from a ninth-minute penalty kick. Jordan took a shock 2-1 lead into half-time, however, following an own goal via Park Yong-woo and a first-half injury time strike from forward Yazan Al-Naimat. They nearly hung on for a crucial victory, but South Korea forced an added time equaliser via an Yazan Al-Arab own goal.  A point was more than deserved for South Korea based on the match stats, with them attempting nearly twice as many shots as Jordan (23 vs 12) and posting a much higher expected goals (xG) total overall (2.15 vs 0.27). South Korea are the favourites to progress to the AFC Asian Cup 2023 final in this tie with the Opta supercomputer. The Taegeuk Warriors won 55.9% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations inside 90 minutes – something South Korea would surely be happy with having to go through extra time in each of the last two rounds. Jordan won just over one-in-five of the simulations ahead of kick-off (21.7%) and are the tournament outsiders among the four teams left at this Asian Cup in Qatar.

We look back at all the important data angles from the game with our Arsenal vs Liverpool stats report. Liverpool suffered just their second defeat of the Premier League season as they lost 3-1 to Arsenal. Both of those defeats have come in north London (the other vs Tottenham in September), with this loss opening the exciting 2023-24 title race up once more. The Reds still lead the Premier League table ahead of Arsenal by two points but know that Manchester City could now overtake them if they win their two games in hand, both coming against Brentford this month. It took a terrible mix-up between the usually-dependant Alisson and Virgil van Dijk in the 67th minute for Arsenal to eventually decide the game. Gabriel Martinelli took full advantage of the pair’s inability to deal with a seemingly innocuous ball over the top for his third goal in as many league appearances. Overall, the Brazilian has now scored five goals against Liverpool in all competitions – against no side has he scored more for Arsenal. Liverpool had won a league-high 19 points from losing positions coming into this match, so after Luis Díaz saw his cutback cannon off Gabriel Magalhães’ arm and into the goal deep into first-half injury time, the writing seemed on the wall for another crucial Liverpool comeback. It wasn’t to be, though. It was nearly the perfect first half for Arsenal. One-nil ahead thanks to Bukayo Saka’s 14th-minute strike, it looked like they would head into the break with a slender lead from a dominant attacking performance across the opening 45 minutes. However, Gabriel’s own goal sent Liverpool in level at the break without even attempting a shot on target. Arsenal had taken the lead after Reds’ captain Van Dijk had been drawn from a central defensive position, leaving space for Kai Havertz to run in behind. The former Chelsea man found himself one-on-one with Alisson but based on his finishing in the Premier League so far across his career, not many would have fancied him to score. As it turned out, he didn’t. Thankfully for the German, Saka was perfectly placed to slam home the rebound and put Arsenal 1-0 in front. Saka’s goal made him just the second Premier League player this season to score more than 10 goals (11) and provide more than 10 assists (12) across all competitions – along with Liverpool’s Darwin Núñez. That strike also saw Arsenal score first against Liverpool for the fourth successive Premier League meeting, but unlike the game at Anfield earlier this season, they went on to pick up all three points on this occasion. It was a meek attacking performance from Liverpool, who didn’t even attempt a shot on target until the 62nd minute. Expected goals (xG) don’t always show the true story of a single match, but in this case, they truthfully display Arsenal dominance in this win. Their xG total of 3.52 was the highest xG conceded by Liverpool in the Premier League on record, overtaking Man City’s 3.47 on 7 February 2021, which included a penalty kick. Ibrahima Konaté’s 88th-minute red card – Liverpool’s fifth of the Premier League season, which equals a club record in the competition – left further gaps at the back and Arsenal were able to capitalise to seal the game in injury time. Leandro Trossard put the icing on the cake with his goal in the 92nd minute, finishing through Alisson’s legs via a slight deflection. The Premier League title may not be won or lost by this result, but it will have certainly given Arsenal confidence when they needed it most. It also dents Liverpool’s momentum ahead of an important six weeks in which they play in the EFL Cup final at Wembley and finish with back-to-back Premier League games against title rivals Man City and local rivals Everton.

We look ahead to the clash with our Brentford vs Manchester City prediction and preview. Manchester City will be looking to keep the pressure on Premier League leaders Liverpool when they visit Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Monday, armed with the fit-again Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. De Bruyne started for the first time since his four-month injury absence on Wednesday, assisting birthday boy Julián Álvarez’s second goal before Rodri – teed up by Phil Foden – added another in a convincing 3-1 victory over relegation-threatened Burnley at Etihad Stadium. A quick-thinking free-kick routine, sliding through the middle for Álvarez to convert past former City goalkeeper James Trafford, took De Bruyne to 104 Premier League assists and saw him surpass Wayne Rooney (103) to become the outright third-highest assist provider in Premier League history – behind only Ryan Giggs (162) and Cesc Fàbregas (111). Indeed, despite playing just 199 minutes across six appearances in all competitions this season, the Belgian maestro has been involved in five goals (one goal, four assists), averaging a goal involvement every 40 minutes so far this term. Since the start of last season, De Bruyne has provided 32 assists in all competitions, eight more than any other Premier League player – Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah his nearest challenger with 24. Somehow, De Bruyne’s brilliance overshadowed the return of Haaland against Burnley on Matchday 22 as the world-class Norwegian talisman appeared from the bench after coming back from almost two months on the sidelines. His availability, coupled with the scintillating form of De Bruyne and Álvarez, will have Pep Guardiola excited as Man City – still with a game in hand – trail Jürgen Klopp’s Reds by five points at the Premier League summit. As for the hosts, Ivan Toney’s return from an eight-month gambling ban could not have gone much better after the striker scored against both Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, although Brentford lost their MD 22 clash at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Toney has scored 14 goals in his last 22 Premier League games, netting in consecutive appearances in the competition for the first time since a run of four ending in January 2023. Neal Maupay was also on the scoresheet, edging Brentford ahead on Wednesday before Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Richarlison sent Spurs roaring back into a lead that could not be overturned despite Toney’s second-half finish. While the Bees continue to fire up front, Thomas Frank’s men have lost eight of their last 10 in the competition (W2) and haven’t kept a clean sheet in any of their last 11 Premier League games as they start to look at the wrong end of the league table. Brentford fell to 15th after the Spurs defeat heading into Matchday 23, just four points clear of the relegation zone and 18th-placed Everton. Those struggles can be apportioned to two things: injuries and no Premier League side dropping more points than the Bees’ 23 from winning positions this term – as many such points as they’d lost in their previous two campaigns in the competition combined (eight in 2021-22, 15 last season). Loanee Sergio Reguilón may return to Frank’s lineup after being unable to face his parent club Tottenham, though Yoane Wissa, Frank Onyeka and Saman Ghoddos are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, while key players Bryan Mbeumo and Rico Henry remain out injured. Frank could at least welcome back Aaron Hickey and Kevin Schade for Monday’s late kick-off, albeit with the attacking burden still likely to fall on Toney, who has scored in each of his last four Premier League home games. He last netted in five consecutive home league games between January and March 2020 with Peterborough United. Brentford did the Premier League double over Man City last season, beating them 2-1 away and 1-0 at home. The last team to win three in a row against Guardiola’s side was Liverpool (four between March 2015 and December 2016). In fact, Brentford could etch their name onto an unlikely record here – Guardiola has never lost three consecutive top-flight meetings against an opponent before, something the Bees could achieve on Monday night. There seems to be a strange stranglehold Brentford have over the blue side of Manchester, with Haaland also failing to score against the Bees – he has scored against all the other 20 Premier League sides he has faced. Among players to appear against at least three teams, only former Tottenham star Harry Kane has scored against every opponent he’s competed with (32/32). This clash was initially scheduled for 23 December but moved for City’s FIFA Club World Cup commitments, meaning the 1-0 home win for Brentford last May was the most recent occasion these two teams met. While Brentford and Man City appear to be on opposite trajectories in recent weeks, this promises to be an entertaining game, considering none of the Bees’ last eight league games at the Gtech Community Stadium have finished level (W4 L4). Frank’s side have also kept just one clean sheet in 11 home top-flight outings this term – a 3-0 win over Burnley – but have also only failed to score once so far (in a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal). City have lost two of their last four Premier League away games against London sides – losing to Arsenal this term and Brentford last campaign – as many as they had in their previous 16 trips to the capital (W12 D2). However, Guardiola’s reigning English champions have won their last three Premier League away games overall despite having trailed in each of them – against Newcastle, Everton and Luton Town. Only Manchester United have ever won four consecutive away games despite falling behind in them all in the competition, doing so in six in a row between September and December 2020. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer views this as the most one-sided MD 23 clash in the Premier League, where Man City win a massive 57.2% of 10,000 pre-match simulations. Brentford only triumph in 18% despite doing the double over City last term, while the draw appears more likely in 24.8% of data-backed predictions. Manchester City (54.1%) remain the favourites to win the title in Opta’s end-of-season simulations, ahead of Liverpool (42%). Brentford’s most likely league-table finish is 14th – one above their current position – but they still have a slim 5.4% chance of relegation. Enjoy this?

Could it be, much like the title race, up in the air? When Arsenal face Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, anything could happen. With both embroiled in a fascinating Premier League title race alongside Manchester City, Tottenham and (possibly) Aston Villa, victory for either could be a huge boon to their hopes of lifting the famous crown-topped trophy come the season’s end. Sunday’s game is a very tough one to call, though. The Opta supercomputer has even struggled to separate them, giving both an equal 35.9% chance of victory. When they met in the FA Cup third round just four weeks ago it was Jürgen Klopp’s men who ran out 2-0 victors, but plenty felt Arsenal had been somewhat unlucky having had the better of the chances, particularly in the first half. Minor details could very well make the difference again, and one area the hosts will feel they have superiority is in the air. Especially in the Liverpool penalty area. Arsenal have scored 11 headed goals in the Premier League this season, two more than any other team (Nottingham Forest and Luton Town – both nine). Of those, Gabriel Magalhães has scored three, one of which came against Liverpool in the reverse fixture in December (also two vs Crystal Palace). Other Arsenal players to find the net in the league via their head this season are Gabriel Jesus (two – one vs Luton, one vs Brighton), Bukayo Saka (vs Bournemouth), Ben White (vs Bournemouth), William Saliba (vs Burnley), Leandro Trossard (vs Burnley), Kai Havertz (vs Brentford) and Declan Rice (vs Luton). No team has been as ruthless with their headed chances on target as Arsenal, with 11 of their 18 finding the net (61.1%). Forest (9 of 18), Spurs (7 of 14) and Villa (5 of 10) all average 50% of their headed shots on target going in. Four of Arsenal’s headed goals have been from corners, which is hardly surprising considering where the majority of them end up. Due to their preference for inswingers – 144 out of their 145 crossed corners in the Premier League this season have been swung in – if an Arsenal player makes the first contact from an attacking corner, they will likely have a good chance of scoring as they’ll be fairly close to goal.  You can see from the aerial duel map below how many of their headers in the opposition box are close to goal, not just from corners but also from set-pieces and open-play crosses. Compare that to Liverpool, who are generally better in the air than Arsenal – winning 57.2% of aerial duels across the pitch compared to Arteta’s men winning 48.8% – but when they contest balls in the opposition’s area, they mostly do so further away from goal. Not all of these will be from corners, but for comparison, just 48 of Liverpool’s 134 crossed corners in the league have been inswingers (85 outswingers). They have scored four goals from corners in the Premier League in 2023-24, but none have been headers. Liverpool overpowered Chelsea on Wednesday night in a performance that will have made anyone doubting their title credentials sit up and take notice. When Dominik Szoboszlai put them 3-0 up as he headed home a cross from the sublime Conor Bradley, it was a significant moment. Not just because it somewhat cemented the outcome of the game, but it also doubled Liverpool’s headed goal tally in the Premier League for the season. Remarkably, it was just their second goal via a header in their 22 league games in 2023-24, after Mohamed Salah scored against Brentford in November. For anyone asking: “What about Luis Díaz’s goal at Luton?”, that didn’t count as a header as it actually came off the Colombian’s shoulder. Only Sheffield United, Burnley and Crystal Palace (all one) have scored fewer than Liverpool’s two headers in the Premier League this season, but it has not been for a lack of trying by Klopp’s side. Only Luton (57), West Ham (55) and Everton (54) have attempted more headed shots (excluding blocks) than Liverpool’s 53. Arsenal have only attempted 49, though have hit the target with 18, whereas their opponents on Sunday have tested the opposition goalkeeper just 13 times. That said, Liverpool have only conceded four headed goals this season in the Premier League. Just six teams (including Arsenal – three) have conceded fewer. That’s also not to say Liverpool can’t hurt Arsenal using their noggins. They may have only scored one headed goal in the league prior to Wednesday, and just three in all competitions before last weekend, but that total has more than doubled in the last week. Three of Liverpool’s five goals against Norwich City in the FA Cup fourth round last Sunday were headers (Curtis Jones, Virgil van Dijk and Ryan Gravenberch), while, as mentioned, Szoboszlai added another against Chelsea in midweek. That makes it four headed goals in the two games since Klopp announced that he is leaving at the end of the season. It somewhat feels like that scene from The Simpsons where the music teacher leaves the classroom and the school band play “the forbidden music” of Pop Goes the Weasel. We jest, of course. Klopp clearly hasn’t been telling his players not to score headed goals, but just imagine how many they would have scored overall if they’d been more ruthless in the air. Liverpool may not have bothered the net with many headers so far, but they have scored the joint-most goals overall in the Premier League this season (51) along with Manchester City. Of course, this means Liverpool are far deadlier with their feet. They have scored 25 right-footed goals in the Premier League compared to Arsenal’s 19, and 20 left-footed goals to the Gunners’ 13. You can see from the graphics below how much more effective Arsenal have been when it comes to headers on target. Finding the corners more often has been key, while Liverpool’s have predominantly been quite central and close to the goalkeeper. Another curious thing about these contrasting numbers is how they compare to recent seasons. It certainly doesn’t follow any trend as far as Liverpool are concerned. In full seasons since Klopp arrived at Anfield in 2015, his team haven’t scored fewer than 12 headed goals in a league campaign, so would need to score another 10 in their final 16 games this season just to match their lowest return in that time. In fact, they scored 18 in the 2018-19 season and 19 the following campaign when they won the league. Just last season, which was largely one to forget for Liverpool, they recorded 13 headed Premier League goals, one more than Arsenal’s 12. In 2021-22, only seven teams scored fewer than Arsenal’s seven headed goals in the Premier League, while the season before that only four teams scored fewer than their six. It is clearly an area Arteta has targeted for improvement in the last year or two, and so far, it has been working. Will it be a difference maker on Sunday? Time will tell, but if these numbers give any indication then expect Liverpool to be doing everything in their power to keep the ball on the floor as much as possible. Yes, it does feel strange saying that about an opponent of Arsenal, but here we are. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Who will come out on top? We look ahead to the game with our Arsenal vs Liverpool prediction and preview. Sunday’s Premier League action is headlined by a titanic clash of title rivals at the Emirates Stadium, with Arsenal desperate to strike back at leaders Liverpool, who take a five-point lead to north London. With Manchester City also in ominous form, any slip-ups could prove pivotal.  We look to have a three-horse race on our hands after the Premier League’s midweek fixtures, with Liverpool, City and Arsenal all winning while Aston Villa suffered a dire 3-1 defeat to Newcastle United. In the latest edition of the Opta supercomputer’s season predictions, City are still title favourites, finishing top of the pile in 54.4% of scenarios, but Jürgen Klopp’s hopes of a farewell success are up to 42.1%, rising by 5.5% after Liverpool’s 4-1 rout of Chelsea. Arsenal are given just a 3.3% chance of finishing as champions, though a victory on Sunday would provide a major boost to their hopes. Arsenal made it back-to-back victories with their 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka on target, the latter reaching double figures for both goals and assists in all competitions in 2023-24. He has now achieved that feat in back-to-back seasons, becoming the first Arsenal player to do so since Alexis Sánchez (three straight between 2014-15 and 2016-17). Mikel Arteta’s men have responded well to a poor run that saw them go three league games without a win across the festive period, a sequence that began with a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture at Anfield on 23 December. Gabriel Magalhães put Arsenal ahead four minutes into that contest, only for Mohamed Salah to score Liverpool’s equaliser, and the Gunners were also extremely fortunate not to concede a penalty when skipper Martin Ødegaard appeared to handle the ball inside his own area. Arsenal have made a habit of starting well against Liverpool, opening the scoring in the first 10 minutes of their last three league meetings with the Reds, though they have only won one of those matches (two draws). They last scored first in four straight league games against Liverpool between August 1967 and November 1970 (a run of six). Gabriel Martinelli was responsible for the opening goal in two of those games, and he has more goal contributions versus Liverpool (six – four goals, two assists) than against any other team since arriving at Arsenal in 2019. Arteta has no new injury concerns ahead of the game, and he could even have Fábio Vieira and Mohamed Elneny available, with the latter unable to prevent Egypt’s Africa Cup of Nations exit last Sunday. The Gunners boss does have a decision to make in midfield, having selected Emile Smith Rowe ahead of Kai Havertz and Jorginho in midweek. If anyone thought the news of Klopp’s impending exit would prove a distraction for Liverpool, they banished that notion with Wednesday’s crushing win over Chelsea as Diogo Jota, Conor Bradley, Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Díaz all scored for the rampant Reds. The scoreline could have been even more comprehensive had Darwin Núñez not become the first player on record (since 2003-04) to hit the woodwork four times in a single Premier League match. Wednesday’s game was also a notable one for 20-year-old right-back Bradley, who scored his first Liverpool goal as well as recording two assists. He will likely be replaced by the fit-again Trent Alexander-Arnold on Sunday, however, with the England international having assisted six goals in his last seven league games against Arsenal. Throughout Premier League history, only Steven Gerrard has matched Alexander-Arnold’s overall tally of seven assists against the Gunners. 2 – In the history of the Premier League, only two defenders aged under 21 have been directly involved in 3+ goals in a game:Trent Alexander-Arnold, Feb 2019 (v Watford)Conor Bradley, Jan 2024 (v Chelsea)Production. pic.twitter.com/aCxbLR0uSh He’s not the only Liverpool player with a particular appetite for facing Arsenal. Jota has five goals and two assists in his five appearances for the Reds at the Emirates across all competitions, averaging a goal involvement every 41 minutes in those matches. Since Jota joined Liverpool in 2020, teammate Salah is the only Premier League player with more goals at a single away ground, netting seven times against Manchester United at Old Trafford during that time. Salah will again be absent on Sunday after sustaining a hamstring injury at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Wataru Endō is still at the Asian Cup with Japan. Alexis Mac Allister should be able to shake off the knock he suffered against Chelsea, while Andy Robertson is pushing for a start after being eased back into action from the bench recently.\\xa0 Sunday’s game comes less than a month after the most recent meeting between the teams, with Liverpool having beaten Arsenal 2-0 in the FA Cup on 7 January. The Gunners missed several early chances in that game, but a Jakub Kiwior own goal and a powerful Díaz finish condemned them to a third-round exit. There have been five previous instances of a team winning two away games against Arsenal in the same season, with Liverpool doing so in 2021-22. The other sides to do so are Nottingham Forest (1987-88), Aston Villa (1993-94), Man City (2020-21) and Brighton and Hove Albion (2022-23). In the Premier League, however, Arsenal have taken five points from their last three games against Liverpool (one win, two draws), as many as in their previous 12 (one win, two draws, nine losses). They are looking to remain unbeaten in four straight league matches against the Reds for the first time since Arsène Wenger’s team did so between December 2014 and January 2016 (one win, three draws). However, Liverpool have scored in 16 successive league games against Arsenal, last being shut out by the Gunners in a goalless draw in August 2015. Overall, they have scored 108 Premier League goals versus the Gunners, making them the only side to reach a century against them in the competition.\\xa0\\xa0 Sunday’s match will be a landmark occasion, marking the 200th league meeting between the two giants. It will become just the fifth fixture to be played 200 times in English league history, with Liverpool currently boasting 79 wins to Arsenal’s 66 (54 draws). Liverpool have won their last four away games in the Premier League, beating Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Bournemouth, scoring 10 goals and only conceding one. Klopp’s men only won five of their previous 15 games on the road prior to this run, drawing seven and losing three. Arsenal, meanwhile, have won six of their last seven league matches at the Emirates, the exception being a 2-0 defeat to West Ham on 28 December. Only Liverpool (29) and Aston Villa (28) have bettered the Gunners’ return of 26 points at home in the Premier League this season.

We look ahead to their next game on Sunday with our Manchester United vs West Ham prediction and preview. For all their troubles, Manchester United have not lost their knack for pulling results out of the fire. For just under two minutes on Thursday, it looked as though the pressure on Erik ten Hag would be ratcheted up as Wolves fought back from 3-1 down to level a thrilling contest at 3-3 in second-hald stoppage time. However, Kobbie Mainoo stepped up with a brilliant, curling effort in the 97th minute to bail the Dutchman out, and leave United looking up ahead of Sunday’s meeting with West Ham. Four of the last five 90th-minute Premier League winners to be scored by players aged 18 or younger have now been for United; Federico Macheda vs Aston Villa in 2009, Marcus Rashford vs Hull City in 2016, Alejandro Garnacho vs Fulham in 2022 and Mainoo at Molineux on Thursday night. In truth, United should have been out of sight long before Wolves mounted their rousing fightback, having two goals disallowed and missing plenty of chances to add to early strikes from Rashford and Rasmus Højlund before Scott McTominay got their third goal off the bench in the second half. Rashford’s opener felt particularly significant, coming at the end of a week which had seen the forward disciplined by United after being seen in a nightclub in Belfast shortly before he missed training. The England man’s form has attracted criticism for much of the season, but perhaps he has begun to turn a corner. Rashford has either scored (three goals) or assisted (one) in each of his last four Premier League appearances, his best run of games with a goal involvement in the competition since a five-match streak between January and February 2023. Højlund, meanwhile, now has six goal involvements in his last five appearances for United across all competitions (four goals, two assists), and he is beginning to feel comfortable at Old Trafford. The Dane has been involved in three goals in his last two home games (two goals, one assist), having only scored twice (no assists) in his first 12 Old Trafford outings. Ten Hag still has problems elsewhere, though, with United having now conceded 52 goals across all competitions this term. They are just the second Premier League side to ship a half-century in 2023-24 after Sheffield United (59), and this is the fewest number of games into a season (32) that United have conceded 50 goals in all competitions since 1977-78, when they did so within 31 matches. United were finally able to field something resembling their strongest lineup on Thursday, with the returns of André Onana, Lisandro Martínez, Luke Shaw and Casemiro boosting Ten Hag’s options in recent weeks. Sofyan Amrabat is available for Sunday after Morocco’s Africa Cup of Nations exit, but Mason Mount and Anthony Martial are still sidelined. Thursday’s victory took United within one point of sixth-placed West Ham, who fought back for a 1-1 draw at home to Bournemouth with James Ward-Prowse rescuing a point for the Hammers by converting a penalty won by Mohammed Kudus. West Ham had fallen behind within three minutes as loanee Kalvin Phillips teed up Dominic Solanke for an easy finish with a misplaced pass on his debut. In fact, needed just two touches of the ball in a Hammers shirt to commit an error leading to a goal, having only previously committed one in 65 Premier League games for Leeds United and Manchester City. That ultimately cost David Moyes’ men two points, though they are now unbeaten in six league games, their longest streak since September 2021 (seven), even if their last three have finished level. They have tended to fare well on the road this season, taking 17 points from their 11 away league games (five wins, two draws, four defeats), which is already five more than they collected on their travels in 2022-23 (three wins, three draws, 13 defeats). One player who particularly thrives away from the London Stadium is Jarrod Bowen, who has scored seven away goals for West Ham in the Premier League this campaign. The last Hammers player to net more on the road in a single top-flight season was Mike Small, who hit nine in 1991-92. How Moyes would love to enjoy a memorable away day against the club that sacked him after just nine months in charge in 2013-14. The former Red Devils boss has only won one of his 19 away games against them across all competitions (four draws, 14 losses), leading West Ham to a 1-0 EFL Cup win in September 2021. In the Premier League, he’s lost on 12 of his last 16 visits (four draws). Moyes will again be unable to call upon injured duo Michail Antonio and Lucas Paquetá, while Saïd Benrahma – who saw a deadline-day move to Lyon collapse in dramatic fashion – is still suspended, but Vladimír Coufal is eligible after serving his own one-match ban. West Ham have a dismal record at Old Trafford, where Man United are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League games against the Irons (12 wins, three draws). However, Moyes’ side did manage a 2-0 win in December’s reverse fixture at the London Stadium, with Bowen and Kudus on target. They could now complete their first league double over United since 2006-07, when they won 1-0 at Old Trafford on the final day of the season to secure survival with Carlos Tevez scoring the goal. That remains their most recent league victory at Old Trafford, where United have won their last three meetings with the Irons by a 1-0 scoreline. The last team to win four consecutive home Premier League games against an opponent by the same scoreline was Sunderland against Manchester City, winning 1-0 four times in a row at the Stadium of Light between 2010 and 2013. United have taken 10 points from their last five home league games (three wins, one draw, one defeat), having lost three of their previous four at Old Trafford (one win). However, they have conceded seven goals in their last three home league matches, losing 3-0 to Bournemouth, beating Aston Villa 3-2 and drawing 2-2 with Tottenham. They have not conceded multiple goals in four successive home league games since doing so between November 1971 and January 1972. While West Ham’s last league defeat came in early December at Fulham (0-5), they are actually winless in their last five matches across all competitions, drawing four and losing an FA Cup third-round replay at Bristol City.

Ahead of kick-off on Sunday at Old Trafford, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: Following their midweek heroics, the Opta supercomputer makes Manchester United favourites to build some momentum with a home win. Of 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of kick-off, Man Utd won 45.8%, with West Ham triumphing in 26.4% and the remaining 27.8% finishing level. In the Opta supercomputer’s season predictions, Manchester United and West Ham are deemed likely to be in direct competition for European qualification. The Red Devils are given a 42.7% chance of a top-seven finish to West Ham’s 54.5%, though a home win on Sunday may flip those probabilities. Enjoy this?

Goals are the best thing about football, unless they’re going in your goal. Being in the Premier League is a dream for many, but it turned into a nightmare for some teams who just couldn’t stop opposition teams from scoring past them. With Sheffield United threatening to join the list in the 2023-24 campaign, we run down those who have conceded the most goals in a Premier League season since the competition began in 1992. The list will look at the highest overall totals, though it must be noted the first two teams on this list played in Premier League seasons with 42 games for each team, rather than the 38 we have now.  In just the second year of the Premier League, Swindon made a brief appearance in England’s top flight. It had its moments, with wins over Southampton, Tottenham and Coventry and they even did the double over Queens Park Rangers. However, John Gorman’s side also struggled to keep clean sheets, with just four in their 42 games. Within their first four games of the season, they had conceded five against both Liverpool and Southampton. Their back-to-back wins against Spurs and Coventry came sandwiched between conceding six at Everton and five at Aston Villa. A 7-1 defeat at Newcastle United in March was the most they conceded in one game, but an insipid farewell outing on the final day also saw them reach three figures for goals conceded, with a 5-0 loss at home to Leeds United taking it to a nice round century.  Swindon remain the only team ever to have shipped 100 goals in a Premier League season. * 42-game season 1994-95 saw Ipswich Town concede the second-most goals in a Premier League season (93), but their fans will no doubt be keen for us to point out that it’s only fourth-most in terms of goals per game. The Tractor Boys only kept three clean sheets in their 42 games, but only once did they concede more than four goals in a game. That came in their famous 9-0 defeat at Manchester United, which remains tied as the biggest margin of victory in Premier League history. Unsurprisingly, as happened with Swindon, Ipswich finished bottom. * 42-game season It remains the worst Premier League campaign of all time, with Derby amassing just 11 points in the 2007-08 season. In terms of goals per game, it is also the second-worst in the league’s history. It was an ominous start for Paul Jewell’s men, losing 4-0 at Tottenham, 6-0 at Liverpool and 5-0 at Arsenal in their first seven games. Things didn’t really get better at any point, with Derby keeping just one clean sheet in their final 28 games. Their last 10 games included a 6-1 loss at Chelsea, a 6-0 home defeat to Aston Villa and a 6-2 home loss against Arsenal. They appropriately ended the season by losing 4-0 at Pride Park to Reading. The first team in this list not to finish bottom of the league, though that presumably wasn’t much consolation for Fulham as 19th place still gets you relegated. 2013-14 was a campaign that saw three managers give it a go, but none of Martin Jol, René Meulensteen or Felix Magath could stop Fulham from conceding goals. It was more a steady stream of goals than regular thrashings, though their biggest margin of defeat was a 6-0 loss at Hull City in late December. They conceded four against both Everton and Manchester City just before Christmas, with City putting another five past them in the reverse fixture. Both Cardiff City (692) and West Ham (677) actually faced more shots than Fulham (671) in total that season, but only conceded 74 and 51 goals respectively. One of the Premier League’s most notorious ‘yo-yo’ clubs, Norwich were promoted back to the Premier League after a very strong 2020-21 season in which they won the Championship with 97 points, conceding just 36 goals in their 46 games. Expectations were high that they could finally establish themselves in the Premier League, but things frankly could not have started worse. They lost 3-0 to Liverpool and 5-0 to Manchester City in their first two admittedly difficult games, before shipping seven away to Chelsea in late October. After Dean Smith replaced Daniel Farke they still struggled to pick up points but did at least seem to stop the heavy defeats, though a 5-0 loss at home to Arsenal on Boxing Day suggested a turnaround in form wasn’t imminent. Another 5-0 home defeat to Tottenham on the final day was an appropriate way to sign off their latest brief Premier League visit. Their expected goals (xG) against total of 77.4 was 8.4 more than the next worst team (Leeds – 69.0). Like Swindon, it was one and done for Barnsley in the Premier League, though the Tykes weren’t quite as leaky at the back as the Wiltshire side. A 1-0 win away at Crystal Palace in their second game suggested Barnsley might be a tougher prospect than many anticipated, though a 6-0 home defeat to Chelsea in their next outing indicated otherwise. There was also a 5-0 loss at Arsenal, a 7-0 hammering at Manchester United and a 6-0 thrashing at West Ham to follow. Barnsley managed to avoid finishing bottom, though, with their 35 points enough to finish ahead of Crystal Palace, but relegation was still the end result. When Robbie Blake slammed in the winner for Burnley in a 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Turf Moor, Clarets fans must have been very excited about what their first Premier League campaign would bring. Despite another 1-0 win against Everton in their next game, the 2009-10 season mostly brought goals against and ultimately, relegation. Trips to Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs saw a combined 12 goals go past them, while they also conceded five in away games against West Ham and Aston Villa. Burnley had been relatively solid at home, until 6-0 and 4-0 defeats respectively against Man City and Liverpool in the last two months of the season. They finished with 30 points and were relegated in 18th. Wolves had avoided relegation by a single point in the 2010-11 season, but it turned out they were just delaying the inevitable as Mick McCarthy and then Terry Connor were unable to keep the wolf from the door. It started well enough, with Wolves conceding just once in their first three games, but from the end of August to the middle of the following April, they didn’t keep another clean sheet in the Premier League. A 4-1 loss at Manchester United was the only time they conceded more than three in a game until an embarrassing 5-1 home defeat to rivals West Brom, which spelled the end of McCarthy’s reign. Connor oversaw 5-0 defeats away at Fulham and at home to Man Utd, and in reality, Wolves never looked like repeating their achievement of staying up as they finished with just 25 points, 12 off safety.

We look ahead to the encounter with our Everton vs Tottenham prediction and preview. Sean Dyche must find a way for Everton to arrest their winless Premier League run, already contending with a 10-point deduction and returning to the relegation zone ahead of Saturday’s early kick-off against Tottenham at Goodison Park. A breach of the Premier League’s financial and sustainability rulings, which has been appealed by the club, had Everton reeling before four straight top-flight wins – against Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Burnley – somewhat eased the growing concern of Championship football next season in the blue half of Merseyside. However, Dyche’s men have since suffered a five-game winless run in the competition, losing to Spurs, Manchester City and Wolves before back-to-back goalless draws with Aston Villa and Fulham. A point in the 0-0 draw against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Matchday 22 should not be frowned upon for the Toffees, where goalkeeper Jordan Pickford kept yet another clean sheet. The England number one has now kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League this season (eight), with six of those coming in his last nine league matches. Ashley Young made an encouraging return from injury against Fulham on Tuesday, though Dyche will likely remain without Amadou Onana, André Gomes, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Dele Alli, Idrissa Gueye and Séamus Coleman as Everton’s midfield continues to be depleted. Doucouré will be the main miss for the home side, having scored three goals in his last six Premier League appearances at Goodison Park, as many as in his first 47 games on home soil for the Toffees. As for the visitors, Spurs continued their top-four push with a comeback 3-2 victory at home to Brentford on Wednesday. Neal Maupay opened the scoring, infuriating James Maddison after imitating his celebration, before Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Richarlison scored second-half goals in a blistering response at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Some nerves still remained on MD 22 in north London as Ivan Toney’s strike – set up by a comical Udogie error – teed up a nervy ending, although Postecoglou’s men held on for a victory that moved them up to fourth in the league table after edging ahead of Villa on goal difference. Spurs also sit just three points behind Arsenal and Manchester City, though the latter have a game in hand as that pair trail league-leading Liverpool by five. Maddison, if slightly aggrieved with Maupay’s opening-goal mockery, returned to fitness for the Brentford win after a three-month long absence, though Postecoglou’s lineup on Saturday will remain without a few familiar faces. Son Heung-min and Yves Bissouma are at the Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively, while Manor Solomon, Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon remain out – though Pape Sarr could return after Senegal’s AFCON elimination. That lengthy list of absentees has offered Richarlison a chance to step up, however. The Brazilian has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League games, more than three times as many as he netted in his first 39 matches in the competition for Tottenham (two). Timo Werner has also slotted in well since his loan from RB Leipzig, becoming just the second player to provide an assist in each of his first two Premier League appearances for Spurs, after Serhiy Rebrov in August 2000. The Brazilian striker will also fancy his chances at Goodison, aiming to become the first player to score home and away against Everton in a single Premier League campaign having previously played for the Merseyside club. Richarlison has scored in two of his last three away league games, having scored in just one of his first 21 on the road for Spurs. Tottenham have won more Premier League games against Everton (30) than they have against any other club, while they’ve also scored more goals against the Toffees (100) than they have against any other side in the competition. Indeed, Everton have won just one of their last 22 Premier League games against Spurs (D10 L11) and are winless in six against them since a 1-0 victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on MD1 in 2020-21. As for recent times at Goodison, there should be no fear for the visitors, who are unbeaten in each of their last 10 trips to the blue half of Merseyside in the Premier League (W3 D7), with each of their last four visits ending level. That four-game run of draws would do neither side any favours with a continuation here, though Everton have only drawn five consecutive home league matches against Bury (1912-1928) and Leicester City (1994-2000). The last meeting between Everton and Spurs came two days before Christmas, with Spurs racing into a two-goal lead inside 18 minutes thanks to strikes from Richarlison and Son. Andre Gomes scored in the 82nd minute to make it a tense finish in a game that Everton would have felt aggrieved not to have won at least a point in. No away side have managed to produce as many shots on target in a Premier League game at Spurs this season than Everton did that day (8). Everton have lost just two of their last seven home Premier League games (W3 D2) – against Manchester City and Manchester United – while Dyche’s side have also kept three clean sheets in their last four league matches on home soil. Those three shutouts came against Aston Villa, Chelsea and Newcastle United, though Everton have won just two of their last 13 Premier League games kicking off at 12:30pm on a Saturday (D5 L6), while they are winless in such fixtures this term (2-2 vs Sheffield United in September and a 2-0 loss at Liverpool in October). However, Spurs have won just one of their last five away Premier League games (D2 L2), with that victory coming at Nottingham Forest in December – and their record in this kick-off time is poor, too. Having won their first two Premier League games kicking off at 12:30pm on a Saturday this season (against Bournemouth and Luton), Spurs lost their last such game away to Wolves in November. In fact, none of Tottenham’s last 12 Premier League games kicking off in this timeslot on a Saturday have finished level (W5 L7). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer predicts an away win at Goodison Park, with Tottenham triumphing in 45.2% of 10,000 pre-match simulations, compared to an Everton victory in 26.6%. A draw is more likely than a victory for Dyche’s side, with that result predicted in 28.2% of data-led forecasts, although that would damage Everton’s survival hopes. At the time of writing, Everton’s relegation chances rank at 21.5%, though Luton Town (36.3%), Nottingham Forest (33.1%), Burnley (95.3%) and Sheffield United (99%) all have a greater chance of going down. Meanwhile, Tottenham’s top-four chances rank at 48.7% in the same Opta end-of-season predictions. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Here, we look ahead to Saturday’s Premier League clash with our Brighton vs Crystal Palace prediction and preview. Reports linking Roberto De Zerbi with managerial positions at Liverpool and Barcelona were indicators of a job generally well done by the Italian at Brighton. But, a few days can be a long time in football, and a brutal midweek defeat to Luton Town brought the Seagulls and their boss back to earth. Saturday’s clash with bitter rivals Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium is the perfect opportunity for a response. Liverpool boss Jürgen Klopp and Barcelona head coach Xavi are set to leave at the end of the 2023-24 season, with reports suggesting De Zerbi could be a contender to replace either, but not based on Brighton’s showing in Tuesday’s 4-0 humiliation at Luton. The visitors were 2-0 down inside three minutes at Kenilworth Road on Matchday 22 and 3-0 behind at the interval – of the five times Brighton have been three goals adrift at half-time in a Premier League game, three have been under De Zerbi, also doing so against Everton in May 2023 and Aston Villa last September. That crushing Luton defeat left Brighton eighth in the league table after failing to score for a third-straight Premier League outing in 2023, only going on a longer such run in the competition between March and April 2019 under Chris Hughton (six games). In fact, that goalless run comes after scoring in all but one of 35 league matches between March and December 2023 – the last team to fail to score in their first four games in a calendar year was Leicester City in 2017. De Zerbi hooked Pervis Estupiñán at half-time at Luton, while James Milner limped off after just 20 minutes as Brighton’s injury issues continued. Joël Veltman, Ansu Fati, Julio Enciso and Solly March all remain as long-term absentees, with Japan’s Kaoru Mitoma and Ivory Coast’s Simon Adingra at the Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively. As for Saturday’s visitors, Luton’s dominant win would’ve dragged Palace into the relegation mix if not for their 3-2 comeback victory over Sheffield United at Selhurst Park. Eberechi Eze twice levelled after goals from Ben Brereton Diaz and James McAtee before Michael Olise crashed in his second-half winner. Olise teed up both of Eze’s first-half finishes, setting up his attacking partner for the seventh time in the Premier League overall, the joint-most one Palace player has assisted a single teammate in the competition, along with Andros Townsend for Christian Benteke and James McArthur for Wilfried Zaha. Unsurprisingly, Manchester United and Chelsea are reportedly long-term admirers of Olise, who also became the first Palace player to register three goal involvements in more than one Premier League game (one goal, two assists against Sheffield United), previously doing so against Leeds United in April 2023 (three assists). Tuesday’s victory over the Blades may have somewhat eased the pressure on Palace manager Roy Hodgson, too, with his 14th-place side sitting six points clear of Everton in the relegation zone heading into MD 23. However, there may still be some concern for Hodgson as Olise and Eze were withdrawn against the Blades, with the latter suffering what his manager described as an “unfortunate” hamstring issue. Hodgson will hope his star duo are in contention for Saturday, adding “with any luck” they will both be fit, and apart from that has far fewer injury concerns to worry about than De Zerbi. Joel Ward, Rob Holding and Cheick Doucouré are the only others missing from Palace’s squad ahead of the south-coast kick-off, while new arrivals Daniel Muñoz and Adam Wharton could feature. Meanwhile, the in-form Olise could hit another landmark. He has been directly involved in at least one goal in each of his last five Premier League appearances for Palace (five goals, three assists) and could become the first Eagles player to score or assist in six consecutive appearances in the competition should he do so against Brighton. Having won this exact fixture 1-0 last season thanks to March’s goal, Brighton are looking to win consecutive home league games against Palace for the first time since a run of seven between 1979 and 1988. In fact, Palace have failed to win any of their last five Premier League games against the Seagulls since a 2-1 away win in February 2021 (D4 L1), as Jean-Philippe Mateta and the now-departed Christian Benteke were on target. Expect goals on Saturday, too. While the first Premier League meeting between Brighton and Crystal Palace finished 0-0, since then both teams have scored in 10 of their 12 encounters (one clean sheet each). De Zerbi’s side have scored exactly once in each of the last seven meetings but haven’t netted more than once in any of the last nine. These two rivals could not be separated earlier in the season either, with Danny Welbeck’s late goal cancelling out Jordan Ayew’s opener at Selhurst Park in a 1-1 draw on 21 December. Brighton may be winless in their last five Premier League away matches – their longest streak since a seven-game run under Graham Potter ended in December 2021 – but their home form is far more encouraging. The Seagulls are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League games at the Amex (W4 D5) since a 3-1 loss to West Ham in August. It’s their longest streak without a home league defeat since a run of 14 between September 2016 and February 2017, and their longest ever in the top flight. However, Palace have won two of their last three Premier League matches (L1) – beating Brentford and Sheffield United either side of a 5-0 hammering by Arsenal – as many as in their previous 15 league games combined (W2 D5 L8). Keeping a clean sheet would be a good start on Saturday for Palace. All three of their Premier League away wins this season have been to nil (against Burnley, Manchester United and Sheffield United). They have only won one of their last 19 away league games when conceding (D5 L13), though, beating Leeds 5-1 in April 2023. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides: Despite the heavy away defeat at Luton, Brighton are backed to defeat Palace by the Opta supercomputer after the home side won in 47.4% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations. Palace’s chance of victory is ranked lower than the draw, with an away triumph forecast in 24.5% of scenarios compared to the spoils shared 28.1% of the time. In Opta’s season predictions, Brighton remain in their current league-table position by finishing eighth (18.5%), while Palace stay 14th in 19.4% but still have a 5.1% chance of an unlikely relegation.

We look ahead to the game with our Sheffield United vs Aston Villa prediction and preview. Saturday’s late kick-off in the Premier League features two sides with very different ambitions in Sheffield United and Aston Villa, but both will be desperate to bounce back following dispiriting midweek defeats. Sheffield United are running out of time if they are to mount any sort of push to preserve their top-flight status, with the Opta supercomputer giving them just a 1.0% chance of avoiding the drop following Tuesday’s 3-2 defeat at Crystal Palace, as Luton Town’s incredible 4-0 rout of Brighton and Hove Albion left the Blades nine points adrift of safety. Chris Wilder’s men twice took the lead at Selhurst Park through Ben Brereton Díaz and James McAtee, but Palace’s quality eventually told as three terrific finishes – two from Eberechi Eze and one from Michael Olise – propelled them to victory. Sheffield United’s tally of just 10 points from 22 Premier League games is their second-worst at this stage of a season in English football’s top four tiers, only collecting fewer in 1975-76 when they had six points from their first 22 matches and went on to finish bottom of the top flight. In the Premier League era, only three teams have previously accumulated 10 points or fewer after 22 games, and they all went on to finish bottom: Bolton Wanderers in 1995-96 (10), Sunderland in 2005-06 (9) and Derby County in 2007-08 (7). The Blades’ performances have picked up since Wilder returned to the club in December, but their results are yet to catch up. Indeed, across Wilder’s first 35 games as a Premier League manager, his Sheffield United side earned 54 points (W14 D12 L9). In his last 39, they have earned just 19 points (W5 D4 L30), shipping 66 goals and only netting 25. Oli McBurnie has done his best to improve their attacking output, scoring in each of his last four league games at Bramall Lane, but Sheffield United have not won any of those matches (one draw, three losses). The last Blades player to score in five consecutive home league games was David McGoldrick in 2018-19, but no player has ever achieved that feat for the club in the Premier League. McBurnie should lead the line again on Saturday, with Rhian Brewster still suspended following his red card in the 2-2 draw against West Ham. Tom Davies is close to returning after three months out with a knee injury, but Wilder may be forced into a change of goalkeeper after new arrival Ivo Grbić suffered a suspected concussion on Tuesday, putting Wes Foderingham in line to start. Villa, meanwhile, lost ground on their rivals at the summit with a 3-1 defeat to Newcastle United on Tuesday, their first home loss in the Premier League since last February (4-2 vs Arsenal). Unai Emery’s men produced a disjointed performance, with Ollie Watkins’ second-half strike a mere consolation after Fabian Schär scored twice and Álex Moreno put through his own net. Having been tipped for a surprise title tilt, Villa may now be fretting about their hopes of UEFA Champions League qualification after enduring something of a drop-off. They have only taken five points from their last five Premier League matches (one win, two draws, two defeats), having earned 13 from their previous five (four wins, one draw). Following Tuesday’s loss, they have also conceded three goals in two of their last four league games, also doing so in a 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Boxing Day, as many times as in their previous 33 outings. They will again have to make do without two key defenders, with Saturday’s game likely to come too soon for injured duo Pau Torres and Lucas Digne. Leon Bailey is pushing for a start following a lively cameo against Newcastle.  Bailey came off the bench to assist Watkins for Villa’s goal on Tuesday, and that effort was the striker’s 50th in the Premier League. With 10 goals to date in 2023-24, Watkins has reached double figures in each of his first four top-flight seasons, becoming the first Englishman to achieve that feat since Liverpool great Robbie Fowler (1993-94 to 1996-97). These teams met just five matchdays ago as Sheffield United went agonisingly close to a shock win at Villa Park. Cameron Archer put the Blades ahead late on, only for Nicolò Zaniolo to salvage a 1-1 draw for Villa in stoppage time. Villa have lost just two of their 11 Premier League games against Sheffield United (six wins, three draws), but those defeats have come on each of their last two visits to Bramall Lane. Indeed, the Blades have won their last three home league matches against Villa since suffering a 1-0 defeat in the Championship in January 2018. Sheffield United triumphed 1-0 with 10 men when Villa last visited Bramall Lane in March 2021, holding on after Phil Jagielka’s red card as McGoldrick’s first-half strike proved decisive. Villa’s patchy away record could offer Sheffield United hope, with Emery’s men only winning two of their last seven league games on the road (three draws, two defeats). Sheffield United have collected eight of their 10 points at Bramall Lane this season, managing victories over Wolves and Brentford as well as draws with Everton and West Ham. However, only Burnley (four) have collected fewer home points in the Premier League this term. Saturday’s hosts are winless in six league games since overcoming Brentford in early December (two draws, four defeats), and they may not be able to rely on their backline to frustrate Villa. The Blades have only kept one clean sheet in Premier League action this season, the fewest of any side, while they have also shipped 54 goals this term. That is the second most ever conceded at this stage of a Premier League campaign, after Barnsley shipped 57 in 1997-98. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: Emery will demand a reaction after Villa turned in one of their worst performances of the season on Tuesday, and the Opta supercomputer expects him to get one. Across 10,000 match simulations conducted by the supercomputer, Villa triumph in 53.8%. Sheffield United are given just a 19.6% chance of victory, with 26.6% of scenarios seeing the points shared. Villa’s defeat to Newcastle saw their title hopes drop to just 0.1% after Wednesday’s fixtures, but they still secure a top-four finish in 50.2% of our season simulations.  Sheffield United, meanwhile, are now assigned a 70.2% chance of finishing bottom – no side is given a higher probability of finishing in a single position across the entire Premier League.

Here, we explain exactly why. The Africa Cup of Nations is often remarkable in one way or another. The last tournament stood out for a lack of goals, when just 100 were scored, and for Egypt coming within a spot-kick of winning the whole thing despite drawing all four of their knockout games. The 2023 edition, now at the quarter-finals, has been exceptional for several reasons. Here, we have come up with eight ahead of the last-eight stage to show just how incredible this tournament has been. The final eight teams at the 2021 tournament were Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Senegal, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Cameroon, Egypt and Morocco. This time around, not a single one of those teams remains. The final eight in 2023 are Nigeria, Angola, DR Congo, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Cape Verde and South Africa. For the turnover to be so great between two tournaments played just two years apart (AFCON 2021 was played in early 2022) is genuinely incredible. The reason this has happened in 2023 is simple… In 2021, five of Africa’s top seven teams according to the FIFA Rankings at the time made it to the last eight stage. Three of those teams were in the top 30 teams in the world, and the last eight had an average ranking of 62.1 – a number skewed massively by the presence of Equatorial Guinea (114th in the world) and Gambia (150) in the quarter-finals. Those two had thrown up a few shocks merely by getting as far as they did. Gambia beat Tunisia (30) in the group stage, for example, and Equatorial Guinea knocked out Mali (53) in the round of 16. But AFCON 2023 has been something else. The shocks have been relentless. The final eight this time includes none of the top five FIFA-ranked African teams and only one of the top seven. None of the remaining teams are in the world’s top 40 at present, and they have an average FIFA ranking of 68.1 – six higher than in 2021. We’ve already seen Tunisia (28th in the world) and Algeria (30) finish bottom of their groups after losing respectively to Namibia (115) and Mauritania (105), seven-time winners Egypt (33) crash out to DR Congo (67) and World Cup semi-finalists Morocco (13) lose to South Africa (66). Angola (117), Guinea (80) and Cape Verde (73) are still in the competition this time around and will have their eyes on some more big scalps. Talking of which… None of the last three AFCON winners – Cameroon (2017), Algeria (2019) and Senegal (2021) – remain in this year’s tournament. What’s more, of the winners of the last 13 AFCON tournaments, only two remain – Nigeria (2013) and Ivory Coast (2015). Nigeria are now the favourites to lift the trophy this month, while resurgent hosts Ivory Coast are certainly in with a chance. Those two are AFCON heavyweights, boasting five titles between them. It wouldn’t be surprising to see their names added to the history books if either of them won it this time around (although Ivory Coast winning it after the group stage they had would be a fairly big surprise). The six other quarter-finalists, meanwhile, have just three titles between them; only one of those has come since 1974 (South Africa’s 1996 triumph) and the other two were won by DR Congo under different names – as Congo-Kinshasa in 1968 and as Zaire in 1974. That means 50% of the remaining teams would be maiden winners, and 75% of them would count as a shock were they to win the tournament. We could be in for a genuine surprise this time around. After the group stage, we analysed the stats that proved this was the most exciting AFCON tournament ever. One of those was the goals-per-game rate, which now stands at 2.38, making this the sixth-highest scoring AFCON ever, and the highest-scoring in 13 years. Recent tournaments have been far more cagey than this one. Already at AFCON 2023, we have seen more goals (105) than in the whole of the 2021 (100) and 2019 (102) editions. There appears to have been a little more caution as the tournament has worn on. The first eight knockout games produced 16 goals, with four of those coming from the penalty spot. That means an average of just 1.5 non-penalty goals per game, down from 2.2 per game in the group stage (although from a much smaller sample size). That follows on from a goal-shy end to the group stage, which saw just one goal scored in the final four matches. As the stakes get higher, it appears as though teams might be taking a more careful approach to AFCON 2023. Many of the planet’s best players hail from Africa, so it follows that there are plenty of huge names at AFCON 2023. But instead of putting on a show, the big names have largely flopped. Mohamed Salah, Riyad Mahrez, Achraf Hakmi and Mohamed Kudus are just a few of the stars to have disappointed at the tournament. All of them and their many illustrious teammates have already gone home. Then there is Nigeria’s star striker, Victor Osimhen. Ahead of the quarter-finals, the Napoli man had the most shots (15) and the highest non-penalty expected goals total (2.8) of anyone at the tournament, and yet he’s scored only one goal. And he netted that from about a yard out. This hasn’t been a tournament for the stars to shine. Already at AFCON 2023, we have seen more penalties (excluding shootouts) successfully converted (13) than at any other AFCON tournament. The previous record was 11 in both 2008 and 2021. VAR is having an impact here, with the 17 penalties awarded so far the second-highest total in AFCON history after 2021 (21), but there has also been more quality from the spot. Just 52% of the penalties awarded in 2021 were scored; that success rate has skyrocketed to 76% at the current tournament. The three teams to have had the most shots from counter-attacks at AFCON 2023 – Nigeria, South Africa and Angola (four each) – have been three of the most impressive teams and still remain at the competition. Meanwhile, only three teams to have averaged more than 50% possession – Ivory Coast (61.8%), Mali (56.8%) and Cape Verde (53.8%) – remain in the last eight, and only one of the top seven teams for pass success rate – Ivory Coast (85.3%) – is still there. The overall quality of the players at AFCON has unquestionably gone up, but it looks as though direct play could end up the route to winning it.  Enjoy this?

Nigeria now carry the pressure of being favourites to win the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations following the exit of many of the continents’ big guns before the quarter-final stage. Ranked 42nd in the current FIFA Rankings, Nigeria are the highest-ranked side left in the competition following the exit of Morocco (13th), reigning champions Senegal (20th), Tunisia (28th), Algeria (30th) and Egypt (33rd). In comparison, Angola are the lowest-ranked team (117th) left at AFCON 2023 and will be out to cause one of the biggest shocks in recent memory at the tournament. After a decent point to open AFCON 2023 against Algeria (1-1), Angola have now built up a three-game winning run at the tournament with victories over Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Namibia, but this tie with Nigeria is by far their biggest test yet. Forward Gelson Dala has been in fine form, scoring four goals overall including a brace in the last-16 win over Namibia. Another goal for Dala in this match would ensure a piece of history, as he’d become the first Angolan to score as many as five goals at a single edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. Dala is also their most creative player, having created more than double the number of open-play chances of any other Angolan at the tournament (8), and he also has the highest expected assists total (0.47) in the squad. They’ll have to keep out a Nigerian attack that is stacked with talent, though. No Nigerian striker is better known than Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, who’s both attempted the most shots (15) and has the highest non-penalty expected goals total (2.78) at this tournament. Those chances have produced just one goal so far, however, with Ademola Lookman the hero against Cameroon in the round of 16. The Atalanta forward scored both of their goals in the 2-0 win – his first-ever AFCON goals for Nigeria. This should be an interesting tie for the neutral, with both teams happy to concede possession and play on the counter-attack so far at AFCON 2023. Both Nigeria (45.0%) and Angola (44.0%) have averaged less possession than their opponents, while both feature in the top four teams for shots from counter-attacks – Angola are level with South Africa on five, with Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea following on four. Given that this is Nigeria’s 102nd match at an AFCON, it may come as a surprise to some that this will be the first time that they have met Angola at the tournament. Angola are relatively inexperienced compared to the Nigerians, with only 30 previous AFCON games under their belt, while this is just their third quarter-final appearance at the finals after defeats to Egypt in 2008 and Ghana in 2010. Conversely, Nigeria are playing in a record 11th quarter-final tie at the Africa Cup of Nations – a tally level with Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Tunisia, who were unable to add to their totals in this tournament. Angola’s last victory against Nigeria was a World Cup qualifier in June 2004, which ended 1-0 thanks to a goal from Angola’s all-time top-goal scorer Akwa. Nigeria are predicted to advance to the semi-finals with a win over Angola in this AFCON quarter-final tie on Friday. Across 10,000 pre-match simulations by the Opta supercomputer, Nigeria won the tie inside 90 minutes 55.5% of the time with Angola winning under a quarter of them (22.6%). Extra time was needed in 21.9% of simulations, which also opens up the possibility of a penalty shootout. Following the exit of pre-tournament AFCON favourites Senegal, Nigeria are now given the highest chance of winning the title, while Angola are outsiders among the final eight teams. Here are the current tournament projections for both Nigeria and Angola by the Opta supercomputer as things stand: Angola: Neblú, Kadú, Gelson, António Signori, Eddie, Jonathan Buatu, Inácio Miguel, Tó Carneiro, Kialonda Gaspar, Kinito, Núrio Fortuna, Fredy, Bruno Paz, Manuel Keliano, Beni, Show, Estrela, Gelson Dala, Mabululu, Milson, Depú, Loide Augusto, Gilberto, Chico Banza, Jérémie Bela, Zine, Zito Luvumbo.

Neither DR Congo nor Guinea were expected to be serious contenders at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, but one of these teams will be in the final four after this weekend. Ahead of a ball being kicked at AFCON 2023, the Opta supercomputer had both nations outside the top 10 most likely winners of the tournament, but with some big nations exiting already, this could be the year of the underdog. Guinea made it to the knockout stage as the highest-ranked third-place team in the group stage, as they collected four points with a draw against Cameroon and a win over Gambia in Group C before losing 2-0 to reigning champions Senegal in their final group match. Being drawn against Equatorial Guinea in the round of 16 looked like a tough proposition, with their opponents winning Group A without a defeat. However, Mohamed Bayo scored the latest ever winning goal in an AFCON knockout match to see them off – his strike coming on 97 minutes and 38 seconds. Another goal in this match would see Bayo become the first Guinea player to score three goals at single edition since Pascal Feindouno scored four in 2006. That goal has sent them to the quarter-finals to face DR Congo, who also progressed to the last eight in dramatic circumstances. They prevailed following a penalty shootout against one of the favourites, Egypt after the sides couldn’t be separated in normal and extra time (1-1). There were 18 penalties taken in the shootout, with goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi scoring the winning penalty. DR Congo qualified for the knockout stage without exciting too many – they won just three points in Group F as they qualified behind Morocco with three draws. In fact, DR Congo have drawn their last five AFCON games, their second-longest such run in the competition after drawing their six group stage games across 2013 and 2015 editions. They may have only scored three goals at AFCON 2023 so far, but DR Congo have created good chances. In fact, their expected goals (xG) total of 6.6 is the second highest among the eight quarter-finalists, behind only Nigeria (7.5), but they have underperformed their xG by the most (3.6). Guinea are one of the least productive attacking teams left in the tournament. They may have the same tally of goals as DR Congo (3), but they have had the fewest shots (36) and the lowest xG total (3.5). In defence, they have conceded three goals overall at AFCON 2023, but have amazingly allowed opponents just four shots on target – a competition low. This will be the fourth meeting between DR Congo and Guinea at the Africa Cup of Nations, but the first in the knockout rounds of the tournament. The previous three meetings all came in the group stage, with the last of these in the 2004 edition. Guinea prevailed 2-1 that day after coming from behind, in what was both sides’ opening match of the tournament. The last competitive meeting between DR Congo and Guinea came in a November 2017 World Cup qualifier in Kinshasa. It was 1-1 until second-half added time, when two goals for DR Congo via Jonathan Bolingi and Neeskens Kebano won the game (3-1). It wasn’t enough for either side to progress to the 2018 World Cup, however. This match looks set to be a close contest, with the Opta supercomputer’s pre-match simulations seeing over a quarter (26.7%) of the 10,000 contests played out between DR Congo and Guinea going to extra time. DR Congo are the slight favourites having won 39.9% of the pre-match sims in normal time compared to Guinea’s 33.4%, but it feels there is little chance of a big quarter-final win for either nation. Here are the current tournament projections for both DR Congo and Guinea by the Opta supercomputer as things stand: DR Congo: Baggio Siadi, Lionel Mpasi, Dimitry Bertaud, Arthur Masuaku, Henock Inonga, Chancel Mbemba, Rocky Bushiri, Joris Kayembe, Dylan Batubinsika, Gédéon Kalulu, Gaël Kakuta, Brian Bayeye, Grady Diangana, Samuel Moutoussamy, Aaron Tshibola, Omenuke Mfulu, Charles Pickel, Yoane Wissa, Simon Banza, Meschack Elia, Fiston Mayele, Théo Bongonda, Silas Katompa Mvumpa, Cédric Bakambu.

What was the latest match-winner in the competition? Will the increase in added time mean we see more record-breaking goals in 2023-24? We answer all these questions as we look at the latest goals scored in Premier League history on record (since 2002-03). Given how much added time we are seeing in the 2023-24 season, it was surely only ever a matter of time before we saw the record broken for the latest-ever Premier League goal. If anything, it’s a surprise it took this long. But in mid-January, Sheffield United and West Ham played out a thriller at Bramall Lane, and a late penalty gave the hosts a chance to level the game. An injury to West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola delayed the game significantly, and then Oli McBurnie stepped up to score the latest Premier League goal on record, clocking in his equaliser at 102 minutes and seven seconds. Here, Chris Wilder’s relegation-threatened hosts battled back after twice going behind to earn a point in an ill-tempered affair. This was also the first Premier League game since Boxing Day 2007 between Chelsea and Aston Villa in which both sides saw at least one player sent off and both sides receive at least one penalty each. Drama! Dirk Kuyt’s dramatic late penalty for Liverpool against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 17 April 2011 was the latest goal scored in Premier League history until McBurnie’s goal. Timed at 101 minutes and 48 seconds, it was the equaliser in a 1-1 draw and came just four minutes after Robin van Persie thought he’d picked up all three points for the Gunners as he put them into a 1-0 lead, also from a penalty. The game went so deep into stoppage time due to an injury suffered by Jamie Carragher in the second half. His Liverpool teammate Lucas Leiva was clumsily fouled in the box by Arsenal’s Emmanuel Eboué, which gave Dutch forward Kuyt the chance to steal the latest of points. After witnessing the latest Premier League goal on record 12 years previous, the Emirates Stadium saw the third latest goal scored in the competition in Arsenal’s 3-1 win over Manchester United in September 2023. This time it was scored in Arsenal’s favour. Gabriel Jesus put the cherry on top of a great win over Man Utd with Arsenal’s third goal – a breakaway in which he calmly slotted past United goalkeeper André Onana in the 101st minute of the game. After going behind in the first half to a trademark Marcus Rashford counter-attack goal, Arsenal struck back 101 seconds later through Martin Ødegaard. All was quiet until the 88th minute when the game suddenly sprung to life. The Red Devils thought substitute Alejandro Garnacho had given them the victory, only for VAR to chalk it off for a marginal offside. With eight minutes of added time announced, Declan Rice scored his first Arsenal goal in the 96th minute (95:43) to win the game, before Jesus confirmed the victory with his strike on 100:15. Like Jesus’ goal two weeks earlier, Leon Bailey’s strike in a 3-1 win only confirmed the victory for his side, rather than being the match-winning effort. The Aston Villa winger scored in the 101st minute, with his effort timed exactly at 100 minutes and nine seconds – six seconds earlier than Jesus’ goal against United. Bailey’s clincher came after Douglas Luiz converted a 98th-minute penalty to belatedly turn things around at home to Crystal Palace. The Eagles had led thanks to Odsonne Édouard early in the second half, and Villa weren’t able to reply until Colombian Jhon Durán pulled them level in the 87th minute. The result marked a ninth consecutive home victory for Villa, which is a record for the club in the Premier League era. They would later extend that record to 15 consecutive matches.  Juan Mata’s debut goal for Chelsea against Norwich was at the the time just the second Premier League goal to occur past the 100th minute, just four months after Kuyt’s strike for Liverpool at Arsenal. The extensive stoppage time that allowed for Mata’s goal was due to a head injury suffered by Didier Drogba, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, leading to 11 minutes added at the end of the game. Chelsea had scored first and led at half-time, but an error by Portuguese goalkeeper Hilário led to the Canaries equalising in the 63rd minute through Grant Holt. With 10 minutes to go, John Ruddy’s foul saw the Norwich goalkeeper dismissed and Frank Lampard scored the ensuing penalty. Chelsea rounded off their victory when Mata was then gifted the ball by a defensive error before he placed it in the bottom-left corner to put the result beyond doubt. Although Dejan Kulusevski’s goal for Spurs at home to Sheffield United in September 2023 wasn’t the latest of all time in the Premier League, or even the latest scored on that day, it holds the record for being the latest match-winning goal on record in the competition. The Swede’s strike completed a remarkable comeback for the home side, with this also the latest a side has been behind in a Premier League match (97:33) before eventually going on to win the game. It overtook Tottenham’s own previous record from January 2022 at Leicester City, when they won all three points despite being in a losing position on 94:52. Gus Hamer had put the promoted side ahead at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in the 73rd minute, but Spurs thought they’d stolen a point with a Richarlison header in the eighth minute of stoppage time. Cue pandemonium among the Spurs fans when Kulusevski slammed home the winner two minutes and 20 seconds later. The seventh-latest goal and second-latest winning goal in the Premier League was scored by Bruno Fernandes in September 2020. It was particularly remarkable for another reason – it was scored after the final whistle had been blown. Referee Chris Kavanagh had blown the whistle to end the game at 2-2, before VAR spotted a Neal Maupay handball. Man Utd were then awarded a penalty, which Fernandes dispatched to seal the win. For obvious reasons, this decision was highly controversial, with Brighton boss Graham Potter particularly aggrieved regarding the huge amount of additional time. The AMEX stadium would have been in uproar but for the fact the stadium was empty as the game was played during the Covid-19 pandemic. Brighton eventually had their revenge on United, though. In May 2023, this time at Old Trafford, Brighton were awarded a last-minute penalty, and Alexis Mac Allister stepped up to get payback for the south-coast club as he scored what was the fourth latest winner in the history of the Premier League at the time.

It was hoped Xavi would be the next Pep Guardiola for Barcelona, but he will leave at the end of the season after less than three years in charge. So, what’s gone wrong? By most measures, this season has gone pretty poorly for Barcelona. On Saturday evening, everything came to a head. Xavi Hernández announced he would be leaving his role as manager at the end of the season, seemingly coming to terms with the fact he couldn’t turn the ship around. The decision, he said, was made some time ago, but somewhere between the 84th and 102nd minute when Barcelona conceded three goals to lose 5-3 to Villarreal, he decided he was going to announce it to the world. Captain Xavi watched as his crew were ambushed by a yellow submarine at Montjuic on Saturday night, with that the tipping point in a season filled with disappointment and frustration. Xavi didn’t really specify why he was leaving other than to say that the club needed a change, while complaining that the pressure placed on Barcelona managers is just too suffocating for anyone to truly be successful or celebrated. Barcelona lost to Royal Antwerp and Shakhtar Donetsk this season in the Champions League. They conceded four to Real Madrid and Girona, and then five to Villarreal in La Liga as they sit eight points off the top ahead of Los Blancos facing Getafe on Thursday. Barça also conceded four to Athletic Bilbao in a Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat recently. But these are merely facts, Lilliputian inconveniences for Xavi who believes that whatever he does just won’t be good enough. But why couldn’t Xavi win his critics over and implement what we were told was a crystal clear ideology for total football? Barcelona have been beset by injuries this season to key players. Marc-André ter Stegen played 1,170 minutes in La Liga this term before a back injury ruled him out for a number of months. The German was a big reason why Barcelona won the league last season, as his saves prevented 9.15 goals – fifth among all keepers in the top five leagues with at least 500 minutes played – according to Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) model. He was on course to save Barça’s bacon more often than expected this season too; before his injury, he prevented 1.34 goals.  His replacement, Iñaki Peña, has conceded 2.9 more goals than the average goalkeeper would expect to according to the same model during his 810 minutes between the sticks. Twelve teams have let in fewer goals than Barcelona (29) this season in La Liga; if Xavi mentions tension and anxiety, a lot of it stems from not having the steady hands (and feet) of Ter Stegen behind his backline. In midfield, Gavi’s loss at a crucial time in the season has also been pivotal. He had just been deployed as a defensive midfielder against Real Madrid, doing an excellent job keeping tabs on Jude Bellingham. The England star still stole the show with a thumping shot from outside the box in the second half, but Gavi can’t be blamed for Bellingham’s sheer class. Injury struck just two games after and he was lost for the season. There’s an argument to be made that the opening 45 minutes in the first game against Real Madrid this season with Gavi as the defensive midfielder was the pinnacle of the campaign for Barcelona. Three of the top five players in minutes played last term (Ter Stegen, Alejandro Balde and Gavi) have missed, or will miss, significant parts of the season. Xavi also lost five players in the summer who played over 1,000 minutes in 2022-23, with Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Ousmané Dembélé, Eric Garcia and Ansu Fati all leaving in some capacity. If this is The Impossible Job given the media scrutiny, then it doesn’t help that the squad is unsettled and has been for a number of years now. Busquets left Barcelona last summer to join Lionel Messi at Inter Miami after spending his entire professional career at Camp Nou. Although he was in the twilight of a glittering career, they still needed to replace him. They didn’t, or couldn’t, given their financial predicament. They signed 32-year-old Oriol Romeu, but his lack of athleticism has seen him pushed to the margins with only 716 minutes in the league. He has been subbed off in each of the 10 games he has started this season, including at half-time against Villarreal with Pedri and Frenkie de Jong then playing as the holding midfielders.  De Jong has seen his touches per 90 increase from 93.1 last term to 110.5 in the league this season having generally been asked to play that deep role, but he’s never been seen as a Busquets replacement, rather someone to complement such a player. This is another problem that cascades from having no resources. Names such as Martín Zubimendi and Joshua Kimmich were mentioned as Barcelona targets last summer, but these are the\\xa0crème\\xa0de la crème of holding midfielders. There isn’t a palanca big enough that Joan Laporta could have pulled in the summer to sign either. The Romeu signing made some sense with his history as a Barcelona academy graduate. Pedri, De Jong and İlkay Gündoğan have all stepped in to try and compensate, and sometimes they have even operated in tandem in an attempt to fill the role, but it hasn’t worked. Xavi has said it’s hard for him to watch his players consistently pick the wrong pass when it was something he was so good at as a player. Losing Busquets, a player possessing a seemingly preternatural gift for knowing the right pass every single time, has arguably been more impactful than anyone expected. Barcelona are second in expected goals (50.9) across the big five leagues behind only Bayern Munich (53.5), but they are 30th in expected goals against (24.6) and a significant portion of their goals conceded have come from direct attacks. The very mention of a counter has Barcelona shaking in their boots. For as much possession as Barcelona have (65.1%), it always feels like they’re one counter attack away from conceding. We saw that against Villarreal, the game that sealed Xavi’s fate, when they led 3-2 with less than 10 minutes to play as they conceded three on the break before the referee called a halt to the game with Barcelona crying mercy. They have seen 40 direct attacks against them this season, the third-highest total in La Liga and which highlights an inability to snuff out counters before they start. They have conceded five goals from those attacks; only Villarreal have poorer record when defending these situations (6). Xavi played for Pep Guardiola, whose version of Barcelona were masters of defending with the ball. The current iteration under Xavi’s watch have proven themselves incapable of doing the same. With a shaky backline and an inability to defend with the ball, Xavi needed his biggest names to finish the chances that Barcelona did create. That hasn’t happened. While some of the excuses the current manager has used are difficult to back up with statistics, this one certainly isn’t. No team in La Liga has a higher xG total this season than Barcelona (50.9). Girona are a distant second (40), followed by Real Madrid (38.1) and Atlético Madrid (38). Barça have underperformed in relation to their xG, though, scoring 6.9 goals fewer than would be expected considering the quality of those opportunities. This is in stark comparison to Real Madrid, who’ve scored 6.9 more than expected. Barça have had 82 big chances this season in the league (second behind only Bayern Munich with 85 across Europe’s top five leagues). They have missed 55 of those, which tops all teams in the top five European leagues, and have a 32.9% big-chance conversion rate, which is considerably below average (39.2%). Robert Lewandowski is the biggest culprit in a team of profligate chance-wasters, which feels like a remarkable thing to write considering his prolific past. The Pole has a 28.6% big-chance conversion rate; only Darwin Nuñez has a poorer record (20%) this season for players with more than 20 big chances in Europe’s top five leagues. Lewandowski has missed 15 and scored six.  The narrative around Xavi might be the same even if Barcelona managed to finish more of those big chances given their inability to defend, but at least he might have a few more positive results as he heads in to the final months of his time on Barcelona’s sideline. Xavi can have his reasons for leaving, but ultimately the results haven’t been good enough.  “I take the ultimate responsibility,” he said after Saturday’s defeat. History might be kind to the club legend but the solutions to most of the recurring problems we saw during his reign are up to the coach. He simply couldn’t find them. Enjoy this?

Can Adam Wharton give Crystal Palace what they have been missing in the middle in recent games? It has been a very quiet January transfer window, especially in the Premier League. We certainly didn’t think one of the more exciting deals of the window would involve Crystal Palace buying someone from Blackburn Rovers, but here we are. England Under-20 international Adam Wharton is on his way to south London for a reported fee of up to £22 million with add-ons. It has been an underwhelming season for Palace so far, summarised by the travelling fans during the recent 5-0 thrashing at Arsenal holding up banners reading: “Wasted potential on and off the pitch. Weak decisions. Taking us backwards.” This was presumably aimed at the ownership, but it was a sad image seeing manager Roy Hodgson gazing at the away fans holding up the scathing words after his team had been well beaten. Things must have felt even worse when Ben Brereton Díaz gave bottom-placed Sheffield United the lead at Selhurst Park on Tuesday after just 20 seconds, only for Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise to combine to turn things around for a much-needed 3-2 win. There is little arguing that the Palace squad could do with some boosting, though. They have the worst tackle success in the Premier League (55.2%) and only five teams average lower than their 42.7% possession this season, so more steel and control in midfield would be most welcome, especially having been without Cheick Doucouré since November. The Mali international has been out with an Achilles tendon issue and won’t be back any time soon, so it always seemed likely that Palace would look for a deep-lying midfielder in this transfer window. That could be why they have turned to one of the most exciting prospects in the Championship. Palace have had some joy signing players from England’s second tier. Eze and Olise are the star players at Selhurst Park having arrived from Queens Park Rangers and Reading respectively. They were responsible for all three of Palace’s goals against Sheffield United on Tuesday (two goals for Eze; a goal and two assists for Olise). How they could do with someone else stepping up to match their impact, though. Wharton has more than stepped up since coming into the senior side at Blackburn. Having come through the youth setup at his local club, the 19-year-old won their young player of the year award last season and is now fully ensconced as a first-team regular. Only Callum Brittain (27) has featured in more Championship games for Blackburn this season than Wharton (26), while only four Rovers teammates have accrued more minutes played than his 1,960. He has two goals and three assists despite playing predominantly as a defensive midfielder. In the main, Wharton has partnered Sondre Tronstad in a midfield two for Jon Dahl Tomasson’s side, though he has also occasionally featured in more attacking midfield roles, including on the left wing. His off-the-ball work has previously been questioned but only 12 midfielders in the Championship (minimum of 10 starts) have averaged more tackles per game than Wharton’s 2.8 this season, while only 22 have made more recoveries. Only Tronstad can match his overall number of tackles (60), no-one has competed in as many as his 245 duels (49.8% success) and only centre-back Hayden Carter (35) has made more than his 32 interceptions. It is his work on the ball that gets the most attention, though. Among his Blackburn teammates this season, only Andrew Moran (6) has more assists than Wharton while no-one has created as many chances as his 35. Only six midfielders in the Championship have made more than his 109 progressive passes this season. As you can see below, he takes most of his touches at the base of midfield, but doesn’t limit himself to that area of the pitch too much. Comparing his numbers to his potential future teammates at Crystal Palace, Wharton stacks up fairly well, albeit in the division below. He averages far more passes per 90 minutes (55.2) than any Palace midfielder this season, though the difference in style of play between Blackburn and the Eagles must be taken into account. His overall passing accuracy of 84.6% is bettered by Doucouré (87.2%), Will Hughes (86.5%) and Eze (85.3%) but his average of 1.6 chances created per 90 is only behind Eze (2.6). From a defensive viewpoint, Wharton’s rates of interceptions (1.5) and recoveries (6.6) per 90 are only behind Doucouré (1.9 interceptions, 7.2 recoveries). He tackles slightly less than Doucouré (3.3) and Hughes (2.9) but again, that could mostly be due to Palace being a more defence-focused team than Blackburn. As you can see from the two graphics below, he has also started influencing games across a greater area of the pitch. Last season the majority of his forward passes went down Blackburn’s left side, whereas this season his contributions have been a lot more spread out. In December, former Milan striker Tomasson heaped praise on the youngster, saying of Wharton: “On the ball, he’s Champions League level, I’ve said that many times. I’ve played there and coached enough at Champions League level and I should know that.” The Blackburn boss did also acknowledge that the player still has plenty to learn. Wharton clearly has a calm and sensible head on his shoulders, though. In an interview with Scouted last month, he cited notable names from the game as inspirations. “Obviously I love watching Lionel Messi but I’m sure everyone does. Frenkie de Jong too, I really like how he plays,” he said. “Sergio Busquets manages to make everything look so simple with one or two touches but it’s so effective – I think Rodri at Manchester City would probably be a more current comparison. “More casual watchers of the game probably won’t realise how much players like Busquets or Rodri affect the game, or how valuable they are. That’s why I like to take different bits from lots of top players, but I’m my own player in my own way – and that’s just as important.”  With a shaven head and low-hanging socks, Wharton might not look like your typical Premier League superstar. But if he can continue to build on the foundations his time at Blackburn has given him, there’s no reason he can’t soar with the Eagles over the next few years. Enjoy this?

When Gareth Barry came on as a 49th-minute substitute for Aston Villa on 2 May 1998 against Sheffield Wednesday, little did we know that over 20 years later he would still be plying his trade as a professional footballer. Granted, the final two years of his career were played in the second tier, but by then Barry had already set the mark for most Premier League appearances at 653. Barry’s Premier League debut may have come even earlier as he’d been named on the bench nearly a month prior against West Ham United but didn’t come on. In fact, a Barry substitute appearance was a rare occurrence. He made 618 starts during his Premier League career, enough for a healthy 94.6% start rate. Unsurprisingly, Barry holds the record for the most minutes played by a Premier League player (54,439). Despite playing for the likes of Aston Villa, Manchester City, Everton and West Brom over the course of his Premier League career, Barry isn’t in the top 10 for games won. He does top the charts when it comes to games drawn (193) and games drawn nil-nil (64), however, and he’s suffered the second-most defeat (198) behind a player who we’ll come to later in this list. A solid and dependable midfielder, who made 53 appearances for England, Barry christened his 600th appearance in the Premier League with a strike for Everton against Arsenal – the 52nd league goal of his career. One final goal would follow against Manchester United, the side he lost more to (24 times) than any other during his Premier League career before an injury derailed his 2017-18 season, ending in West Brom’s relegation to the Championship. James Milner is the only active player to rank in the top 20 for most Premier League appearances. A former teammate of Frank Lampard’s at Man City, Milner overtook his old colleague in April 2023 with an 11-minute cameo in Liverpool’s 0-0 draw against Chelsea. He then leapfrogged Ryan Giggs into outright second place when he started for Brighton against Wolves in January 2024. If you think of some of the iconic Premier League moments since November 2002, there’s a good chance Milner has been a part of them. He was part of the Leeds United team that suffered a 5-0 defeat at the hands of Arsenal to start the downward spiral that saw them relegated from the top flight. And after spells with Newcastle United and Aston Villa, he was part of the Manchester City side that won the title in dramatic “AGUERROoOoOoOoO!!!” fashion before winding up as part of Jürgen Klopp’s revolution at Anfield. Uniquely, Milner has been substituted on the most times in Premier League history (204), ahead of the likes of Peter Crouch and Shane Long (both 158), Jermaine Defoe (149) and Shola Ameobi (142). As you might have expected, the 24 instances of Milner coming on from the bench in the 2022-23 season was the most of his career as age began to limit his involvement a little more. Nevertheless, he showed enough to earn a free transfer to Brighton for the 2023-24 campaign, meaning Milner’s quest to break Barry’s all-time appearances record is still alive. With his appearance on the opening day of the 2023-24 campaign versus Luton Town, Milner equalled Giggs’ record of playing a game in 22 different Premier League seasons. Ryan Giggs made his league bow for Manchester United the season before the Premier League’s inaugural campaign, so it’s no surprise the winger ranks highly when it comes to overall appearances in the history of the competition. It’s even less surprising that Giggs has more assists (162) than anyone else, some 51 clear of his nearest rival, Cesc Fábregas. Despite scoring 109 goals during his Premier League career, Giggs never netted a hat-trick in his 632 appearances even though he did manage 11 braces. He only needed five appearances to net his first goal in the competition but failed to find the back of the net in his last 20 in the Premier League. Having won 13 Premier League titles with Manchester United during his career, Giggs has comfortably won more games than any other player in Premier League history (407), and when you look at that in the context of United’s victories total (726 – correct as of July 2023) in the competition, it means the Welshman played in 56% of their triumphs. Of the players in this article, it’s Giggs who has been subbed off the most (134), with Theo Walcott (168), Aaron Lennon (141) and David Silva (137) the only ones to have seen their number raised more often. It means Giggs only ranks fourth when it comes to minutes played (46,437). Frank Lampard came closest to matching Giggs’ record for the most wins in the Premier League (349), the first of which coming on his debut on 31 January 1996 as he made an 80th-minute substitute appearance against Coventry City for West Ham. A broken leg in the 1996-97 season delayed his breakthrough, but he returned in emphatic fashion the following campaign, scoring on the opening day of the season barely a minute after coming on as a substitute against Barnsley. It would be the first of 177 goals Lampard scored in the Premier League for West Ham United, Chelsea and Manchester City, including one in his final appearance against Southampton on the last day of 2014-15. A strike earlier in the season against former club Chelsea also produced possibly the greatest ‘muted’ goal celebration in Premier League history. Being the highest-ranked goalkeeper on this list might go some way to reducing the disappointment of not being the keeper with the most clean sheets in Premier League history; only Petr Cech (202) is ahead of David James (169). James’ first Premier League appearance, his debut for Liverpool, came on the opening weekend of the inaugural season following his transfer from Watford, starting against Nottingham Forest in the first ever Super Sunday match shown on Sky Sports. Unfortunately, this also makes him the first goalkeeper to concede a goal in a live televised Premier League match, with Teddy Sheringham putting the only goal of the game past him. This was the first of 665 goals he would concede in the Premier League for the Reds, Aston Villa, West Ham United, Manchester City and Portsmouth which is also a record for the competition. For a while, James held the record for the most appearances in the Premier League before being overtaken by the four players above. He also achieved the unusual feat of appearing in the competition as both a goalkeeper and an outfield player, having been thrown up front by Stuart Pearce as Manchester City chased down potential European qualification on the final day of the 2004-05 season. They fell short following a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough with James unable to make an impact, even though he did concede two fouls in a Premier League game for the only time in his career. James beat the record previously held by the late Gary Speed, for whom goals were plenty during his career but they probably came no sweeter than on 20 November 1996. A boyhood Everton fan, his dream of playing for the club was realised when he moved to Goodison Park at the start of that season, before scoring the equaliser in the Merseyside derby in front of the Kop. The only hat-trick of his Premier League career also came while wearing his beloved blue in a 7-1 mauling of Southampton. But to talk about goals misses so much of what makes Speed a player still remembered fondly by many fans and former teammates from Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers. A life gone far too soon following his death at the age of 42. The first out-and-out forward on the list, Emile Heskey might be seventh when it comes to number of appearances in the Premier League but his haul of 110 is ‘only’ good enough for 26th on the list of all-time goalscorers. But where the former Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic and Aston Villa star proved his worth was by being one of the most unselfish players on the field. Making decoy runs, holding up the ball for others and providing a fair share of assists (53) ensured he won a place in the hearts of fans and teammates alike. None more so than Michael Owen, who saw his golden years – culminating in the 2001 Ballon d’Or – heavily supported by his Liverpool (and England) teammate Heskey, with the pair scoring 30 Premier League goals between them during the 2000-2001 season, as well as combining as part of England’s famous 5-1 triumph over Germany when, yes, even Heskey scored.\\xa0 Remember how we mentioned earlier in this article that one player in the Premier League had lost more games than Gareth Barry? Well, step right up Mark Schwarzer – it’s time for your moment to shine. The Australian is the only player, so far, in the history of the Premier League to have racked up 200 defeats. With 145 draws to his name as well (54 of which were 0-0), it means Schwarzer left a Premier League stadium without winning 67.1% of the time. All bar ten of his appearances came for Middlesbrough and Fulham as he became the first – and so far, only – non-British player to make over 500 appearances in the Premier League. He was part of two title-winning squads in back-to-back seasons (Chelsea and Leicester City), but he didn’t play enough games to qualify automatically for a medal. Liverpool’s all-time leading appearance maker in the Premier League, Jamie Carragher made his debut for the club when Roy Evans was in charge at Anfield, before being part of their success under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benítez. Although the Premier League title eluded him, Carragher’s mantlepiece is loaded with a UEFA Champions League winner’s medal, as well as three FA Cup triumphs.\\xa0 Famously, Carragher only scored three EPL goals for Liverpool during his career but did manage to turn the ball into the back of his own net on seven occasions – joint second-most in the competition’s history. You can read more about Carragher’s own-goal exploits here, as well as finding out who the overall record holder is (a clue: he played 431 times in the Premier League).\\xa0 In a game of Top Trumps between the Neville brothers, this would be one section where Phil comfortably comes out on top having made 105 more appearances in the Premier League than Gary Neville. He also has the advantage when it comes to goals (Phil’s nine to Gary’s five, what a way to make a living), although assists do fall in Gary’s favour (35 to 25), as well as Premier League winner’s medals (eight to six).\\xa0 Phil’s transfer to Everton ahead of the 2005-06 season led to many highlights, with the brothers refusing to engage with each other in the tunnel when both captaining their sides in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford in 2012 that proved pivotal in the deciding the title-race.

After suffering back-to-back defeats in their first two matches of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast’s chances of winning the title on home territory looked remote; now, though, they’re just two games away from the final having seen off defending champions Senegal in the last 16. Mali stand in their way next, and although Ivory Coast’s inauspicious start was hardly conducive to building confidence, eliminating the favourites last time out 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw will have them believing they can deal with anyone. Ivory Coast’s run to the last eight shouldn’t be taken for granted either. After winning the 2015 edition, they only got to the quarter-finals once over the next three tournaments. Nevertheless, the host nation have ridden their luck to this point; they scraped through their group and an 86th-minute Franck Kessié penalty was necessary to take their last-16 clash to extra time before holding their nerve in the shootout. Mali may see Ivory Coast the lesser of two evils compared to Senegal, however. They deservedly defeated Burkina Faso 2-1 in the last 16; if they get past the Elephants, they’ll reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2013. They finished third then, as they did in the 2012 edition as well. Beating the hosts on Saturday would be a real statement for a side hoping to claim their first ever AFCON crown. They reached the final during their first participation in 1972 and got to at least the semis in half of the 12 tournaments they’ve qualified for before this one, but glory has eluded them. Saturday’s game also promises to be a particularly emotional one for their head coach, Eric Chelle. Although a former Mali international, Chelle was born in Ivory Coast and revealed this week that he has several friends and former colleagues among the Elephants’ staff. This will be the sixth Africa Cup of Nations encounter between Mali and Ivory Coast, and their first since meeting since Ivory Coast won their 2019 last-16 duel 1-0. In fact, Ivory Coast have never lost an AFCON match against Mali, winning four of their previous five games (D1). Against no other team have they played more often in the competition without ever losing. Mali scored just two goals in those previous five AFCON clashes with Ivory Coast (conceding nine). They’ve not scored fewer goals against any other team they’ve met more than twice in the competition. Ivory Coast may be the hosts and blessed with a talented squad, but the Opta supercomputer considers Mali as the favourites here, winning 42.3% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations in 90 minutes. On the other side of the coin, Ivory Coast won 31.6% of the time, so they’re hardly out of the running. The game went to extra time in 26.1% of the simulations. Ivory Coast’s chances of winning the title have, understandably, increased compared to our pre-tournament predictions, but probably not as much as you’d think. Because of their largely underwhelming results, their success probability is rated at 13.5% by the Opta supercomputer; Mali are now considered the second favourites with a 14.7% likelihood of going all the way. Below you’ll find the current, up-to-date tournament projections for both teams according to the Opta supercomputer:  Mali: Djigui Diarra, Aboubacar Doumbia, Ismaël Diawara, Mamadou Fofana I, Kiki Kouyaté, Sikou Niakaté, Hamari Traoré, Amadou Danté, Falaye Sacko, Moussa Diarra, Lassana Coulibaly, Adama Traoré, Yves Bissouma, Amadou Haidara, Aliou Dieng, Diadié Samassékou, Kamory Doumbia, Boubacar Traoré, Mohamed Camara, Moussa Doumbia, Sékou Koïta, Fousseni Diabaté, Ibrahim Sissoko, Lassine Sinayoko, Siriné Doucouré, Youssoufou Niakaté, Nene Dorgeles.\\xa0 Coach: Éric Chelle\\xa0 Ivory Coast: Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté.\\xa0 Coach: Emerse Faé\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Neither Cape Verde nor South Africa will have realistically thought they would be here. Facing one another in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals when the vast majority would have expected it to be Egypt vs Morocco. Cape Verde finished top of a group that contained Egypt and Ghana, while South Africa sent World Cup 2022 semi-finalists Morocco packing in the round of 16 on Tuesday. Now the teams ranked 73rd and 66th respectively in the world by FIFA meet for a place in the final four of AFCON 2023, and on paper, it’s anyone’s game. Their 2-2 draw in their final Group B game against Egypt is the only time Cape Verde haven’t won a game so far in this year’s tournament (W3), and they are looking to reach the AFCON semi-finals for the first time ever. The Blue Sharks beat Mauritania 1-0 in the round of 16, taking them to just their second ever quarter-final after a 2-0 loss to Ghana in the 2013 tournament. Bubista’s side have certainly relied on their experience. Cape Verde have the oldest average starting XI at AFCON 2023 at 29 years and 64 days old. Five of their eight goals have been scored by players aged 30 or over, with Egypt the last team with more goals in a single edition from players aged 30+ back in 1998 (7). South Africa produced one of the many shocks of the tournament when they beat Morocco 2-0 in the last 16. Goals from Evidence Makgopa and Teboho Mokoena secured victory against the Atlas Lions, handing the Bafana Bafana their third quarter-final in their last four AFCONs, though they are looking to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2000. Manager Hugo Broos will be relying on his team’s solid defence to help them advance, having kept three consecutive clean sheets at the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time since February 1998. However, South Africa have never stopped their opponents from scoring in four AFCON matches in a row. Going the other way, Themba Zwane will hope to make a contribution again. He has been directly involved in 50% (3/6) of South Africa’s goals at this year’s tournament (two goals, one assist), and could become the first player to score three goals in a single edition of AFCON for the Bafana Bafana since Shaun Bartlett in 2000 (5). The winner will face either new tournament favourites Nigeria or Angola in the final four. Cape Verde and South Africa will meet for the second time at the Africa Cup of Nations, after a 0-0 draw in the group stage in 2013. That was Cape Verde’s first ever AFCON match and the opening game of the tournament, hosted by South Africa. They have also clashed four times in World Cup qualifiers, with South Africa winning twice in the campaign for the 2006 tournament, while Cape Verde returned the favour in the campaign for the 2018 World Cup.  Cape Verde are made slight favourites by the Opta supercomputer, but it’s a very close run thing. The Blue Sharks are given a 37.5% chance of winning inside 90 minutes, with South Africa handed a 35.2% chance. The draw – which would send it to extra time – is rated at 27.3%. Overall, Cape Verde advanced from the tie in 51.3% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations, with South Africa going through the other 48.7% of the time. Despite the elimination of the likes of Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, Algeria and Cameroon, neither of these two are considered among the favourites to win the whole tournament, with a less than 10% chance each. The latest Opta supercomputer predictions are below: Cape Verde: Márcio da Rosa, Vózinha, Dylan Silva, Stopira, Dylan Tavares, João Correia, Logan Costa, Steven Moreira, Pico, Diney Borges, Kenny Rocha, Laros Duarte, Deroy Duarte, Kevin Pina, Cuca, Patrick Andrade, Jamiro Monteiro, João Paulo, Ryan Mendes, Willy Semedo, Garry Rodrigues, Jovane Cabral, Bebé, Bryan Teixeira, Hélio Varela, Gilson Benchimol.

But who are those players that have taken that to the extreme and have never lost a Premier League game while netting? Behold, these are the league’s lucky charms. First, a quick cautionary tale. We’ll get onto the Premier League’s lucky charms in a few moments. But pour one out for the top-flight’s most unlucky player: Huddersfield Town and Brentford’s Zanka, who has ended up on the losing side in all four of the games he’s scored in to date. Or Matt Le Tisser, who scored in 79 games across his Premier League career, but still lost a staggering 32% of those matches. Scoring and winning isn’t for everyone. But here’s the list of the players that have scored in the most individual games without losing a single one of them. Aside from his four Premier League winners’ medals, Gabriel Jesus is the owner of another enviable league record. His 73 Premier League goals have come in 60 different matches, but the real kicker? In every single one of those 60 games he’s scored in, his side have never lost. Of course, it helps that Jesus has exclusively played in exceptionally dominant sides. That’s why he’s managed to speed up this list so quickly, despite playing just 202 matches in the competition. 159 of those came for Manchester City who Jesus joined in the summer of 2016-17 – the same window that saw Pep Guardiola arrive. Now he’s in north London having moved to Arsenal in the summer of 2022-23 and after narrowly missing out on adding a fifth Premier League title to his personal honours list in his debut season at the club, 2023-24 still offers a chance of glory. At present, Jesus has a 91.7% win rate in games that he’s scored in – that includes Arsenal’s 2-1 victory away at Nottingham Forest on Matchday 22 of this season. Only two players to have scored in 20+ games without losing can better that feat (Pedro 96.3% and Antonio Valencia 95.7%) James Milner always appears in these lists, doesn’t he? When he’s not appearing in the list for the youngest Premier League scorers of all-time, or those who’ve made the most appearances, he appears in ones like this. Milner has scored in 54 games across his Premier League career in spells at Leeds United, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool. Only Jesus has scored in more games without losing a single one of them. Mr. Reliable does it once again… but he’s still yet to score for current side Brighton & Hove Albion in the competition. Darius Vassell scored 52 Premier League goals across 265 appearances for Aston Villa and Manchester City. Those goals came in 46 games and Vassell remained unbeaten in every single one. \\xa0 Vassell did find himself on the losing side after scoring for Leicester City in their 3-2 loss to Nottingham Forest in April 2011 but thankfully for him this came in the Championship and not the top flight. His place of this list is safe. Of course, you don’t have to lose a game for footballing heartbreak to find you as Vassell knows all too well. After England’s 2-2 draw against Portugal in the quarter-finals of Euro 2004, Vassell missed England’s last spot-kick in the penalty shootout, allowing Portugal’s goalkeeper Ricardo to score the winner. Rather than that painful memory, perhaps we ought to remember Vassell more fondly for being Aston Villa and Man City’s lucky charm over a large chunk of the noughties. Last season was a frustrating one for Diogo Jota. He was only able to play 33% of league minutes for Liverpool (1,131) in what was an injury-interrupted campaign. Just over halfway through this season, Jota’s nearing that minutes tally already, while he’s already beaten his total of seven Premier League goals in 2022-23 with eight this term. That’s good news for Liverpool, with Jota being one of the most luckiest players in Premier League history. His total of 44 games scored in without losing is only beaten by three players, and the 27-year-old has time on his side.  Overall, the Portuguese has scored in 32 different league games for Jurgen Klopp’s side and hasn’t been on the losing side once. His time on Merseyside got off to a flying start, with Jota not only becoming the first player since Robbie Fowler to score as many as seven goals in his first 10 appearances, but the first Liverpool player to score in each of his first four Premier League home games. Jota also scored in 12 different matches for Wolves during his time at Molineux and wasn’t on the losing side with them either. That’s perhaps a slightly more impressive feat given Jota’s first season in the top flight came as Wolves had just been promoted. There’s never going to be a goals-based record that Erling Haaland isn’t in the mix for, and this one is no different. The Manchester City man has scored in 32 separate Premier League games, with his side winning 27 and draw five of those. What’s frightening about the Norwegian’s record here is just how quickly he’s jumped into the top five of this list. He’s actually joint-fifth, tied with Salomon Kalou (below), but while Kalou’s goals came over a 156-game career, Haaland has made just 50 appearances in the competition at the time of writing. Haaland joined Man City in the summer of 2022 and played a critical role in their continental treble, breaking the record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League season along the way. Pep Guardiola’s side have never lost when Haaland has notched and, given their domestic dominance, we can expect him to race up this list.\\xa0 Salomon Kalou is another striker blessed to have played in a dominant team during his Premier League days. Although he won just one Premier League title with Chelsea over his six-year career in west London, he was still part of the team that won both the FA Cup and League Cup in 2006-07 as well as finishing second in the Premier League, and part of the side that finished second, third, first and second in the four subsequent seasons. Kalou – who had been brought to the club by José Mourinho after impressing with Feyenoord in the Eredivisie – only hit double figures for league goals in one season (2010-11), but whenever he scored Chelsea were safe. He notched in 32 games for the Blues, winning 29 of those and drawing three. That’s the top six, but how about a look at the other players to have scored in 20+ Premier League games and not taste defeat. As mentioned, Pedro (96.3% win rate) only failed to win one of the games he scored in across his English top-flight career (a 1-1 draw against Burnley in February 2017 for those wondering). Given his youth and the team he plays for, Arsenal’s Gabriel Martinelli could quickly climb up the list, while it’s good to see Everton’s reliable skipper Seamus Coleman make an appearance. Oyvind Leonhardsen: 28 Games Scored In (W21 D7) Pedro: 27 Games Scored In (W26 D1) Gabriel Martinelli: 27 Games Scored In (W23 D4) Antonio Valencia: 23 Games Scored In (W22 D1) Georginio Wijnaldum: 23 Games Scored In (W19 D4) Marcos Alonso: 23 Games Scored In (W17 D6) Seamus Coleman: 22 Games Scored In (W17 D5) Enjoy this?

We look ahead to Wednesday’s game with our Liverpool vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Sunday was an emotional day as Liverpool played their first game since it was announced that Jürgen Klopp will leave the club at the end of the season, with the German receiving a tremendous reception at Anfield before his side overcame Norwich City 5-2 in the FA Cup fourth round. Klopp has called for Liverpool to “squeeze everything” out of his final months at the helm, and Wednesday’s clash with Chelsea represents a chance for the Reds to maintain their momentum at the Premier League summit. Klopp’s current win rate of 60.8% is the highest of any Liverpool manager to have overseen 100 or more games, while he is the only Reds boss to win the top flight, European Cup/UEFA Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. However, the German will be desperate to cap his reign with a second league title, and Liverpool enter Matchday 22 five points clear of second-placed Manchester City, albeit having played a game more. As well as advancing to the EFL Cup final and the fifth round of the FA Cup, Liverpool are into the UEFA Europa League last 16 and have won their last three Premier League games, beating Newcastle United 4-2 and Bournemouth 4-0 in their last two. They last won three successive league matches while netting four or more goals in each between November and December 2021. Darwin Núñez and Diogo Jota scored twice each against Bournemouth in their last league game and also found the net once apiece against Norwich. With Mohamed Salah still sidelined by the muscle injury he suffered at the Africa Cup of Nations, both could have key roles to play again here. With seven goals and six assists, Núñez already has more goal involvements in 20 Premier League appearances this season than he managed in 29 last term (nine goals, three assists). He has four winning goals in the competition this campaign, a tally only matched by Chelsea’s Cole Palmer. Jota now has 38 goals in 91 Premier League appearances for Liverpool, hitting the net once every 141 minutes on average for the Reds. Since Opta began collecting Premier League shot data in 2003-04, only Divock Origi (20.8%) boasts a higher shot conversation rate for Liverpool than Jota (19.3%). Liverpool received a treble boost on Sunday as Dominik Szoboszlai, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson returned after spells on the sidelines, all appearing from the bench. Klopp is also confident of having midfielder Alexis Mac Allister available after he missed the Norwich win with a slight knock, though the outgoing Liverpool boss remains without Thiago Alcântara, Kostas Tsimikas and Stefan Bajcetic, while Wataru Endo is still at the AFC Asian Cup with Japan. While Liverpool have done a good job of leading from the front lately, Klopp’s side have shown incredible fight in the face of adversity this season, winning 19 points from losing positions – more than any other Premier League team and a tally they have only bettered in three previous campaigns (22 in 2008-09, 20 in 1993-94 and 20 in 2021-22). Meanwhile, only Aston Villa (three) have dropped fewer points from winning positions than Chelsea in 2023-24 (four, level with Liverpool). Mauricio Pochettino’s men will also face Liverpool in the EFL Cup final next month after overcoming Middlesbrough in last week’s semi-finals. They followed up a resounding 6-1 win over Michael Carrick’s side by being held to a goalless draw by Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Friday. In the Premier League, Chelsea finally seem to have discovered some consistency, winning their last three games – as many wins as they managed in their previous 10 (two draws, five defeats). Another victory at Anfield would make Pochettino the first Blues boss to win four straight league games since Thomas Tuchel led them to five victories in a row between January and March 2022. Chelsea overcame neighbours Fulham in their last league game, with Palmer converting a first-half penalty after Raheem Sterling was brought down by Issa Diop. Palmer has scored all five of his Premier League penalties for Chelsea, with only Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (12/12) boasting a better 100% record in the competition for the Blues. Since Palmer scored his first Premier League goal against Burnley in October, only Salah (11) has more goals in the competition than the former Man City man (nine). As for Chelsea’s team news ahead of kick-off, Palmer could be joined by Christopher Nkunku in the visitors’ attack, with the Frenchman back in training after battling a groin injury. Goalkeeper Robert Sánchez, right-back Malo Gusto and midfielder Roméo Lavia are also closing in on returns, but they remain without Reece James, Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella, while Nicolas Jackson is still away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Nobody should be particularly surprised if these two are tough to separate in this Premier League clash on Wednesday, with each of the last seven meetings between them in all competitions finishing level. It is the longest run of consecutive draws between two top-flight clubs in English football history, and four of the last five have finished goalless (including penalty shootout wins for Liverpool in the 2022 EFL and FA Cup finals). Neutrals will be hoping for more goalmouth action this time around. We did get a goal at each end when the teams met on Matchday 1 at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea debutant Axel Disasi cancelling out Luis Díaz’s opener. While Liverpool have only lost one of their last 11 Premier League games against Chelsea (four wins, six draws), they are also winless in their last six versus the Blues (five draws, one defeat). Anfield victories have been a rare occurrence for Chelsea, though, with the Blues only winning two of their last 11 Premier League away games against Liverpool (six draws, three losses) – those triumphs came on successive visits in April 2019 and July 2020. Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 22 Premier League games at Anfield since suffering a 2-1 defeat against Leeds United in October 2022. Only Aston Villa (28) have bettered their return of 26 top-flight points won on home soil in 2023-24. Chelsea, meanwhile, have lost half of their 10 away league games under Pochettino, with four of those defeats coming in their last five games (against Newcastle, Manchester United, Everton and Wolves). Chelsea do tend to fare well against the Premier League’s best, winning more games against teams starting the day top of the table than any other club in the competition’s history (18). However, they are winless in their last four such games against Liverpool (one draw, three defeats) since beating them 2-0 at Anfield under José Mourinho in April 2014, a game that featured Steven Gerrard’s infamous slip and handed Man City the initiative in the title race. The\\xa0Opta Power Rankings\\xa0are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides: The Opta supercomputer is forecasting an end to the run of stalemates between these sides, with a Liverpool win occurring in 54.9% of pre-match simulations. Chelsea extend their winning run to four league games in just 19.5% of scenarios, while 25.6% of the supercomputer’s simulations see the points shared. Liverpool’s strong run of form over the winter has seen their title hopes boosted to 37.2% in the supercomputer’s season predictions, putting them comfortably clear of Arsenal (3%) and Villa (1.1%) but still making them second favourites behind City (58.6%). Chelsea, meanwhile, are assigned a 22.1% chance of a top-seven finish, which would likely bring European qualification. However, 10th (17.8%) is still seen as their most likely final position.

We take a look a why Aston Villa have decided to splash out on him. Morgan Rogers’ move to Aston Villa is a curious one. The 21-year-old only moved to Middlesbrough from Manchester City in the summer, and cost just £1 million back then. Now, six months on, he has secured his return to the Premier League with Aston Villa for potentially 16 times that fee. Reports on Tuesday suggested that his transfer to Villa would cost an initial £8m and eventually up to £16m with all add-ons included. At a time when there is also talk that Villa have considered the possibility of selling a prized asset – someone like Jacob Ramsey – to guarantee compliance with Premier League profitability and sustainability rules come the end of the season, it’s a surprise to see them spending a far-from-insignificant sum on a player who has only 28 Championship starts to his name. In his half-season with Middlesbrough, Rogers hadn’t even convinced many of his own supporters of his worth. There have been a fair few raised eyebrows among their fans that Rogers is stepping up to a club at the top end of the Premier League for so much money. So, what exactly have Aston Villa seen in Rogers that convinced them to sign him? The first thing to say is that he is still very young and incredibly raw. He has only played 5,106 league minutes as a professional, with just 54% of those coming in the second tier (2,773). So, signing him is a gamble, but Villa presumably see the potential upside as worth paying for right now. Whether he can play a part for the first team straight away is another matter entirely. Rogers is an attacking midfielder who likes to get into positions between the lines to link play, preferring to start in a number 10 position and roam from there. In Michael Carrick’s 4-2-3-1 at Boro, there was the perfect spot for him in behind the striker, which is where he played most of the time for them this season. He can also play out wide or up front, but his inclination is always to move into central positions because he likes to receive the ball to feet. That is naturally a useful trait in certain regards, not least because by moving away from his starting position he gives his direct opponent a decision to make as to whether to follow him. But at the same time, his team can lose out from him moving away from the position he is supposed to be occupying. For example, when he plays up front, he will rarely pin the centre-backs deep in their own territory, and when he is out wide, he doesn’t stretch the opposition’s defence by hugging the touchline and pulling a full-back away from the centre-backs. He is, however, very adept at receiving in tight spaces so he is well-suited to getting on the ball between the lines. He is very comfortable receiving on the half-turn, has a fantastic first touch and scans constantly, so when the ball comes his way he often manages to move play on with one touch, whether that is to a teammate he is facing or by turning towards goal and progressing play. He ranks 12th in the Championship of players with 1,000+ minutes played for successful layoffs per 90 (1.7), and second for through balls per 90 (0.8), behind only Alex Pritchard (0.9). Rogers prefers to create rather than go for goal himself, something that is reflected in his record of six assists and just two goals in the Championship this season. He ranks ninth in the Championship for assists despite starting only half (14 of 28) of Boro’s games, but jumps up to second when looking at assists per 90 (0.42) among players with at least 1,000 minutes to their name. He is within the Championship’s top 10 players for the season for chances created per 90 (2.6) among the same group of players, while only Leicester’s on-loan Sporting CP winger Abdul Fatawu (1.2) has created more big chances per 90 than him (0.8). Rogers also ranks seventh in the division for expected assists (xA) per 90, with 0.29, and jumps up to third when just looking at open-play expected assists per 90, with the vast majority of his contributions coming in open play (0.28 xA) rather than at dead balls situations. He likes to move play forward by carrying the ball, too, averaging 10.5 carries – moving with the ball at least five metres – per 90 this season, with 5.4 of those deemed ‘progressive’ – moving with the ball at least five metres towards the opposition’s goal, as well as ranking in the top 20 for both dribbles attempted (4.7) and completed (1.7) per 90. He is yet to marry his ball-carrying with end product, though; he has followed up only seven of his 152 carries all season by creating a chance for a teammate. Whenever he gets the opportunity, Rogers will look to play a killer pass, but that eagerness to affect the game is both a strength and a weakness. He wants to play the final pass or make the biggest possible impact whenever he gets on the ball. It speaks to a confidence in a player who impressed so much while playing against Manchester City for West Brom in the FA Youth Cup semi-final in 2019 that City chose to sign him. You want your young players to be confident and to try difficult things that have the potential to be telling, but Rogers gives the ball away slightly too frequently.  He has lost possession on average 18.3 times per 90 minutes played, which puts him in the top 20 in the Championship this season, and means that 34% of his touches lead to him losing the ball. It is natural that attackers complete fewer passes than other players, but his pass success rate of 72.2% is remarkably low given he plays in a possession-dominant team under Carrick. Many of the best players in the world give the ball away often when trying ambitious things – for example, Bruno Fernandes has lost possession more times than any other player in the Premier League this season (430) – but they also produce key contributions more than anyone else. He may have to curb some of those creative instincts when making the step up to Premier League level. He did catch the eye against Chelsea in the EFL Cup semi-final last week, though, and Villa fans will be hoping his well-taken goal, struck from the edge of the box – which took his record in the competition this season to five goals and two assists in five starts and one substitute appearance – is an indication that he has what it takes to make it at the highest level. There is unquestionably plenty of talent there and bags of potential, and Villa have clearly deemed Rogers’ possible improvement worth taking a reasonably expensive risk on.  Don’t expect him to have a huge impact on first-team proceedings too quickly, but Rogers could be one to keep an eye on in the coming years if Villa manage his development well. Enjoy this?

It was ‘only’ a goal against League Two opposition, but Rasmus Højlund’s strike in the 4-2 FA Cup win over Newport County spoke volumes about a frustrating first few months at Manchester United for the Danish striker. His celebration, if you can call it that, was more like a release of pent-up fury and annoyance. There was barely a hint of a smile, rather a reaction that some might perceive as a not-so-subtle message to his teammates. That wouldn’t be a baseless suggestion. His displeasure was plain to see on multiple occasions during Sunday’s largely unimpressive victory. In the first half, Alejandro Garnacho was released into the left side of the box but decided to go for goal from a difficult angle instead of passing into the six-yard box where Højlund was waiting for a tap-in; the Argentina international hit the crossbar but it’s fair to say he made the wrong decision, and Højlund’s reaction, although not directed at his teammate, left little room for misinterpretation. Then, late in the second half, Garnacho again had possession in the left side of the box, but rather than flash a low ball into the danger zone towards Antony and Højlund, he feinted back inside and was instantly dispossessed. This time he received both barrels from Højlund, who gave the winger a real rollicking. So, when Højlund finally got his goal about 13 minutes later in second-half stoppage time, the emotion in his reaction made perfect sense. After all, in some ways that game represented a microcosm of his United career. He worked hard up top and brought others into play well, but a lack of service had him feeding off scraps; even his goal fell into that category, he just happened to be well positioned to pounce when Omari Forson’s effort on the stretch was blocked by the goalkeeper. That strike was Højlund’s only shot of a game in which United had 22, and it took nearly 94 minutes for it to arrive. Antony had six; Bruno Fernandes and Garnacho managed five each; even five Newport players registered at least two attempts, Will Evans and Bryn Morris tallying nine between them. It wouldn’t be right to say Højlund has been faultless this season; he obviously hasn’t. The long wait for his first Premier League goal was excruciating to watch and saw him become synonymous with supposed “lookalike” Sean Millis, the Australian singer whose song ‘Waiting on a Miracle’ went to No. 1 on the UK Viral singles chart largely down to its social media association with Højlund’s woes. However, Sunday’s game was just the latest piece of evidence pointing to his underwhelming productivity in front of goal being at least partly down to those around him. Critics will, of course, urge him to look at his own game, what he might be doing wrong, what he could potentially do better, et cetera. And that is fair, but he – like any good striker – still needs help. At a club like United, the first-choice centre-forward shouldn’t be starved for service. Only two United players have created more than one chance in open play for Højlund in the Premier League this season; Marcus Rashford and Fernandes have each laid on four opportunities to him, though that’s hardly impressive. In fact, there are 93 instances in the Premier League this term of a player creating more chances for an individual teammate, with the most being Mohamed Salah’s 19 for Darwin Núñez. Other United combinations account for five of those 93, with Fernandes to Antony and Fernandes to Garnacho (seven each) their most fruitful in the league, which arguably helps illustrate part of the issue at hand. United are so reliant on the creative talents of Fernandes but his record suggests he looks to the wide players more often. Perhaps that’s out of habit considering they didn’t have a reliable centre-forward at all really last season, when United’s most frequent combinations for shots were Fernandes to Rashford (24, the most in the Premier League) and Fernandes to Antony (17, joint-fifth in the Premier League). So clearly, he and Højlund improving their on-pitch understanding would be a boost. But, as good as Fernandes is, this is where their reliance on him becomes problematic; it’s not just on him to take that responsibility, others need to be creative outlets as well. \\xa0 We can get a better idea of the standard of creativity that Højlund is being served by looking at expected goals (xG) assisted; this looks at the xG total of shots taken following chance-creating passes, thus allowing us to quantify a player’s (or players’) ability to find teammates in dangerous positions. The cumulative xG assisted value of all open-play chance-creating passes to Højlund in the Premier League this season is just 1.30, which, ahead of Matchday 22, is only enough to see him rank joint-93rd in the whole league; even Aston Villa right-back Matt Cash (1.9) is among those higher up. That comes from just 12 chance-creating passes to Højlund from teammates; 26 other strikers have been set up more often than him. In fact, of the 42 strikers to have received at least five chance-creating passes in the top flight, Højlund is one of just four yet to be assisted by a teammate (along with Rodrigo Muniz, Armando Broja and William Osula). However, it was a different story in the UEFA Champions League. Five of Højlund’s eight United goals have come in Europe, and the data points to him being used more often. For instance, the 2.1 xG assisted value of open-play chance-creating passes to him was the fifth highest in the group stage. We have to take into consideration that this was boosted by his tap-in from Scott McTominay’s pass against FC Copenhagen being worth 0.92 xG, but we should also highlight that he was set up for eight open-play opportunities in six matches by teammates in the UCL (1.33 per game) compared to 12 in 16 Premier League games (0.75 per game). One theory as to why Højlund seemed to have greater luck in the Champions League is that United sat back more, placing greater emphasis on being a threat in transition. After all, their PPDA (the average number of passes the opponents are allowed before United engage with a defensive action) was higher in the Champions League (15.2) than domestically (12.5), evidence of less emphasis on a high press in Europe, and they recorded nine fast breaks in the UCL (1.5 per game) compared to 14 in the Premier League (0.66 per game). It’s no mystery why this might suit the deceptively quick Højlund. His second goal in Copenhagen came via a tap-in after Garnacho tore away and had a shot parried; the Dane’s header at home to Galatasaray was at the end of a rapid breakaway with Rashford; and his second in that game arrived after he ran almost half the length of the pitch with the ball, showcasing his athleticism and then subtlety with a smart finish. Nevertheless, United finished bottom of their Champions League group and so won’t be playing European football at all for the rest of the season. It also seems unlikely Erik ten Hag will be making any major tactical alterations between now and the end of the campaign, so it’ll fall on Højlund to take a degree of responsibility for his own output and on-pitch rapport with teammates. So, what more can he do? Some might argue he could drop deep less and spend more time concentrating on his positioning in the area. He’s a hard worker and does a lot of pressing, but the graphic below shows how a significant portion of his pressures occur a long distance from goal.  Considering he averages 16.1 touches per shot, far more than the likes of Erling Haaland (5.5), Callum Wilson (8.4) and Núñez (8.6), focusing those pressures higher up the pitch might be beneficial in terms of his proximity to the area – Bournemouth’s Dominic Solanke recently suggested a tweak like this helped improve his output considerably. In the interest of balance, Højlund is actually making more off-ball runs into the box per 90 minutes (11.1) than all but three strikers (minimum 500 minutes played) in the Premier League this season, significantly more even than Haaland (8.7), so it can’t be said he offers no presence in the area. The problem is, only 35.3% of those are targeted runs (movements that are followed immediately by a teammate attempting a pass), meaning he ranks behind 17 players in that metric; for context, 44.8% (ranked second) of Haaland’s runs into the box are targeted by a teammate. Sacrificing a few touches elsewhere on the pitch might at least improve the odds of United’s other forwards finding Højlund, particularly considering how poor the xG assisted data suggests they’ve been in that respect this term. Still, the emotion and attitude he showed at the weekend could also be a good indicator that he’s starting to take matters into his own hands more, ready to shout up when his needs – and the greater good of the team – aren’t being met. United will hope Højlund’s passion boiling over is a sign of an inner fire that’s starting to emerge; that’s something they can channel, but he can’t do it all on his own.

We take a look at who Liverpool might turn to after the ‘normal one’. The shock has settled, the tears have dried, and the four-month emotional goodbye has begun. Jürgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool at the end of the season, which means the most successful and popular manager in the club’s recent history must be replaced. When Klopp was appointed in 2015, he felt like the obvious choice. He and Carlo Ancelotti were the standout candidates at the time, but Liverpool didn’t just simply go with popular opinion. They insisted it was a decision based on the data, which was obviously in Klopp’s favour from his successful time at Borussia Dortmund having won two Bundesliga titles and reached a Champions League final against all odds. Liverpool’s next selection will also be heavily influenced by data. The club’s CEO Billy Hogan said at Friday’s press conference: “From our perspective, I wouldn’t want to set an expectation [on a timeline for replacing Klopp]. Number one because this is a process we have to go through and have done in the past. The way we operate as a football club is to make sure we look at all the information and all the data, we’ve done our proper due diligence and then make a decision and have an announcement at that time.” Therefore, we thought we’d give Liverpool a bit of a helping hand and look at some of the more notable data around the names being linked with replacing the most popular manager at the club in the modern era. When it was speculated that Klopp’s eventual successor might be a former much-loved midfielder, Steven Gerrard was the Liverpool legend most had in mind. With Xabi Alonso impressing as manager of Bayer Leverkusen, though, it is the Spaniard who leads the betting. Having made over 200 appearances for the club and won the UEFA Champions League and FA Cup at Liverpool as a player, the fanbase seem encouraged by the idea of the 42-year-old returning to Anfield in a managerial capacity. Alonso had already shown his credentials with Real Sociedad B, getting Sanse promoted to the Segunda División for the first time in 59 years before he was appointed by Leverkusen in October 2022. He has an overall Bundesliga record of 45 games managed, 28 wins, 10 draws and seven defeats, though all of those losses came last season, with a win percentage of 62.2%. After taking Leverkusen from fighting relegation to finishing sixth last season, he has developed the team to a sensational extent in 2023-24. They accumulated 45 points in the first half of the season, with a Bundesliga side only ever recording more points by this stage on two occasions – both Bayern Munich (2013-14 and 2015-16). 45 – The best first halves in Bundesliga history:47 points – FC Bayern 2013-1446 points – FC Bayern 2015-1645 points – Bayer 04 Leverkusen 2023-2445 points – FC Bayern 2014-15Statement. #FCAB04 pic.twitter.com/kTDMaCwj8J Saturday saw them drop points in a 0-0 home draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, though there were still signs of how well coached they have been under Alonso. Leverkusen had 69 touches in the Gladbach box, a new record for a team in a Bundesliga match since the start of detailed data collection in 2004-05. It seems unlikely Liverpool would be able to replace Klopp with someone with an identical playing style, but Alonso would be an interesting potential evolution. Leverkusen have made 208 high turnovers (HTs) – winning the ball within 40m of the opposition’s goal – in total in the Bundesliga this season, with 39 shot-ending HTs and four goal-ending HTs. Liverpool have recorded 202 HTs in the Premier League, with 30 shot-ending and three goal-ending. Similar numbers, though Leverkusen have played two fewer league games than Liverpool. While Liverpool have played an intense and high-level counter-attacking style synonymous with Klopp’s teams, they are perhaps a more possession-focused side than some think. In every league campaign under Klopp, Liverpool have averaged at least 58.3% possession, and even managed to record an average of 63.5% in 2019-20 when they won the title. Only three teams in Europe’s top five leagues have averaged more possession than Alonso’s Leverkusen this season (Paris Saint-Germain – 65.6%, Barcelona – 65%, Manchester City – 64.4%). Under the Spanish coach, Leverkusen have increased their average from 51.8% last season to 62.3% this season. Both teams enjoy a progressive pass. Liverpool have averaged 36.2 progressive passes per game this season, more than any other team in the Premier League, while Leverkusen have averaged 35.7, more than any other team in the Bundesliga. A big part of Liverpool’s game is their switches, and they’ve averaged 3.9 per game this season, the second-most in the Premier League behind West Ham (4.4). Leverkusen do not use them as often (2.7 per game) but if Alonso had the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold in his side perhaps he would adapt, or the team would. One of Liverpool’s main strengths has been their ability to win no matter what, hence Klopp labelling them ‘mentality monsters’. Alonso’s Leverkusen have shown similar resoluteness this season, in particular their recent late away wins over Augsburg and RB Leipzig. Die Mentalitätsmonster, indeed. Not only has Roberto De Zerbi impressed in the Premier League over the last two seasons, but he also arguably has a similar on-the-surface passion to Klopp that Liverpool fans would be likely to get behind. De Zerbi is only two years older than Alonso but has over a decade of managerial experience behind him, having taken charge of Italian lower-league side Darfo Boario in November 2013. It was his work at Sassuolo and Shakhtar Donetsk that caught Brighton’s attention before the Seagulls brought him to England to replace Graham Potter in 2022. It was a tricky task considering how successful Potter had been before his departure for Chelsea in the September. Coincidentally, De Zerbi’s first game was at Anfield where his new team gave Liverpool all sorts of problems in a 3-3 draw. Since De Zerbi arrived, only seven Premier League teams have won more games than Brighton (22 out of 53), while only five have lost fewer (16). In that time, only Man City (64.2%) have averaged more possession than Brighton (62.2%) in the Premier League, while only Liverpool (882) have attempted more shots than their 850. This season, only Liverpool (760) and Tottenham (732) have made as many progressive passes as Brighton’s 679 When it comes to high turnovers this season in the league, Brighton have recorded 193, but have been more productive with them than Liverpool, with 37 ending in a shot and six ending in a goal. However, defensive stability might be a concern. Since De Zerbi’s appointment, of ever-present Premier League teams only Nottingham Forest (10) have kept fewer clean sheets than Brighton (11), while only Bournemouth (91), Forest (89), Tottenham (87) and Wolves (82) have conceded more goals than their 81. He does, of course, also know how to get the best out of Alexis Mac Allister. The Argentina international has been playing in an unfamiliar role at the base of midfield for Klopp, though he has been impressing particularly in recent weeks. Similarly to both Alonso and De Zerbi, Rúben Amorim has burst onto the scene in recent years. There were eyebrows raised when Sporting CP paid a significant fee to take the young coach from Braga in 2020, but in his first full season in Lisbon he won the club their first Primeira Liga title in 19 years. With a team that included current Premier League stars Pedro Porro and João Palhinha, Amorim’s Sporting lost just once in their 34 league games, finishing five points ahead of Porto. They have not won the league since but did finish second in 2021-22 and are leading the way this season. Overall, Amorim has taken charge of 132 Primeira Liga games for Sporting, winning 98, drawing 20 and losing 14. Only Porto (W101 D20 L11) have a better record in that time. Sporting have averaged 60.4% possession in the Primeira Liga under Amorim, and they conceded just 20 and 23 goals in his first two full seasons in charge at Estádio José Alvalade. That rose to 32 last season as they finished fourth, but although they have already conceded 19 after 19 games this campaign, they have scored a whopping 53. That has been in part thanks to the 15 goals of Viktor Gyökeres, whose impact we recently looked at. They hammered Casa Pia 8-0 on Monday and sit top of the league on 49 points from 19 games. Amorim is a name routinely linked with so-called ‘bigger jobs’ thanks to his achievements in Lisbon, and it likely won’t be long before someone takes a chance on him. Klopp insists he will take at least a year off once he departs Anfield, but he will inevitably be strongly linked to the Germany national team job given Julian Nagelsmann is only contracted until the end of Euro 2024. That, of course, also means Nagelsmann will be available this summer and that could pique Liverpool’s interest if they fancy another highly-rated German coach. The youngest on an already very young shortlist, the 36-year-old still has quite the CV. Nagelsmann made his name at Hoffenheim where he was appointed when he was just 28. After saving them from relegation from the Bundesliga in his first season, he led Hoffenheim to a fourth-place finish in his second. It was actually Klopp’s Liverpool who beat them in the Champions League qualifiers the following campaign. He moved to RB Leipzig and guided them to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019-20, before finishing second in the Bundesliga the following season. That convinced Bayern Munich to move for him, and he won his first Bundesliga title there in 2021-22. He was sacked the following March with Bayern a point behind Dortmund at the top of the table, before taking the Germany job to try and improve their fortunes ahead of their home Euros tournament in the summer of 2024. But would he suit Liverpool? Nagelsmann had a win percentage in the Bundesliga of 44% at Hoffenheim, 54.4% at Leipzig and 66.1% at Bayern, so he seems able to scale up with little problem. That was also true with his team’s average possession, which in the Bundesliga was 52.9% at Hoffenheim, 57.5% at Leipzig and 64.7% at Bayern.  In terms of progressive passes, in his title season at Bayern they averaged 46.9 per game, the most in the Bundesliga by a distance, while only Stuttgart (150) completed more successful switches than their 115. The downside would be his work couldn’t officially start until late in the summer due to his Euros commitments, but Nagelsmann’s name will still likely be in Liverpool’s thinking over the next few weeks and months. Well-respected Danish coach Thomas Frank has the most Premier League experience on this list, which could count in his favour. After a couple of years as assistant coach at Brentford, he was promoted to the big gig in 2018 and has been there ever since. As another club who are big proponents of following the data with their decision-making, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Liverpool take a look at Brentford, and it would be difficult not to be impressed by Frank’s achievements to date. He took Brentford to the Championship play-off final in 2019-20, losing to Fulham, only to reach the final again a year later and this time oversee a 2-0 win over Swansea to take the Bees into the Premier League for the first time. Not only that, but he has established Brentford as a top-flight team since, with 13th- and 9th-place finishes. One issue is that Frank’s side do not really play anything like Liverpool currently do. They’re far from a long-ball team but they’re much less reliant on passes and possession. Only seven Premier League teams have attempted fewer passes this season, while 10 have a higher average possession percentage than their 48.7% and 10 have made more progressive passes than their 562. In terms of high turnovers, they have made just 161 in the league, with 25 shot-ending and one goal-ending. That could change with the return of Ivan Toney, though it might also be a concern how much Brentford appear to have struggled without their star man. Prior to their 3-2 win in his comeback game, they had lost eight of their previous 10 games in all competitions (W1 D1). Brentford do attempt a high number of switches, though as you can see below, they are not as successful with them as Liverpool, especially the higher up the pitch they try them. It would be a big step up for Frank and he is arguably the outside bet of this list, but like Amorim, you feel at some stage a bigger club than Brentford will see if his skills can scale up. This is a gigantic decision for Liverpool and will likely need to wait until a new sporting director is installed, but with the club having known about Klopp’s departure since November, they will have already been doing their research and crunching the numbers over the last three months.  Whether it is one of the above or an outside shout, they will have a tough job to follow Klopp. The new manager will need the character to lead as well as to put up with the inevitable comparisons.  Winning games will win hearts, though, and Liverpool fans will hope they will be allowed to just reminisce about the glory years of Klopp in the future, rather than cite it as where things peaked.

I already knew it. But it’s time to make it public. I think the players could not free themselves up. I don’t want to be a problem for the club, but a solution.” At the end of last season, the situation at Barcelona had – on the pitch at least – looked pretty rosy. Club legend Xavi had led the club back to La Liga’s summit for their first title in four years, the squad had been refreshed into what appeared to be the right blend of youth and experience, and the future looked bright. The team had put widely reported financial problems to one side and retuned to domestic glory. But only six months on, the outlook is rather different. Fourth in the table, 11 points off top spot, out of the Copa del Rey and surely in with no chance of winning the Champions League, manager Xavi has announced his departure. With fellow Barça stalwarts Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba having left in the summer on free transfers, Xavi’s exit signals the end of an era, leaving Sergi Roberto and Marc-André ter Stegen as the only remaining members of the 2015 treble-winning squad. Now seems like the ideal time for a hard reset, as their soon-to-depart manager explained. “I think the club needs a change of dynamic,” said Xavi. “For the good of the players, I believe that they will free themselves.” Barcelona’s problems obviously run far deeper than results, but that won’t mean there isn’t a lot of interest in the position. This is one of the most sought-after jobs in world football, after all. However, quite what they need right now is up for debate. They usually go for someone with deep links to the club – someone who possesses the ‘Barcelona DNA’ that is so important to them – but that naturally severely limits their options. And one of those options is already out of the running. Mikel Arteta has distanced himself from a return to the club at which he came through the youth ranks in the late 1990s. It was reported in Spain over the weekend that the Arsenal manager was considering stepping down at the end of the season, and that he was open to going back to Barcelona. But being a very good manager, having links with the club and promoting the ‘right’ kind of football clearly aren’t enough alone. “That is totally fake news,” Arteta said. “What you read, I’m really upset about it. I couldn’t believe it. It has no sources. I’m in the right place [at Arsenal] with the right people and feel really good about it.” So, with Arteta – the early bookies’ favourite – firmly out of contention, who are the realistic options to be Barcelona’s next manager? With no obvious answer to their problems, there are a huge range of managers to consider. Do they go for someone who knows the club and the fans already love, or do they take this opportunity to take a break from the norm – maybe Barcelona need to prioritise pragmatism with their next managerial choice? Here, we run through some of the best and most high-profile options as the new Barcelona manager. Surely not, right? Klopp did leave the door open to taking another job when he announced last week that he would be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season, but the general theme to his resignation statement was that he had run out of steam. The Barcelona job is notoriously taxing. When Pep Guardiola quit in 2012, he used the words “draining”, “tiring”, “very high demand” and “eternity” to describe his four years in the job. More than decade on, his former captain used similar language. “From a mental health level, it’s tough too,” Xavi said. “I am a positive guy, but the battery levels keep running out – and at some point, you realise there’s no point in staying.” In many ways, the Barcelona job suits Klopp, most notably in that he would be taking over a sleeping giant with huge potential for improvement. He was appointed as Borussia Dortmund manager after they had finished 13th in the Bundesliga in 2007-08, and eventually led them to back-to-back titles, and then was made Liverpool manager a few months after a sixth-place finish in 2014-15, before winning everything there is to win at Anfield. The chance to return Barcelona to their former glories must appeal… just maybe not as much as a few years off. It is very much the Barcelona way to appoint one of their own – hence the early links to Arteta – so it would be no surprise were they to promote former player Rafa Márquez from his current position as Barcelona B manager. Having last season led the team to the promotion play-off semi-final – where they lost to rival counterparts Real Madrid 5-4 on aggregate – Márquez has impressed in a short managerial career so far. He knows the club and knows what the hierarchy would want from him. He would be a good option to continue the work Xavi has done, too, but given this would be the 44-year-old’s first job in senior management, his appointment would be a real risk. He would, however, be the cheap option and right now that has to appeal. Las Palmas manager García Pimienta is Barcelona born and bred. After spending nearly three decades in the Barcelona youth system as a player and then coach, he was seen by many in the club as capable and worthy of making the step up to first-team level. But president Joan Laporta did not feel the same, removing Pimienta from his position in charge of Barcelona B shortly after coming into power in 2021. A couple of years on, Pimienta’s work on the Canary Islands surely must have made Laporta sit up and wonder if he’d made a huge mistake. Pimienta took over with Las Palmas in mid-table in the Segunda División in January 2022. In the next season, he led them to promotion, and now, two years on from his appointment, Las Palmas are in contention for a European place in La Liga, and playing some of the top flight’s most eye-catching football. Only Barcelona (65.0%) and Real Madrid (59.1%) are averaging more possession in Spain’s top tier this season than Las Palmas (57.8%). They rank fourth for the total number of sequences they have put together involving at least 10 passes (319), and fifth for the number of those attacks that end in a shot or touch in the opposition box (46). They are dominating games and territory in a way that promoted sides simply aren’t supposed to. They are also defending on the front foot, with the third-lowest PPDA (passes per defensive action) rate in La Liga this season, allowing their opponents 10.6 passes for every attempt they make to win the ball. They rank behind only Champions League sides Real Sociedad (9.0) and, interestingly, Barcelona (9.4). Plenty are naturally wondering what Pimienta could do with greater resources, but there will be others who think a step up to Barcelona at this stage could be too soon for him. The thing is, if Barcelona don’t go for him, someone else probably will. One team impressing even more than Las Palmas this season is table-topping, Girona, who lead the way and are dreaming of a title win as improbable as Leicester City’s Premier League success in 2016. Míchel promotes a front-footed, possession-heavy style of play. His side are the league’s top scorers with 52 goals in 22 games, and are passing opponents off the park week in, week out. They have lost only one league game in 2023-24. They build their attacks in a slower and more deliberate way than any other team in La Liga, moving up the pitch at an average speed of 1.6 metres/second, while only Real Madrid (4.9) and Barcelona (4.6) average more passes per sequence than them (4.3). Only Madrid (114), meanwhile, have constructed more attacks with at least 10 passes that end in a shot or a touch in the opposition’s box than Girona (87). The vast majority of their goals are scored in open play – they have scored at least six more such goals than any other team in La Liga (44) – and Míchel has also built an incredible team spirit. His side have won more points from losing positions (22) than any other team this season. All this when Girona were in the second tier only two seasons ago; Míchel is doing a genuinely sensational job.  The Barcelona faithful would have to find a way to get past one thing were he to be appointed, though. Míchel was born in and grew up playing football in Madrid. A principle-over-pragmatism manager who may appeal to anyone who thinks the next appointment doesn’t necessarily need to ooze Barcelona ‘DNA’, Nagelsmann was only appointed Germany manager in September, but after ultimately failing in his last job – at Bayern Munich – he may find the lure of a club like Barcelona too great to ignore. The fact that his contract only runs until the end of this summer’s Euro 2024 tournament suggests he isn’t planning on sticking around too long. He would be able to play the possession-heavy football that is a non-negotiable for any Barcelona manager, but would also bring entertainment. After leading RB Leipzig to third and second in the Bundesliga as well as the Champions League semi-finals and the DFB-Pokal final in his two seasons in charge, Nagelsmann won the league title with his Bayern side racking up the fifth-highest goals total (97) by any team in Bundesliga history. Their 92 goals excluding own goals came from a whopping 89.9 xG. He has a point to prove and would be a break from the norm for Barcelona, so in many ways while he is the wrong fit, he feels like a good fit for now. If you were to describe the perfect Barcelona manager, Xavi would fit the bill. He learned the game in the Barcelona youth system, was a legend for them as a player, is a huge name and the fans would know he wanted to play football that they would enjoy watching. If they wanted to try to repeat the trick they could turn to Fàbregas, who of course played with Xavi in those legendary Barcelona and Spain teams. Fàbregas is making his first steps into coaching as assistant manager of Italian Serie B side Como, and having played under some of the greatest managers the game has ever seen, he has had a footballing education that should set him up to succeed as a coach. It is almost certainly too soon for him to become Barcelona manager, but don’t bet against it happening sometime in the future. A Brazilian-born Italy international who signed for Barcelona aged 17, Motta was part of the team that won back-to-back titles in 2004-05 and 2005-06 and the Champions League, so he is liked by the fans, and he also knows the club well. Now impressing as Bologna manager, his name has been mentioned as an option for the vacant Barcelona position. He places great importance on the use of third-man combinations – something Xavi has spoken about publicly before. Motta is from the very same footballing school. He has transformed Bologna into a possession-based side (55.2% – third highest in Serie A in 2023-24) while moving them up the table and into European contention. A recent run of four games without a win has seen them slide down the league a little, but they are still only three points off the top four and still very much in with a chance of Champions League qualification.  Under Motta, Bologna are edging closer and closer towards the slow-and-intricate end of the scale on our team style comparison graphic. Motta is still only 41 and clearly has plenty of learning to do, but it isn’t difficult to imagine him being Barcelona manager one day. The people’s choice. Given there really is no stand-out candidate for the job, many fans are yearning for Pep Guardiola’s return. Is there any chance he would leave City right now, though? Klopp’s departure from Liverpool could encourage Guardiola to take a break, too. Or he could see it as an opportunity to win the Premier League title more easily for the next few years while Liverpool reboot. Having built one of the greatest teams of all time in the shape of that Barcelona team of 2008-2012, no data is needed to establish whether Guardiola would be a good fit. The question is simply whether he wants to go back. The job would be his if he wanted it.  There are so many others who have been linked with the job, including Antonio Conte, José Mourinho, Marcelo Gallardo, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde, Hansi Flick, Thomas Tuchel, Roberto De Zerbi and Xabi Alonso. The range in the type of manager and style on this page shows just how up in the air Barcelona’s future is.  It’s a huge call, and the club’s hierarchy have half a year to mull it over. The consequences of their decision will be felt for a whole lot longer. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Here’s our Wolves vs Manchester United prediction and preview for the Premier League clash. Struggling away from home and yet to make any inroads in the January transfer market, Erik ten Hag will be desperate for a positive result to start the month as Manchester United visit Wolves at Molineux on Thursday in the Premier League. United had little reason for Christmas celebration after being knocked out of the UEFA Champions League group stage alongside disappointing Premier League losses to Bournemouth, West Ham United and Nottingham Forest amid a troubling December. Those festive struggles did not entirely transpire into January blues, though, with United beating lowly Wigan Athletic and Newport County in the FA Cup third and fourth rounds respectively either side of a 2-2 league draw with top-four chasing Tottenham at Old Trafford. Rasmus Højlund and Marcus Rashford twice put Ten Hag’s hosts ahead in the Matchday 21 clash with Spurs, only for Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur to score equalisers as United delivered yet another performance as exciting as frustrating in equal parts. The Red Devils sit eighth in the league table heading into MD 22, some 11 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa and five further behind Premier League leaders Liverpool. That league-table position has not forced Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS, or any other of the United shareholders, to invest yet this month. The Old Trafford club have been linked to Newcastle United’s Callum Wilson and Bayern Munich’s Eric Choupo-Moting to fill the void left by Anthony Martial’s groin injury that’ll keep him out until April, removing any support for inexperienced Danish forward Højlund, who continues to slowly find his feet in the Premier League. Rashford is also encouragingly returning to form but his availability remains unclear – if the latter is welcomed back after missing the Newport triumph following “an internal matter” that Ten Hag promised to “deal with”. The England forward, who missed training this week due to ‘illness’ but was pictured reportedly partying in Belfast, has scored (two) or assisted (one) in each of his last three Premier League appearances – against Aston Villa, Forest and Tottenham – as many goal involvements as in his first 17 games this term (two goals, one assist). Ten Hag’s lineup will at least be boosted by the returning Casemiro, Lisandro Martínez, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw, all of whom featured in the 4-2 victory over Newport on Sunday. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were on target in that win before Antony and Højlund ensured victory following a comeback from the League Two hosts. Victor Lindelöf, Mason Mount and Tyrell Malacia all remain out, however, while Morocco’s Sofyan Amrabat is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, where André Onana could return after Cameroon were eliminated on Saturday night by Nigeria. United haven’t lost a Premier League game in the month of February since 2018 (1-0 vs Newcastle), going unbeaten in their last 22 such games since then (W13 D9), but Wolves’ excellent recent form should be noted. Since the start of MD 15, only league-leading Liverpool (17) have amassed more Premier League points than Wolves (14 – W4 D2 L1), who have been inspired in recent weeks by Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian forward has been directly involved in seven goals across his last six home appearances in all competitions, scoring and assisting in each of his last two at Molineux – against Everton in the Premier League and Brentford in the FA Cup. Cunha missed a glorious opportunity in Wolves’ last league outing, though, as Gary O’Neil’s men managed a goalless draw away to Brighton and Hove Albion, leaving the west Midlands club 11th in the league table after MD 21 but trailing Man United by just three points. It has been a much-needed return to form for O’Neil’s side, winning three straight Premier League games – against Chelsea, Brentford and Everton – before the Brighton draw and defeating Black Country rivals West Bromwich Albion 2-0 in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday. Pedro Neto and Cunha scored in that derby-day victory, which was marred by crowd disturbances that led to the game temporarily being suspended at the Hawthorns. As for O’Neil’s lineup, Wolves remain without the suspended João Gomes, while Boubacar Traoré is at AFCON and Hwang Hee-Chan continues competing at the AFC Asian Cup. Pablo Sarabia missed the West Brom victory with a calf issue but could return for Thursday, as Rayan Aït-Nouri did in the FA Cup fourth-round victory after coming back from international duty with Algeria. Manchester United opened their 2023-24 Premier League season up with a 1-0 win over Wolves at Old Trafford on Matchday 1. Despite coming away with nothing, Wolves’ performance was excellent and they would have been aggrieved to have not taken at least a point. They attempted 23 shots in the 1-0 loss in August, which has only been bettered once in the Premier League by an away side at Old Trafford on record (25 by Chelsea in November 2005), while they had more touches in the opposition penalty area (48) than any other away side at Man Utd in the Premier League since the start of 2008-09. O’Neil will hope the hosts can find a way to atone for his woeful record against United, seeing his sides lose all three of their Premier League encounters with the Red Devils without scoring a single goal (twice with Bournemouth last term and on MD 1 this season with Wolves), while as a player he only lost more games against Chelsea (15) than he did against Man Utd in the competition (10/14). It is not just O’Neil who has struggled. Wolves have lost six of their last seven Premier League meetings with Manchester United (W1), losing the last three without scoring a single goal. Indeed, having won just two of their first six Premier League away games against Wolves (D1 L3), United have now won each of their last three visits to Molineux, including a 1-0 win in this fixture last season as Rashford scored the only goal. The England international, who has been the topic of much discussion this week, has two Premier League goals against Wolves with both being assisted by Fernandes in 1-0 victories (December 2020 and December 2022). Ten Hag must find a way to improve United’s away form, losing three of their last four Premier League away games (D1) and scoring just one goal across these four outings against Forest, West Ham, Liverpool and Newcastle. United failed to lead for a single minute in any of those last four away games, while coming into this round of matches, only 20th-placed Sheffield United (100 minutes) and 18th-placed Luton Town (223 minutes) have spent less time ahead in Premier League games this season than Ten Hag’s men. Visitors United could lose three successive away league matches for the first time since a run of seven from March to August 2022 and Molineux has proved a stern task for many this term. Having lost their first two home Premier League games of 2023-24 (vs Brighton and Liverpool), Wolves have since gone unbeaten in eight (W5 D3). Only once previously have they enjoyed a longer run without defeat at Molineux in the competition (a run of 10 ending in August 2019). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. This is expected to be the tightest Matchday 22 encounter, with the Opta supercomputer struggling to separate the two sides at Molineux. Manchester United triumphed in 39.7% of 10,000 data-led simulations, with Wolves winning 30.6% and the game ending as a draw in 29.7%. United’s top-four hopes have dropped to 0.6% in Opta’s end-of-season predictions, with their most likely finish as ninth (17.1%) – one below their current league-table position – while Wolves appear set to stay 11th with a 21% chance of doing so.

Will the Irons stretch their unbeaten run to six Premier League matches? It often feels like debates over David Moyes’ position at West Ham will never go away, but a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League has the Hammers dreaming of Europe again. They enter Matchday 22 sixth in the table, five points adrift of fifth-placed Tottenham. How will they fare against Bournemouth, who are looking to rediscover their momentum after back-to-back losses? Across all teams’ last 10 Premier League matches, only Liverpool (24) have earned more points than West Ham’s 21, with Moyes’ men recording six wins in that time, drawing three times and losing once. However, there has been a feeling among sections of the Hammers’ fanbase, partly fuelled by their recent FA Cup exit at the hands of Bristol City, that the team’s performances are underwhelming. West Ham have 35 points, compared to 24 in Opta’s expected points model. Their 11-point negative differential is the biggest any side has between actual points and expected points this season. They were frustrated last time out as Sheffield United twice fought back in the teams’ feisty 2-2 draw at Bramall Lane. Maxwel Cornet and James Ward-Prowse netted for West Ham, only for Oli McBurnie to score the Blades’ second equaliser from the penalty spot 13 minutes into stoppage time after he was fouled by Alphonse Areola. It was the latest Premier League goal scored since records began in 2006-07. Moyes will have been irritated by the way West Ham let their hosts back into that game after Rhian Brewster’s red card gave them a numerical advantage. Vladimír Coufal made it 10-versus-10 by picking up two quickfire yellow cards late on, and he will be banned for Thursday’s game as a result.\\xa0Saïd Benrahma is also suspended following his red card against Bristol City, while Lucas Paquetá is still sidelined. However, West Ham could receive a huge boost with forward Mohammed Kudus returning from international duty following Ghana’s exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, while Michail Antonio is closing in on a return after over two months on the sidelines with a knee injury. The return of Kudus, in particular, could be key for a side that excels on the counter attack. Only Nottingham Forest (seven) have scored more goals from fast breaks in the Premier League this season than West Ham’s six, which have come from three different players with Ward-Prowse, Kudus and Jarrod Bowen each netting two apiece. Bournemouth, meanwhile, are looking to respond to back-to-back Premier League defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. The Cherries did return to winning ways in the FA Cup last Thursday, routing Championship side Swansea City 5-0 with Lloyd Kelly, Alex Scott, Luis Sinisterra, David Brooks and Dominic Solanke all scoring before half-time. That represented their biggest margin of victory in the FA Cup since November 1986, when they beat Fareham Town 7-2 in the first round as a third-tier side. The Cherries have come a long way since then, and with boss Andoni Iraola finding his feet after a tricky start to life in England, they are just four points adrift of the top half with a game in hand. Between 28 October (when Bournemouth earned their first Premier League win of the season against Burnley) and the start of Matchday 22, only Liverpool (28) and Aston Villa (24) bettered their return of 22 points. Key to their revival has been the form of Solanke, who has 12 Premier League goals this campaign. Only Joshua King in 2016-17 (16) and Callum Wilson in 2018-19 (14) have ever scored more in a single top-flight campaign for Bournemouth. Tyler Adams and Hamed Traorè are long-term absentees, but Iraola’s only new injury concern is regarding young full-back James Hill, who came off with an ankle problem against Swansea. One area of concern for the Cherries could be dead-ball situations. Excluding penalties, only Forest (11) have conceded more goals from set-pieces than Bournemouth’s nine in the Premier League this season. West Ham’s Ward-Prowse, meanwhile, has created more chances from set-pieces than any other player this term (28). West Ham have won three of their last four Premier League games against Bournemouth (drawing the other), having been winless in six against them before this run began (three draws, three losses). The two teams played out a 1-1 draw on the south coast back on MD 1, with Solanke scoring a late equaliser to salvage a point for Bournemouth after Bowen put West Ham ahead. The Cherries have endured contrasting fortunes on recent trips to West Ham, going unbeaten through their three away Premier League games against them when scoring (two wins, one draw), but losing their last two when failing to net. Bournemouth were thrashed 4-0 at the London Stadium back in January 2020, and lost 2-0 in this exact fixture last season as Kurt Zouma joined Benrahma on the scoresheet for the Irons. West Ham’s current run of five Premier League games without defeat (three wins, two draws) is their longest such streak within a single season since January 2021, when they enjoyed a six-match unbeaten run. However, after seeing fixtures against Brighton and Hove Albion and Sheffield United finish all square, they could draw three successive league games for the first time since April 2017. Moyes’ men are a tough nut to crack at the London Stadium, where they have kept three successive Premier League clean sheets against Wolves, Manchester United and Brighton. They last managed four straight top-flight clean sheets at home under Gianfranco Zola between December 2009 and January 2010. Bournemouth, meanwhile, were unbeaten in seven games – winning six – before their back-to-back losses to Spurs and Liverpool. During that seven-match unbeaten run, Iraola’s side conceded just five goals and scored at least twice in every match. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: The Opta supercomputer makes West Ham favourites for Thursday’s game, with the Hammers winning 54.9% of 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of kick-off. Bournemouth claim three points in 19.8% of scenarios, while 25.3% of simulations finish level. In the Opta supercomputer’s season predictions, West Ham are favoured to secure European qualification again for 2024-25. They finish sixth in a league-high 24.2% of scenarios, claiming a top-seven place in 59.5% of our projections. Twelfth (23.5%) is Bournemouth’s most common position in our predictions, with the Cherries given a 21.7% chance of finishing inside the top half. Enjoy this?

Our latest edition includes numbers on the FA Cup and the Premier League. After having Premier League football here, there, and everywhere in December, January has been a relative drought of English top-flight action. With FA Cup, EFL Cup and the winter break, there have been just 12 Premier League games in January so far, but don’t worry; plenty more are on the way. Tuesday saw the start of a midweek set of fixtures as the title race and relegation battle continue, and we’re going to see who has the hardest and easiest upcoming run of games over the next few weeks. The magic of the FA Cup was well and truly on show at the weekend as plucky Manchester United overcame the irresistible force of Newport County… oh sorry, we mean Maidstone United managed to beat Ipswich Town. The achievement was incredible, the stats were even more so, and we’ll take a look at some of them right now. If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week.  On your 2024 bingo card we bet you didn’t have ‘Ed Sheeran’s weekend is ruined by former Wolves left-back George Elokobi’. That’s what happened on Saturday though as Elokobi’s Maidstone United remarkably beat Ipswich 2-1 at Portman Road to advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup. An incredible achievement from the National League South (sixth tier) side, especially to beat Kieran McKenna’s in-form Ipswich on their home turf, something only previously achieved this season by Leeds United and Fulham. Unsurprisingly, the Championship outfit dominated in terms of chances. Their 38 shots produced just one goal, though, while Maidstone’s two shots came with a 100% conversion rate. Only one game in English football has matched that chasm in difference for shots this season, which was Sheppey United hosting Walsall in the first round of the FA Cup. The League Two side had 39 shots to just three from their Isthmian League opponents, though did run out 4-1 winners. In fact, there is no game in English football on record where a team that has taken at least 36 more shots than their opponent has lost, though Plymouth Argyle were beaten 3-2 by Dagenham and Redbridge in League Two in April 2016 despite having had 30 more attempts at goal (36-6). Liverpool had to rely on penalties to beat Carlisle United in September 2015 in the League Cup after a 1-1 draw despite having 52 more shots than their opponents (58-6), though that included 30 minutes of extra-time. In the Premier League in January 2014, Chelsea were forced to settle for a 0-0 draw against West Ham despite having 39 shots against their London rivals, who themselves managed just one effort all game. Maidstone’s achievement will go down in history, and though they weren’t rewarded with a fifth-round tie against Premier League opposition, will probably fancy their chances of repeating their feat against either Sheffield Wednesday or Coventry City. We’ll keep an eye out for that, as well as Sheeran’s new album, titled: ‘Jammy Jammy Maidstone’. We’re a few games into the second half of the season and the Premier League is shaping up nicely. Liverpool and Manchester City are threatening to make it another classic race for the title, while Arsenal, Aston Villa and Tottenham will still hold out hope of muscling their way in. The relegation fight is also hotting up, with the three promoted sides still making up the bottom trio, but Luton in particular are close to dragging Everton, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace into the dark places of the Premier League. Who is likeliest to rack up the points over the next few weeks, then? We’ve looked at the fixture difficulty for each team based on the placing of their upcoming opponents in the Opta Power Rankings. Brentford have Ivan Toney back, which is just as well seeing as they have the toughest run of games coming up. They face Man City, Spurs and Liverpool in the next five games. In fact, thanks to their re-arranged game from December, they actually face City twice. Burnley may find it difficult to improve their survival hopes as they also play City and Liverpool as well as Arsenal, while Everton could get dragged into the relegation zone given they have the fourth-toughest run coming up. Man City and Liverpool are among those with a simpler-looking fixture list, though Jürgen Klopp’s men will no longer be hosting Luton on the final weekend of February due to their participation in the EFL Cup final. The supposed ‘easiest’ run of games belongs to Brighton, who face four of the bottom six in their next five. In the Championship, new Swansea boss Luke Williams has his work cut out with the hardest run of games coming up, while bottom side Rotherham will need to drastically improve their performances to not be left even further adrift. Ipswich may be able to console themselves after their shock FA Cup loss with a run of games seen as the third-easiest in England’s second tier, while Blackburn apparently have the simplest. Things other than Maidstone’s win happened in the FA Cup fourth round, with enough ammo for us to tease your brain for another week.

Here’s our Aston Villa vs Newcastle United prediction and preview. Aston Villa remain the unlikely challengers for the Premier League title – or at least UEFA Champions League qualification – as they prepare for Tuesday’s clash at Villa Park against out-of-sorts Newcastle United, who were a similar surprise package last season. Unai Emery has transformed Villa’s fortunes this term, with his side sitting level on points with Arsenal and Manchester City – the latter of whom have a game in hand – and trailing top-flight leaders Liverpool by five points after Matchday 21. That gap to Jürgen Klopp’s side would be smaller if Villa did not share the spoils with Everton on MD 21 in a result that marked Emery’s first ever Premier League goalless draw in his 97th game in charge. However, only once has Emery seen his side fail to score in consecutive Premier League matches, with the Villans losing 1-0 to both Manchester United and Wolves in April/May last season. Villa were held to a goalless draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night. Robin Olsen returned to fitness for that clash as he took his place on the bench, though Jacob Ramsey, Lucas Digne, Pau Torres and Jhon Durán remain sidelined. Emery’s lineup also continues without long-term absentees Tyrone Mings and Emiliano Buendía. Bertrand Traoré is another away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Burkina Faso, though Emery will call upon the ever-reliant Ollie Watkins in attack. Watkins has been involved in nine goals in his last eight Premier League home appearances, scoring five and assisting four. His next goal will be his 50th in the Premier League, just the third Villa player to reach the milestone after Gabriel Agbonlahor (74) and Dwight Yorke (60), and the England striker will fancy his chances after scoring twice in this fixture last term. On the topic of last campaign, Newcastle will likely be looking on with regret after seeing Villa enjoy a similar season to the St. James’ Park side in 2022-23, when the Magpies finished fourth in the league table to secure UEFA Champions League football. That impressive campaign appears somewhat of a distant memory for Eddie Howe, whose 10th-place side have lost their last four league games, against Luton Town, Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Manchester City. There may be some Newcastle confidence taken from defeating fierce rivals Sunderland and Fulham in the third and fourth rounds of the FA Cup respectively, though their league form remains a concern. Since beating Manchester United at the start of December, with what was their seventh win in 10 Premier League games, no side has taken fewer points than the Magpies’ three (W1 L6). That woeful spell can somewhat be apportioned to injury issues, with Nick Pope, Joe Willock, Elliot Anderson, Harvey Barnes, Callum Wilson and Matt Targett as long-term absentees. Howe’s lineup for Tuesday could at least see Jacob Murphy return following Tino Livramento coming back in the 2-0 win over Fulham on Friday, though the Magpies were dealt another blow last week. Already without the suspended Sandro Tonali due to his ban, Newcastle confirmed this week that influential midfielder Joelinton will not return until May after undergoing surgery for a thigh injury suffered against Sunderland earlier in January. Howe’s men were without that ever-growing list of injured stars on MD 21, in which they were undone by Kevin De Bruyne‘s brilliance in a 3-2 defeat against Man City. The Belgian came off the bench to cancel out Anthony Gordon’s strike before setting up Oscar Bobb’s late winner at St. James’ Park. \\xa0 Alexander Isak, who had earlier restored parity against Pep Guardiola’s defending champions after Bernardo Silva’s inventive opener past Martin Dúbravka, has scored in each of Newcastle’s last three Premier League games but ended on the losing side every time. No player has ever scored in four successive appearances in the Premier League while losing each one. Emery’s side have made Villa Park a fortress and their record against Newcastle is also very good. They have gone unbeaten in their last six Premier League home games with the Magpies, winning the last four in a row while keeping a clean sheet each time (W4 D2). Jacob Ramsey was on the scoresheet along with Ollie Watkins (2) as the Villa Park hosts won 3-0 in this exact fixture last season. In fact, you must go all the way back to September 2013 for the last time Villa lost at home to Newcastle – a 2-1 defeat as Hatem Ben Arfa scored one and assisted another. Newcastle have not completed a Premier League double over Villa since that same 2013-14 season but have the chance here after winning 5-1 in the first game of 2023-24 at St. James’ Park. Alexander Isak scored twice in the opening-day demolition, with Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Callum Wilson also netting as Moussa Diaby’s 11th-minute equaliser was rendered meaningless. Newcastle’s hopes of a rare double over Villa appear slim given they have lost each of their last four Premier League games – against Manchester City, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Luton Town – conceding at least three goals in each defeat apart from the Hatters loss. That run is the Magpies’ longest league losing streak since January 2021 (run of five), while not since December 1965 have they conceded three or more goals in four straight league fixtures – an unwanted record that Howe will desperately hope to avoid. A turgid spell for Newcastle will likely not improve at Villa Park, however, where Villa have won 16 of their last 17 Premier League home games (D1), since going down 4-2 against Arsenal last February. Villa have been behind for just 43 minutes in Premier League home games this season, with only Manchester City trailing less at home (three minutes). Meanwhile, only four sides have been ahead for fewer minutes in away games this term than Newcastle (136). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Overcoming Villa’s home form will be a tough ask and that is reflected in the Opta supercomputer’s pre-match predictions, with Villa winning 42.5% of 10,000 simulations. Newcastle must arrest their poor away form but triumphed in just 29.1% of the data-led scenarios, with a draw appearing just as likely in 28.4%. In the end-of-season Opta simulations, Villa’s top-four hopes sit at 70.2% but their title chance is ranked at just 0.9%, behind Manchester City (59.5%), Liverpool (36.5%) and Arsenal (2.9%). Meanwhile, Newcastle are backed to finish eighth – two spots above their current league-table position – in 17.8%. Enjoy this?

Everton may have thought Premier League relegation fears were easing after four straight wins in December but they are back flirting with Championship football next season again ahead of Tuesday’s visit to Fulham at Craven Cottage. Sean Dyche’s side rallied in response to their 10-point deduction, which the club have appealed, for breaches of Premier League financial and sustainability rulings after beating Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Burnley in a spirited pre-Christmas run. However, Everton – who could face further penalties from the league after being charged again recently along with Forest – sit just one point above 18th-placed Luton Town heading into Matchday 22 after defeats against Tottenham, Manchester City and Wolves before a goalless draw with Aston Villa in their last league outing at Goodison Park. Jordan Pickford was impressive in the Matchday 21 draw with Unai Emery’s in-form Villa, keeping a league-high seventh clean sheet of the season. The England goalkeeper will expect another tough examination at Craven Cottage on Tuesday, although Fulham have failed to score in nine different Premier League games this term – the most by any side in the competition. Pickford leading the shutout charts may make people think Dyche’s side are just sitting deep and putting up the barricades but only Tottenham (214) have made more high turnovers than Everton (208) in the Premier League this season, showing they are defending high up the pitch as well as protecting their own penalty area. There are some principles that Dyche will not throw away in the modern-day game, however, with 33% of Everton’s Premier League goals this season coming from corners (8/24), the highest share in the division. The Toffees keep it simple for their impressive set-piece returns. Just one of their 99 corners so far this term has been taken short, fewer than any other Premier League side. As for the visitors’ team news, Ashley Young and Séamus Coleman will likely return, albeit not straight into Dyche’s lineup after injury. Dele Alli and Abdoulaye Doucouré remain out, while Idrissa Gueye is still away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. André Gomes also missed Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Luton in the FA Cup fourth round at Goodison Park with an injury. Fulham are seven points clear of Tuesday’s opponents but are on a run of just one win in five Premier League games after beating Arsenal but losing against Newcastle, Burnley, Bournemouth and Chelsea. The latest defeat to their west London rivals at Stamford Bridge on Matchday 21 was tinged with frustration after Chelsea right-back Malo Gusto was fortunate to avoid a red card for a lunge on Willian before Cole Palmer’s penalty proved the difference. Marco Silva’s side were also eliminated from the EFL Cup semi-finals by Liverpool as a 1-1 draw on Wednesday at Craven Cottage sent Jürgen Klopp’s side into the final with Chelsea after a 3-2 aggregate triumph. There was more cup misery for Fulham on Saturday as they were dumped out of the FA Cup after a 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle. In terms of selection, Silva has no real injury concerns – barring the hamstring issue for winger Adama Traoré – though Alex Iwobi, Fodé Ballo-Touré and Calvin Bassey remain at the Africa Cup of Nations. Tim Ream is back to full fitness but playing a backup role to centre-back pairing Diop and Tosin Adarabioyo, while there could be a milestone on Tuesday for Andreas Pereira. Former Manchester United playmaker Pereira could make his 100th Premier League appearance. No Fulham player has been involved in more league goals than him this season (five), while he’s created more chances than any other player for the Cottagers. In what is the 30th different league campaign in which they’ve met, Fulham are looking to complete the league double over Everton for the very first time after Bobby De Cordova-Reid scored the winner in a 1-0 triumph at Goodison Park back in August. Dyche’s men will not just roll over at Craven Cottage, where Everton have lost only one of their last seven away league games against Fulham (W3 D3), having been beaten in nine of the 10 trips prior (W1). The Toffees have enjoyed their visits down south, winning three of their four Premier League games in London this season, though they did lose last time out against Tottenham. Only in 2020-21 under Carlo Ancelotti (five) have Everton won more often in the capital in a single Premier League campaign. Everton must watch out for Raúl Jiménez, however, as the Fulham striker has five Premier League goals against them – his most against an opponent in the competition – though all those strikes came in his first five appearances against the Toffees, failing to score in his last two against the blue half of Merseyside. Craven Cottage has become a tough place to visit, with Fulham winning four of their last five Premier League home games (L1), against Arsenal, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Wolves, as many as in their previous 12 at Craven Cottage (D2 L6). Indeed, each of the Cottagers’ last six Premier League wins have come on home soil – including wins over Sheffield United and Luton – with their last away league win coming at Everton in the opening game of this season. Everton may have fallen down the league table but only the current top two sides Liverpool (six) and Manchester City (seven) have won more Premier League away games this season than Everton (five). In stark contrast to previous struggles, five away wins this term for Everton is already one more than they managed in the previous two campaigns combined (four). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Tuesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: The Opta supercomputer expects Fulham to win on Tuesday, with the hosts victorious in 41.8% of 10,000 pre-match simulations, compared to an Everton triumph in just 28.8%. A draw appears to be slightly more likely than the visitors succeeding, with a stalemate occurring in 29.4% of data-led scenarios. Everton currently have a 15.1% chance of going down in Opta’s season simulations, with only Sheffield United (97.6%), Burnley (92.9%), Luton (52.6%) and Nottingham Forest (20.1%) seeing a greater likelihood.

We look ahead to the meeting with our Nottingham Forest vs Arsenal prediction and preview. Having suffered from a Christmas and New Year’s hangover, Arsenal will be looking for another response to make ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool and build upon a crushing victory over Crystal Palace when they visit Nottingham Forest for Tuesday’s clash at the City Ground. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta cut a frustrated figure over the festive period as his side were defeated in back-to-back league games with Fulham and West Ham United, plus their FA Cup third-round elimination against Jürgen Klopp’s Reds. However, the north London club responded with a 5-0 demolition of Palace on Matchday 21, leaving the Gunners level with Aston Villa and Manchester City – the latter who have a game in hand – as the trio trailing top-flight leaders Liverpool by five points heading into Matchday 22. Gabriel Magalhães scored the opener at the Emirates Stadium against the Eagles before adding a second soon after, while Leandro Trossard added another prior to Gabriel Martinelli’s late brace in a 21-minute substitute cameo, as many goals as he had managed in his previous 22 Premier League games combined. The opening two goals characterised Arsenal’s expertise from corners: they have scored the most goals from set-piece situations in the Premier League this season (13, excluding penalties), the most from corners (10) and the most headed goals (10). Meanwhile, Forest have conceded the most from set pieces (11), and only Brentford (11) have conceded more from headers (nine). Declan Rice and Gabriel were both removed as a precaution during the Palace win, though the pair are expected to return to Arteta’s lineup on Tuesday. That duo will solidify an impressive defensive setup that has kept the most Premier League clean sheets (eight). However, Arteta’s men are looking to record a shutout in consecutive league games for just the second time this term, previously doing so with wins against Bournemouth (4-0) and Man City (1-0) in September/October. As for the rest of Arteta’s team news, it stays the same: Japan’s Takehiro Tomiyasu and Egypt’s Mohamed Elneny are at the Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively, while Thomas Partey, Fábio Vieira and Jurriën Timber remain sidelined with long-term injuries. As for Tuesday’s hosts, Forest’s frustration with the Premier League continues to bubble on, with the City Ground club reportedly expecting a points deduction for financial breaches, while they wrote to the Professional Game Match Officials Board Limited (PGMOL) after Ivan Toney’s free-kick equaliser in a 3-2 loss to Brentford on MD 21. Toney removed the referee’s vanishing foam and shifted the ball sidewards – into what Forest claim was a more advantageous position – before scoring past Matt Turner, levelling after Danilo’s early opener. Ben Mee then put Thomas Frank’s hosts ahead in the second half before Neal Maupay crashed in the winner after Chris Wood had levelled in the 65th minute. Nuno Espírito Santo insisted the Video Assistant Referee should have checked Toney’s finish and intervened before Forest questioned the PGMOL for clarity after the defeat that leaves them 16th in the league table and just four points clear of 18th-placed Luton Town in the relegation zone ahead of MD 22. Forest have been the architects of their own downfall many a time, though, dropping 46 points from winning positions since the start of last season – at least 11 more than any other Premier League side. As for the hosts’ team news, Nuno remains short-handed by a plethora of absentees, with Sèrge Aurier, Willy Boly, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Ola Aina and Ibrahima Sangaré at the 2023 AFCON and loanee Nuno Tavares unable to feature against his parent club Arsenal. Tuesday’s kick-off will come too soon for Felipe and Taiwo Awoniyi, too, though Anthony Elanga and Divock Origi could return from injury, as Morgan Gibbs-White did in a goalless FA Cup fourth-round draw at Bristol City on Friday night. Nuno will likely again rely upon Wood up top, with the Forest striker involved in six goals in his last four Premier League appearances (five goals, one assist), as many as in his previous 45 combined. Wood is averaging a league goal every 72 minutes under Nuno, while converting 50% of his shots since the Portuguese took charge. Arsenal have won five of their last six Premier League games against Forest (L1). Arteta’s men are looking to do the double over them in the competition for just the second time (also 1998-99) after winning 2-1 in August thanks to goals from Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah, with Taiwo Awoniyi’s scoring a late consolation. However, Forest have won their last three home games against Arsenal in all competitions, winning FA Cup ties in 2018 (4-2) and 2022 (1-0) before a 1-0 victory in this exact fixture last season when Awoniyi scored to confirm Premier League safety for the hosts and hand the title to Manchester City. Forest have never won four consecutive home games against Arsenal but the troublesome away form of their visitors may open up an opportunity on Tuesday. Arsenal have struggled on the road, winning just two of their last seven Premier League away games – against Luton Town and Brentford – despite triumphing in their opening three such top-flight fixtures with Crystal Palace, Everton and Bournemouth this campaign.  The north London club are winless in their last three away league games after losing to Aston Villa and Fulham either side of a draw with Liverpool – they’ve not had a longer winless run under Arteta since his first six such games in charge between December 2019 and June 2020 (D4 L2). Forest are in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle with a reported points deduction looming, but their last two Premier League wins have been against sides that finished in last season’s top four – beating Newcastle United 3-1 and Manchester United 2-1 – despite winning just two of their previous 36 such games in the competition (D8 L26). Both victories over Newcastle and Man Utd came after Steve Cooper’s dismissal saw the appointment of Nuno, whose four Premier League games in charge of Forest have produced a total of 17 goals (F9 A8), an average of 4.3 per game – almost two goals per game more than his spells in the competition with Wolves (2.4) and Tottenham (2.5). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: The Opta supercomputer fancies an away win at the City Ground, with Arsenal winning 54.5% of 10,000 pre-game simulations, while Forest triumph in just 19.7%. A draw would signal more away-day frustration for Arsenal. That result is predicted in 25.8% of data-led scenarios, and would further damage the dwindling title hopes of Arteta’s side. Arsenal have just a 3.0% chance of winning the Premier League title in Opta’s season-simulations model – below favourites Man City (58.6%) and their nearest challengers Liverpool (37.2%) – while Forest’s relegation likelihood has jumped to 21.5% at the time of writing.

Look ahead to the game with our Morocco vs South Africa prediction and preview. Giant-killing was the name of the game in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations group stage, with Tunisia, Algeria and Ghana all going home early while a few others escaped near-misses; Morocco will be wary of the many shocks as they enter the knockouts with a last-16 duel with South Africa. Morocco may not have been spectacular in Group F, but their progression as section winners was pretty comfortable. No team in the tournament conceded fewer goals than their solitary concession against DR Congo, they trailed at no point in their three games, and their seven points was bettered by only Senegal (9). Coincidentally, Senegal (23.7%) are now – at the time of writing – the only side considered to have a better chance of going all the way than Morocco (17.2%), which is probably partly helped by the fact the earliest they can face each other is in the final. There’s still plenty of work to be done, however. Although Morocco’s progress through the group was largely comfortable on the face of it, they rode their luck against DR Congo on Matchday 2 and were hugely wasteful in the 1-0 win over Zambia. South Africa may not be strongest opposition they could face in the tournament, but Bafana Bafana did commendably hold Tunisia to a 0-0 draw and beat Namibia 4-0 in Group E. Prior to those two clean sheets, they had only recorded a pair of shutouts in their previous 11 AFCON games. Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams proved dependable in the group stage, preventing 1.8 goals (according to Opta’s xGOT metric), the third best of any keeper. They will likely require him to be at the top of his game again considering Morocco have scored in each of their last 12 AFCON games. The Atlas Lions were due to be without the influence of head coach Walid Regragui on the touchline once again; he was handed a four-match ban – two of which were suspended for a year – after his alleged role in ugly post-match scenes at the end of the draw with DR Congo, forcing him to watch the Zambia win from the stands. However, it was confirmed on Sunday that the ban and his fine have been overturned following a successful appeal, meaning Regragui will be back in the dugout on Tuesday. Whoever emerges victorious from this clash will face either Cape Verde or Mauritania in the quarter-finals. Morocco and South Africa are certainly not strangers to each other at this level; this will be their sixth meeting in the Africa Cup of Nations. Bafana Bafana have the historical edge, having only lost one of those five previous encounters, though Morocco were victorious in the most recent duel, winning 1-0 in the 2019 group stage. The only previous AFCON knockout match between Morocco and South Africa was in the 1998 quarter-final, a 2-1 victory for the latter in Burkina Faso. The Opta supercomputer expects Morocco to emerge from this tie; they won 56.1% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations in 90 minutes. South Africa came out on top in just 22.2% of the simulations, meaning 21.7% of them went to extra time and potentially penalties. When taking into account the possibility of the game being settled beyond 90 minutes, Morocco’s overall chance of progression is 67.8% according to the supercomputer. Below you’ll find the current, up-to-date chances of progression through to the next round in the ‘bracket’ tab, plus each team’s probability of winning the title in the ‘table’ tab: Morocco: Munir Mohamedi, Yassine Bounou, Mehdi Benabid, Nayef Aguerd, Achraf Hakimi, Romain Saïss, Chadi Riad, Yahya Attiat-Allah, Abdel Abqar, Yunis Abdelhamid, Noussair Mazraoui, Mohamed Chibi, Sofyan Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Amir Richardson, Selim Amallah, Oussama El Azzouzi, Amine Harit, Azzedine Ounahi, Bilal El Khannouss, Sofiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri, Abde Ezzalzouli, Ismael Saibari, Tarik Tissoudali, Amine Adli, Ayoub El Kaabi.

Group E Winners Mali will look to continue their solid AFCON 2023 with further progression in this tie with Burkina Faso on Tuesday. Topping the group ahead of South Africa, Namibia and Tunisia, Mali conceded just once in their three games, while goalkeeper Djigui Diarra showed solid form as he saved seven of the eight shots on target he faced (88%). Mali’s best finish was at the 1972 Nations Cup, when they finished second largely due to some stout defending. Focusing on defence over attack might be their best bet for success this time around, too. Auxerre forward Lassine Sinayoko scored in Mali’s opening two group games versus South Africa and Tunisia but was kept out by Namibia on Matchday 3 despite having a higher expected goals (xG) total than any other player on the pitch (0.48). He’ll be a big threat to a Burkina Faso defence that was breached four times in their last two games versus Algeria and Angola in Group D. The Stallions progressed to this stage of the competition after finishing as runners-up to Angola in the group stage, knocking out one of the pre-tournament favourites Algeria in the process. Two of their three group goals came via the experienced Bertrand Traoré, which takes his overall AFCON tournament tally to four goals – the only player with more in the competition for Burkina Faso is Alain Traoré, who scored five times between 2012 and 2017. This will be just the second match between Burkina Faso and Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations. The previous match occurred at the 2004 edition, when Mali defeated Burkina Faso 3-1 in the second group match in Tunis. Mali eventually went on to reach the semi-finals that year, before losing to Morocco 4-0. They finished in fourth place after a 2-1 play-off defeat to Nigeria. The Opta supercomputer saw Mali win this tie inside 90 minutes on 46.3% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations, compared to a 28.6% win rate by Burkina Faso. Before a ball was kicked at AFCON 2023, the Opta supercomputer rated Mali and Burkina Faso as outsiders for the tournament, but with nations like Algeria, Tunisia and Ghana now out, their chances have increased as we enter the knockout stages. Here are the current tournament projections for both Mali and Burkina Faso as things stand: Mali: Djigui Diarra, Aboubacar Doumbia, Ismaël Diawara, Mamadou Fofana I, Kiki Kouyaté, Sikou Niakaté, Hamari Traoré, Amadou Danté, Falaye Sacko, Moussa Diarra, Lassana Coulibaly, Adama Traoré, Yves Bissouma, Amadou Haidara, Aliou Dieng, Diadié Samassékou, Kamory Doumbia, Boubacar Traoré, Mohamed Camara, Moussa Doumbia, Sékou Koïta, Fousseni Diabaté, Ibrahim Sissoko, Lassine Sinayoko, Siriné Doucouré, Youssoufou Niakaté, Nene Dorgeles.

Will Ivan Toney build on his triumphant return to action? It was as if Ivan Toney had never been away. Having served his eight-month suspension for breaching the Football Association’s gambling rules, Toney scored with a clever – if slightly contentious – free-kick on his return to action against Nottingham Forest last time out, helping Brentford halt a five-match losing streak to ease relegation fears; they’ll hope to carry the momentum from that win into Wednesday’s London derby at Tottenham. Forest were less than pleased with the way Toney altered the position of the ball before whipping his free-kick into the bottom-right corner on Matchday 21, but that goal came at a crucial time for Brentford after they fell behind early on, and second-half strikes from Ben Mee and Neal Maupay ultimately handed them a 3-2 win. They enter Matchday 22 six points clear of the relegation zone and hoping for another result that’ll get them climbing up the table. However, having previously gone unbeaten in 14 consecutive Premier League London derbies, they have lost their last two such matches against Arsenal (1-0) and Crystal Palace (3-1). Toney will have a key role to play if Thomas Frank’s men are to spring a surprise at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he was not exactly prolific on the road prior to his suspension. Indeed, Toney’s last four Premier League goals have come at home, and he’s also alternated between scoring (eight times) and not scoring (eight) across his last 16 appearances in the competition. With Bryan Mbeumo still sidelined, Toney will hope to form a potent strike partnership with Maupay in the coming weeks. The Frenchman has scored in three successive matches across all competitions for the first time since doing so for Brighton and Hove Albion in December 2021. He last achieved that feat for Brentford in April 2019 in the Championship, during his first spell with the club. Brentford’s early FA Cup exit at the hands of Wolves means Frank has had additional time to prepare for Wednesday’s game, but he still has several selection issues to contend with. Aaron Hickey and Kevin Schade remain absent, while Christian Nørgaard is doubtful and loanee Sergio Reguilón is ineligible against his parent club. Tottenham, meanwhile, are looking to bounce back from Friday’s FA Cup fourth round defeat to Manchester City, with Nathan Aké’s late goal ensuring Spurs’ trophy drought will extend to at least 17 years barring a miraculous Premier League title success. Ange Postecoglou may now be highly unlikely to win silverware in his first campaign at the helm, but his side are in the mix for a top-four Premier League finish, having taken 13 points from their last six matches in the competition (four wins, one draw, one defeat). Tottenham twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at Manchester United in their last league outing, with Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur on target for Postecoglou’s men. With Son Heung-min still absent due to South Korea’s involvement at the AFC Asian Cup, Spurs will continue to look to Richarlison, who’s hit something of a purple patch. The Brazilian has six goals in his last six Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 47. He tends to enjoy playing at home, too, with eight of his 10 overall goal involvements this season coming in his last seven outings at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (five goals, three assists). The striker should be confident of receiving good service on Wednesday as well with James Maddison potentially in line for his first start since November after making his return from an ankle injury against City. He has averaged 3.14 chances created per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season – among all players to have played a minimum of 270 minutes, only Wolves’ Pablo Sarabia (3.5, 746 minutes played) averages more. Maddison’s return could allow Dejan Kulusevski to return to his usual right-wing role, from where the Swede has been a real livewire this season. He has created more chances following carries than any other player in the Premier League this term (19), although none of these have led to an assist. Pape Sarr and Yves Bissouma are not yet back from Africa Cup of Nations duty, while Giovani Lo Celso is sidelined with a thigh injury and both Alejo Véliz and Manor Solomon are long-term absentees. Tottenham have lost just one of their last nine league games against Brentford (three wins, five draws), though that defeat did come in this exact fixture last season, the Bees triumphing 3-1. The teams then played out a 2-2 draw on the opening day of this season at the Gtech Community Stadium, with Cristian Romero and Emerson Royal on target for Spurs in their first match under Postecoglou. Indeed, draws have been a theme of this fixture lately. Brentford lost their first Premier League meeting with Tottenham in December 2021 but have since gone four unbeaten against them, drawing three of those matches. Tottenham have lost their last two Premier League London derbies on home soil, going down 4-1 to Chelsea and 2-1 to West Ham. They last lost three successive home league meetings with fellow capital clubs in April 2004. Spurs have won their last three home league games, beating Newcastle United, Everton and Bournemouth, with that run coming after they lost three in a row at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November and December. They will certainly be confident of causing Brentford problems, having scored in each of their last 33 Premier League games. Only three teams have ever scored in more consecutive matches in the competition, with Arsenal having a 55-game run between 2001 and 2002, Manchester United enjoying a 36-game streak between 2007 and 2008, and Liverpool also netting in 36 straight between 2019 and 2020. Brentford’s win over Forest last time out ended a five-game losing run in the Premier League for Frank’s men, but they have lost their last four on the road in the competition. However, each of the Bees’ last four away league victories have come in London derbies, beating Fulham, Chelsea (twice) and Spurs going back as far as last April. The\\xa0Opta Power Rankings\\xa0are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides: Tottenham are clear favourites to pick up three points on Wednesday, winning 51.6% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations conducted by the Opta supercomputer. Brentford make it back-to-back wins in just 22.4% of scenarios, with the likelihood of a draw rated at 26%. In the supercomputer’s season predictions, fifth (39.8%) is still seen as Spurs’ most likely finishing position, with Aston Villa preferred for top four. Postecoglou’s men got a top-four finish in 35.5% of the latest simulations, however, so they’re very much in the race. Brentford, meanwhile, cut their chances of relegation to 2.9% with their win over Forest; 14th (19.9%) is their most common position across our projections. Enjoy this?

The tie of the last 16 at AFCON 2023 will take place on Monday as hosts Ivory Coast face reigning champions Senegal as they battle it out for a place in the quarter-finals. These two sides weren’t expected to meet this early in the tournament, with the Opta supercomputer rating them as the two favourites to win the title before a ball was kicked. Senegal were slight favourites to retain the crown at 12.8%, while Ivory Coast were just below on 12.1%. Senegal did as well as expected in the group stage, winning Group C with ease as they cruised past Gambia, Cameroon and Guinea, securing top spot with nine points – the only nation to win all three group matches. Nigeria were the only team to manage that in the last edition, but they exited the tournament in the following round following a shock defeat to Tunisia, a warning Senegal should heed. However, the last team to win their first four games of an AFCON tournament were Algeria in 2019, and they won the title. Ivory Coast’s campaign started well enough on paper with a 2-0 win over Guinea-Bissau, but it was a meek performance against what turned out to be the group’s weakest side. A 1-0 loss to Nigeria followed before a shambolic, record-breaking 4-0 defeat to unfancied Equatorial Guinea on Matchday 3 left them on the brink of elimination. They survived by the skin of their teeth as the lowest-ranked third-place finishers to qualify for the round of 16, but there was no surviving that defeat for coach Jean-Louis Gasset, who was promptly sacked. He’ll be replaced on the bench for this tie by assistant Emerse Faé, who will be hoping to work miracles to get his Ivorian side in shape to defeat arguably the best African team at this current time. They’ll have to stop a Senegal side that have shared their goals around so far, with seven players in the squad scoring at least once across the three group games. Despite these two nations having such rich history in the Africa Cup of Nations, this will be only the third time they have met at the tournament and the first time since 1986. That meeting 38 years ago saw Ivory Coast win 1-0 in the group stage, while they also defeated Senegal 1-0 in a third/fourth-place playoff match in the 1965 edition. One of these giants of African football will exit the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations before the quarter-final stage, as hosts Ivory Coast meet Senegal in the round of 16 on Monday. The Opta supercomputer is predicting a Senegal win, with the reigning AFCON champions winning the match inside 90 minutes in 53.5% of pre-game simulations. Below are the current, up-to-date tournament projections for both Senegal and Ivory Coast by the Opta supercomputer: Senegal: Mory Diaw, Seny Dieng, Édouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Youssouf Sabaly, Ismail Jakobs, Formose Mendy, Abdoulaye N’Diaye, Abdou Diallo, Fodé Ballo-Touré, Abdoulaye Seck, Moussa Niakhaté, Krépin Diatta, Idrissa Gueye, Pathé Ciss, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Nampalys Mendy, Lamine Camara, Pape Gueye, Pape Sarr, Sadio Mané, Habib Diallo, Nicolas Jackson, Boulaye Dia, Ismaïla Sarr, Iliman Ndiaye, Abdallah Sima.

Look ahead with our Cape Verde vs Mauritania prediction and preview. Neither Cape Verde nor Mauritania were expected to go deep into the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations before the tournament started, but their last-16 meeting on Monday means one of them will reach the quarter-finals. Although it wouldn’t be the first time Cape Verde have made it to the last eight, as they did so in their maiden AFCON 11 years ago, the Blue Sharks have undoubtedly defied expectations to get this far considering their performance in the group stage. Cape Verde topped a Group B that also contained record champions Egypt, Ghana and Mozambique. They didn’t lose once, rescuing a 2-2 draw in the ninth minute of stoppage time against the Pharaohs on Matchday 3 after beating the Black Stars 2-1 – also courtesy of a dramatic late goal – and the Mambas 3-0. Their two wins in this tournament is already the most they’ve managed in a single AFCON edition, and although they did make the last eight in 2013, that was before the tournament’s expansion; back then, the quarter-finals were the first round of the knockouts, so to reach them this time could arguably be seen as a greater achievement. Nevertheless, this game does represent history for Mauritania. Their Matchday 3 win over Algeria was their first ever victory at an AFCON, so they’ll be competing in their maiden knockout game against Cape Verde on Monday. Their route through the group stage was a little more fortunate than their next opponents’. Defeats to Angola and Burkina Faso in their first two games gave them the unenviable task of trying to get a result against a talented Algeria side; they managed it and those three points were just enough to take them through as one of the four best third-place teams. As such, they’re only the third team in AFCON history to reach the knockouts after losing their first two group matches. Against a Cape Verde side full of belief and riding the crest of a wave following three positive results, Mauritania’s luck might just run out, however. This will be the first ever meeting between Cape Verde and Mauritania at the Africa Cup of Nations, which is perhaps unsurprising considering both are relative newcomers to the tournament. They have played in other competitions, though. Their last encounter was in an African Nations Championship – a tournament in which teams can only pick players from their domestic leagues – qualifier in August 2019. Mauritania won that game 2-1 in Nouakchott. Cape Verde are considered firm favourites for this one by the Opta supercomputer as they won 56.3% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations in 90 minutes. Mauritania were only victorious in 22.1% of those. That means 21.6% of the time this game went to extra time and potentially penalties; taking those possibilities into account, the supercomputer gives Cape Verde a 62.8% likelihood of getting through to the quarter-finals (at the time of writing), as you’ll see below in the current, up-to-date projections through the rest of the tournament. Whoever goes through, it’ll be a considerable achievement. After all, in our pre-tournament predictions, Cape Verde (0.9%) and Mauritania (0.6%) were among the nine teams given less than a 1.0% chance of winning the whole thing; they’ve already outlasted some very reputable countries. Cape Verde: Márcio da Rosa, Vózinha, Dylan Silva, Stopira, Dylan Tavares, João Correia, Logan Costa, Steven Moreira, Pico, Diney Borges, Kenny Rocha, Laros Duarte, Deroy Duarte, Kevin Pina, Cuca, Patrick Andrade, Jamiro Monteiro, João Paulo, Ryan Mendes, Willy Semedo, Garry Rodrigues, Jovane Cabral, Bebé, Bryan Teixeira, Hélio Varela, Gilson Benchimol.

Look ahead to the first last-16 tie with our Angola vs Namibia prediction and preview. Angola and Namibia get the knockout stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations started on Saturday at Stade Bouaké, and it’s fair to say both have exceeded expectations in getting this far. At 117 and 115 respectively, Angola and Namibia were two of the lowest FIFA-ranked teams to reach the tournament, with only Gambia (126) and Tanzania (121) below them among the nations to qualify. They both then commendably came through tough groups. Angola topped Group D as they went unbeaten, drawing with Algeria – one of the pre-tournament favourites – on Matchday 1 before back-to-back wins over Mauritania and Burkina Faso, the latter of whom have reached the semi-finals at least in three of the past five AFCON tournaments. Namibia had to come through as one of the best third-place finishers, though their progression was no less of an achievement. Many considered them rank outsiders in a Group E that also contained Tunisia, Mali and South Africa. A dramatic 1-0 win over Tunisia on Matchday 1 was ultimately vital, with Deon Kavendji’s 88th-minute header putting them on the path to the knockouts. A heavy 4-0 defeat to Bafana Bafana followed and did put their position in doubt, particularly considering it damaged their goal difference, but they finished the opening section of the tournament by drawing 0-0 with Mali. That was enough for both to progress. The defeat of Tunisia was also Namibia’s first ever victory at the AFCON and means they’ve already broken new ground at this level, having never been beyond the group stage as an independent nation. Angola do have a little more pedigree as they reached the quarter-finals in 2008 and 2010, but victory on Saturday would see them equal that record and give them a chance of reaching a first semi-final. The stakes have rarely – if ever – been higher for these countries at the Africa Cup of Nations, but dreams of glory will be extinguished for one of them this weekend. Despite neither side having a particularly extensive AFCON history, Angola and Namibia have faced each other in the tournament before. During Namibia’s maiden appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations in 1998, they came up against Angola – themselves only appearing for a second time then – in the group stage. If Saturday’s meeting is anywhere near as entertaining as that encounter then we’ll have treated as they played out a 3-3 draw. Namibia were twice two goals to the good, but Angola fought back and eventually rescued a point through Miguel Pereira’s 86th-minute equaliser. Even if Namibia had held on to the win, they still wouldn’t have made it through to the knockouts as they were soundly beaten by South Africa in their final group game then, Benni McCarthy scoring all four goals in a 4-1 win for Bafana Bafana. The Opta supercomputer considers Angola favourites for this one as they won 43.8% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations in normal time.  We’ve seen many more one-sided predictions in this tournament, however, with Namibia’s 30.4% win rate in the simulations suggesting this could be a close contest; the game went to extra time 25.8% of the time. Either way, both sides will be thrilled to have even made it this far. In our pre-tournament predictions, these two were rated as having the joint-smallest chance of going all the way, doing do in 0.5% of the 10,000 simulations.  Both have seen boosts since then, and below you’ll find the up-to-date, current chances of progression through the knockouts.

Nigeria have reached the knockout stage of a 15th consecutive Africa Cup of Nations tournament following their advancement from Group A. They could only manage second place on goal difference behind unexpected group winners Equatorial Guinea, but ahead of hosts Ivory Coast in third. Indeed, only Egypt (44) have played more AFCON knockout matches than Nigeria (43), but it is Nigeria who have more knockout-stage wins than any other nation in the history of the tournament (23). Across all teams in the AFCON 2023 group stage, no nation conceded a lower expected goals (xG) total to opponents than Nigeria (1.28), while they were just one of four teams to concede only one goal in their three matches. However, it was a similar tale at the last AFCON for Nigeria, where they conceded only one goal in three group stage matches but went on to lose in the last 16 1-0 to Tunisia. Much of their attacking threat in the group stage came via Napoli frontman Victor Osimhen, who had 13 shots and created four more chances – the most shot involvements by a Nigerian player at AFCON 2023 and the most by a Nigerian in an AFCON group stage on record (since 2010). Cameroon head into the last 16 of AFCON 2023 thanks to a second-place finish in Group C behind reigning champions Senegal. They finished above third-place side Guinea on goals scored, but only qualified thanks to a dramatic 3-2 victory over Gambia on MD3. They found themselves 2-1 down in the 85th minute, before an own goal via James Gomez and an injury-time winner from Christopher Wooh sent them through. This was the only comeback win in the entire group stage of the tournament. Georges-Kévin Nkoudou impressed for them in the group stage, with a tournament-high 10 chances created for teammates. This is the most by a Cameroonian player at the group stage of an AFCON tournament since Benjamin Moukandjo in 2017 (12). They have reached the last 16 despite conceding more goals (6) than they scored (5) in the group stage – the first time that they have progressed from an AFCON group stage with a negative goal difference. Indeed, their six goals conceded were the most in a group stage at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament since 1996 (7). This will be the eighth meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations, with three of those previous games being finals (1984, 1988 and 2000). Overall, Cameroon have only lost more AFCON matches versus Egypt (4) than they have against the Nigerians (3). Since losing the 2000 AFCON final to Cameroon as host nation (4-3 on penalties following a 2-2 draw), Nigeria have won both of their meetings with the Indomitable Lions at AFCON. A 2-1 quarter-final victory in 2004 was followed by a 3-2 win over Cameroon at the 2019 tournament in the round of 16. Nigeria had fallen behind in that game, but Alex Iwobi scored a 66th-minute winner following an earlier brace from striker Odion Ighalo. Their last international meetings came in a June 2021 friendly double-header across 4 June and 8 June. Cameroon won the first match 1-0 thanks to a goal via André-Frank Zambo Anguissa before a 0-0 draw in the second game. The Opta supercomputer predicts that Nigeria will win this match inside 90 minutes and progress to the quarter-finals of AFCON 2023. They won 45.9% of the pre-match simulations run in normal time, compared to 28.9% by Cameroon. Before a ball was kicked in the tournament, Nigeria were given an 8% chance of winning the tournament with Cameroon just behind on 7.4%. Both sides have seen their chances improve following their group stage exploits, plus the exits of teams like Algeria, Tunisia and Ghana before the knockout stages. Here are the current tournament projections for both Nigeria and Cameroon by the Opta supercomputer as things stand: Nigeria: Olorunleke Ojo, Stanley Nwabali, Francis Uzoho, Kenneth Omeruo, William Troost-Ekong, Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Alhassan Yusuf, Raphael Onyedika, Joe Aribo, Frank Onyeka, Moses Simon, Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, Terem Moffi, Ademola Lookman, Paul Onuachu.

We look ahead to the game with our Equatorial Guinea vs Guinea prediction and preview. Equatorial Guinea have been the surprise package of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, having topped Group A ahead of AFCON heavyweights Nigeria and Ivory Coast, scoring nine goals in three games that included a 4-2 win over Guinea-Bissau and a 4-0 hammering of Ivory Coast, who are also the tournament’s hosts.  They were the AFCON 2023 group stage’s top scorers, more than playing their part in what is one of the highest-scoring and most entertaining AFCON tournaments ever. With their nine goals coming from just 3.97 xG, their overperformance compared to their xG of 5.03 was higher than any other team at the tournament. More of their shots from inside the box resulted in goals (seven) than did not (six). They stormed into the knockout rounds, confirming their progression out of the group at AFCON once again; they have now made it into the knockouts at all four AFCON tournaments they have played in. Guinea have more AFCON pedigree than their opponents here, but having scored just four goals in their last eight AFCON games and having lost each of their last six knockout games, the fact they have more experience at this stage of the tournament won’t count for much. Guinea also only made it out of their group in third place, although it should be said they finished behind Senegal and Cameroon in a tough group. They were only beaten to second place by Cameroon on goals scored, and they ended the group stage with the best record of the third-placed teams. They ended their group-stage campaign with a 2-0 defeat to Senegal, and were subjected to a third-place finish after Cameroon secured a dramatic late win over Gambia. AFCON 2023’s top scorer, Equatorial Guinea striker Emilio Nsue – formerly of Birmingham and Middlesbrough – will be the man to stop from Guinea’s point of view. At 34 years of age, he is already the oldest player to reach five goals at an AFCON tournament; with one more goal, he would become only the second player ever aged 30+ to make it to six goals. This will be the first meeting at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament between Equatorial Guinea and Guinea. Interestingly, though, this will be the third time at this tournament that Equatorial Guinea have faced an opponent for the first time at AFCON, drawing 1-1 with Nigeria and beating Guinea-Bissau 4-2. Equatorial Guinea are favourites to win this one having come through a tough group as surprise winners. The Opta supercomputer gives them a 42.5% chance of victory, compared to 31.5% for Guinea. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions gave Equatorial Guinea just a 0.8% chance of winning the whole tournament. That has increased more than five-fold after such an impressive group stage. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Equatorial Guinea: Aitor Embela, Manuel Sapunga, Jesús Owono, Saúl Coco, Basilio Ndong, Carlos Akapo, Esteban Orozco, Néstor Senra, Marvin Anieboh, Emilio Nsue, José Elo, Charles Ondo, Féderico Bikoro, José Machín, Santiago Eneme, Pablo Ganet, Álex Balboa, Jannick Buyla, Iban Salvador, José Miranda, Óscar Siafá, José Nabil, Salomón Obama, Noé Ela, Luís Asué.\\xa0 Coach: Juan Michá Guinea: Ibrahim Koné, Aly Keita, Moussa Camara, Mohamed Ali Camara, Sekou Sylla, Julian Jeanvier, Saïdou Sow, Mouctar Diakhaby, Antoine Conté, Issiaga Sylla, Ibrahim Diakité, Seydouba Cissé, Amadou Diawara, Naby Keïta, Mory Konaté, Ilaix Moriba, Abdoulaye Touré, Aguibou Camara, Mohamed Bayo, José Kanté, Serhou Guirassy, Morgan Guilavogui, Facinet Conté, Karim Cissé, François Kamano.\\xa0 Coach: Kaba Diawara Enjoy this?

The AFCON 2023 draw specialists will meet on Sunday, as Egypt and DR Congo battle for a spot in the quarter-finals. Both nations drew all three of their games in the group stage, becoming just the fifth and sixth teams since 1996 to qualify for the knockout stages with three draws. While this game can be drawn and eventually head to penalties, only one can progress to the next round. A penalty shootout might be required, as Egypt are involved. Four of their last seven AFCON knockout ties have gone to a penalty shootout, including three of their four at the last tournament in January/February 2022. Every one of Egypt’s knockout stage matches at that tournament went to extra time before they eventually lost on penalties to Senegal in the final (4-2). Overall at AFCON 2021, Egypt had to play 801 minutes and 49 seconds of football – 97 minutes more than the eventual tournament winners, Senegal. Mohamed Salah was a key part of their run to the final that year, but he’ll be missing from this game following an injury suffered in the group stage against Ghana. He scored a 97th-minute penalty in their tournament opener versus Mozambique to secure a 2-2 draw. In fact, in all three of their group games (also 2-2 vs Ghana and 2-2 vs Cape Verde) Egypt were forced to come from a goal down to secure a point. Striker Mostafa Mohamed will be looking to keep up his record of netting in every match in this tournament – no Egyptian player has ever scored in their first four appearances at a single edition of an Africa Cup of Nations. While DR Congo also drew their three group games, they were lower-scoring affairs (four goals overall) than Egypt’s three matches (12 goals in total). They came from behind to draw 1-1 with both Zambia and Morocco before their final game against Tanzania ended 0-0 and saw them secure second place in Group F behind the Moroccans. Of the 16 teams remaining at AFCON 2023, only Namibia (1) scored fewer goals in the group stage than DR Congo (2), while they scored their two goals from an expected goals (xG) total of 5.0 – only Nigeria (-3.1) had a bigger underperformance in relation to their xG total in the group stage than DR Congo (-3.0). This will be the fifth Africa Cup of Nations encounter between Egypt and DR Congo, with the Pharoahs winning three of the previous four (L1). Egypt and DR Congo have met twice previously in the knockout rounds of the Africa Cup of Nations, each winning once (DR Congo won 3-2 in the semi-final in 1974 and Egypt won 4-1 in the quarter-final in 2006). On both occasions the winner of the tie went on to lift the trophy that year – DR Congo (as Zaire) in 1974 and Egypt in 2006. Their meeting in the AFCON 2019 group stage – a 2-0 win for the Egyptians, with Mohamed Salah scoring the second goal – was the last international played between the two nations. The Opta supercomputer predicts that Egypt will win this match inside 90 minutes and progress to the quarter-finals of AFCON 2023. They won 47.0% of the pre-match simulations run, compared to 28.1% by DR Congo. Before a ball was kicked in the tournament, Egypt were made the fifth-most likely team to win AFCON 2023 by the Opta supercomputer (8.5%) behind only Senegal (12.8%), Ivory Coast (12.1%), Morocco (11.1%) and Algeria (9.7%), who are already out of the tournament. DR Congo were given a 2.4% chance, but that’s increased following the exit of more favoured teams like the Algerians, Ghana and Tunisia. Here are the current tournament projections for both Egypt and DR Congo by the Opta supercomputer as things stand: Egypt: Mohamed Abou Gabal, Mohamed Sobhi, Mohamed El Shenawy, Ahmed El Shenawy, Ahmed Samy, Ali Gabr, Mohamed Hany, Mohamed Hamdy, Yasser Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdelmonem, Omar Kamal, Ahmed Abou El Fotouh, Ahmed Hegazy, Trézéguet, Mohamed Elneny, Marwan Attia, Mahmoud Hamada, Hamdi Fathy, Emam Ashour, Mohanad Lasheen, Zizo, Mohamed Salah, Koka, Mostafa Fathi, Kahraba, Mostafa Mohamed, Omar Marmoush.

This would’ve been the first question swirling around many people’s heads, but considering Klopp is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League at the moment, it feels bizarre to be thinking about someone else in charge of Liverpool. Klopp has become synonymous with the Reds, but filling his shoes is now the task in front of the Liverpool hierarchy, and already there’s an early favourite. Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso reportedly has a get-out clause in his Bayer Leverkusen contract that would allow him to depart for a small number of specific clubs, one of which is the Reds. Of course, it’s not just that apparent availability that’ll make him an attractive prospect; he is, after all, doing a sterling job in the Bundesliga with Leverkusen. After taking over from Gerardo Seoane in October 2022 with the team second-bottom after eight matches, Alonso oversaw a huge turnaround in their fortunes. They went on to finish sixth, with Leverkusen’s 45 points won after Alonso’s arrival bettered only by Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund (both 56) and RB Leipzig (55). And despite losing Moussa Diaby to Aston Villa in the summer, they bolstered the squad well with the shrewd acquisitions of Alex Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka and Victor Boniface, among others. Eighteen games into the 2023-24 season and Leverkusen are four points clear of Bayern and rated as the favourites to lift the title, according to the Opta supercomputer. Leverkusen were fairly pragmatic last season on the whole, but this term their style has changed quite dramatically. Alonso has turned them into an attack-minded and possession-dominant side that presses high. In 2023-24, they’ve recorded more high turnovers (191) and open-play sequences of at least 10 passes (405) than any other Bundesliga side, becoming a team that takes the game to the opposition. Not only are Leverkusen’s improved fortunes in the table a good summary of Alonso’s job, but the changes he’s overseen in terms playing style highlight his qualities as a coach. Steven Gerrard is another obvious name that is being bandied around, but compared to his former midfield partner, his coaching credentials probably aren’t up to scratch.\\xa0 The 2021-22 season saw Klopp bring yet more silverware to Liverpool’s now rapidly-filling trophy cabinet. His side secured a domestic cup double, beating Chelsea on penalties in both the FA Cup and League Cup. But the true legacy of that season will always be just how close Klopp and Liverpool came to achieving an unprecedented quadruple. Once again, they pushed Manchester City to the final day of the season and came within 15 minutes of winning the title, only for City to score three goals in the dying embers of their home match against Aston Villa to snatch the title back. That was followed by a 1-0 Champions League final defeat six days later to Real Madrid, in which Liverpool were by far the better team. Madrid had just three shots to Liverpool’s 23, as Thibaut Courtois won the Man of the Match award. The hangover of narrowly missing out on the quadruple seemed to impact Liverpool in the following season, which saw them come crashing down to earth. The Community Shield was the only silverware they came away with and it was an inconsistent campaign, peppered with seemingly random results including a 9-0 thrashing of Bournemouth and 7-0 hammering of Manchester United, but with chaotic away defeats littered throughout. The end result was a fifth-place finish, Liverpool’s lowest league finish since Klopp’s first season in charge (8th in 2015-16). It was also a season that saw Sadio Mané – after 196 appearances and 90 league goals – depart for Bayern Munich. Replacement forwards Darwin Nuñez and Cody Gakpo arrived, but with a tired and aging squad, those moves were a precursor for the huge turnover that came in the summer of 2023. Ahead of the 2023-24 season, Liverpool’s rebuild went into overdrive. Out went Roberto Firmino (256 league appearances for the club), Jordan Henderson (360), James Milner (230), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (103), Fabinho (151) and Naby Keïta (84). These had been huge players for the club, present for the successes of recent years, winning the Champions League, Premier League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, League Cup and FA Cup. Five of those players were midfielders and it was clearly an area that needed extensive work. Many laid the blame for Liverpool’s poor 2022-23 campaign at the feet of the midfield cohort, who so often looked to be outrun and outfought. To replace them, in came Dominik Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig, Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, Ryan Gravenberch from Bayern Munich and Wataru Endo from Stuttgart. But despite so many new faces, Liverpool’s midfield has fired pretty much from the off, while their existing senior players, like Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson and Virgil van Dijk, have all been excellent. Time will tell whether Klopp can enjoy a swansong. The Reds are top of the Premier League, through to the final of the League Cup and into the knockout stage of the UEFA Europa League. More trophies could be coming their way before love affair comes to an end. Champions League glory in 2019 more than made up for the gutting nature of their runners-up placing in the Premier League, though there was undoubtedly a huge appetite for Liverpool to finally end their barren run in the English top flight. Accumulating a whopping 97 points in 2018-19 proved they were good enough and they managed to keep the bulk of the squad together. At the very least they looked primed for another challenge in 2019-20. You could argue they were actually the only challengers for much of the season. Liverpool were head and shoulders above the rest, eventually earning 99 points, 18 more than any other team. They were so dominant that at one stage they were 25 points clear, the biggest gap from first to second in Premier League history, and went on to equal the records for the most wins (32), home wins (18) and consecutive wins (18). The one downer to their success, a first Premier League title, was the lack of fans. With the coronavirus pandemic striking in early 2020, Liverpool lifted the trophy in an empty Anfield as the final months of the season had to be played behind closed doors. Nevertheless, their success ended 30 years of top-flight failure and provided Klopp with the trophy his impact and management deserved. When Jürgen Klopp was appointed as Brendan Rodgers’ successor, Liverpool had long been considered huge underachievers in the Premier League. They’d finished higher than third just three times and not won the league title at all since the old Division One days (1990). He took over in October 2015 with Liverpool 10th in the Premier League. His own target was to get them winning trophies again within four years, and to be fair to him, the club’s transformation was pretty swift. Not immediate, though. Liverpool finished eighth in the Premier League in Klopp’s first season at the helm, highlighting how much work needed to be done. Nevertheless, reaching the finals of the League Cup and UEFA Europa League in 2016 – losing out to Manchester City and Sevilla, respectively – were hints of the positivity to come. Successive fourth-place finished followed in the Premier League, and in 2018 they reached the final of the UEFA Champions League. While that made it three final defeats for Klopp at Liverpool, demonstrable progress was being made, with the manager and his recruitment team building a fine team. That European run seemed to change everything, like it convinced them they were on the right path. In 2018-19, Liverpool went one better as they defeated Tottenham in the Champions League final, and had it not been for arguably the best team in Premier League history, Liverpool would’ve won the league title as well. As it happened, they finished second to Manchester City despite their 97 points being the third-highest total in the competition’s history and the most ever recorded by a team who didn’t win the title. Either way, Klopp succeeded in his plan to bring glory back to Anfield within four years. Liverpool were back. Should he keep up the good form in his remaining months in charge of the club, there’s no doubt that Jürgen Klopp will leave as the most successful Liverpool manager of all time in terms of win ratio.  His current win rate stands at 60.7%, above that of Kenny Dalglish (58.3%) and Bob Paisley (57.4%), although he’s won considerably less league titles at the club (one) than both Dalglish (three) and Paisley (six). Klopp is the only Liverpool manager to win each of the top-flight, European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup, and League Cup with the club, however. Liverpool fans will take some consoling at the moment; finding the words to paint a positive picture is a difficult task considering what Klopp has achieved at the club, but his comments about leaving the team in a good place certainly ring true. After all, his announcement came with Liverpool five points clear at the top of the Premier League. Sure, second-placed Manchester City also have a game in hand, but to this point, the Reds have been the most consistent team in the top flight in 2023-24. With just one defeat – at Tottenham in September – and having already taken points from trips to Manchester City and Arsenal, Liverpool find themselves in an enviable position, and this is testament to not only Klopp’s management, but his squad planning. As Klopp alluded to in his interview, the Reds found themselves falling behind the rest last season. They finished the 2022-23 campaign fifth in the Premier League, with the squad requiring plenty of rejuvenation. He led that with the acquisitions of Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo, and for the most part, their collective impact has been considerable, helping transform Liverpool back into one of the Premier League’s best, if not the\\xa0best. There’s still work to be done, but the Opta supercomputer rates Liverpool’s title chances at 37.3%; while that may not sound so impressive for a team five points clear, City had for so long been utterly dominant in our model’s season projections. Now, the Reds are worthy challengers. Of course, the significance of Klopp going out with another Premier League success shouldn’t be glossed over; it would once again take Liverpool level with Manchester United (20) for the most top-flight titles in English football history. It would be a fitting narrative when you consider what Klopp has meant to Liverpool, with his arrival undoubtedly key in establishing the Reds among the absolute elite once again. 5 – The five longest winning runs by managers in Premier League history:18 – Jürgen Klopp (Oct 2019-Feb 2020)18 – Pep Guardiola (Aug-Dec 2017)17 – Jürgen Klopp (Mar-Oct 2019)15 – Pep Guardiola (Feb-Aug 2019)15 – Pep Guardiola (Dec 2020-Mar 2021)Era. pic.twitter.com/ApytHzI3XS Liverpool still have 17 Premier League games remaining this season, meaning that Jürgen Klopp will end his spell at the club on 334 league matches.  In his 317 so far, he’s averaged an exceptional 2.12 points per game, which is below only Pep Guardiola (2.34) and Sir Alex Ferguson (2.16) of those to have taken charge of at least 50 games in the competition. Liverpool’s next win in the Premier League will be Klopp’s 200th in the competition, meaning he’d become just the seventh boss to reach the landmark after Ferguson (528), Arsène Wenger (476), David Moyes (265), Harry Redknapp (236), José Mourinho (217) and Guardiola (210). Only three of those (Ferguson at Man Utd, Wenger at Arsenal and Guardiola at Man City) have won 200 Premier League games at a single club, however. Those 199 Premier League wins are the second most by a club since Klopp’s first league game in charge of the Reds on 17 October 2015 versus Tottenham, with only Manchester City winning more points (716) and games (223) in that timeframe. Klopp still has at least four months to go in his tenure at Liverpool, with the club still in with a chance of sealing a domestic treble plus the UEFA Europa League title. He took his side to the EFL Cup final in midweek following a victory over Fulham, and will face Chelsea at Wembley next month. He will, however, fall short of reaching 500 games in charge of the club – something that only Bob Paisley, Tom Watson and Bill Shankly have done. 10.36am GMT will be remembered by Liverpool fans for a long time. It was at this time that Jürgen Klopp sensationally announced he was to leave his job as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2023-24 season. The news was broken on all social media channels by Liverpool FC themselves: A message to Liverpool supporters from Jürgen Klopp. pic.twitter.com/l7rtmxgOzt The 56-year-old has been in charge at Anfield since October 2015 and enjoyed considerable success with the club, but he suggested the draining nature of the job is taking its toll. Liverpool confirmed Klopp’s decision in a post on social media before publishing a short interview in which the German outlined his reasons for stepping aside. He told the club’s official media channels: “I will leave the club at the end of the season. I can understand that that’s a shock for a lot of people in this moment, when you hear it for the first time, but obviously I can explain it – or at least try to explain it. “I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about the city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. I love everything. But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take. “It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy. I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again. “After the years we had together and after all the time we spent together and after all the things we went through together, the respect grew for you, the love grew for you and the least I owe you is the truth – and that is the truth. That’s it, pretty much.” Klopp went on to confirm this was not a snap decision; instead, it was one he made a few months ago, content in the knowledge that he will be leaving with the team in good shape once again. “I am OK,” he added. “I am healthy, as much as you can [be] at my age. Little bits and bobs, stuff like that, but nothing anybody has to be concerned about, so that’s absolutely fine. I told the club already in November. “I have to explain a little bit that maybe the job I do people see from the outside, I’m on the touchline and in training sessions and stuff like this, but the majority of all the things happen around these kind of things. That means a season starts and you plan pretty much the next season already. When we sat there together talking about potential signings, the next summer camp and can we go wherever, the thought came up, ‘I am not sure I am here then anymore’ and I was surprised myself by that. “I obviously start thinking about it. It didn’t start [then], but of course last season was kind of a super-difficult season and there were moments when at other clubs probably the decision would have been, ‘Come on, thank you very much for everything but probably we should split here, or end it here.’ “That didn’t happen here, obviously. For me it was super, super, super-important that I can help to bring this team back onto the rails. It was all I was thinking about. When I realised pretty early that happened, it’s a really good team with massive potential and a super age group, super characters and all that, then I could start thinking about myself again and that was the outcome. It is not what I want to [do], it is just what I think is 100 per cent right. That’s it.” Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to the game with our data-powered Chelsea vs Aston Villa prediction and preview. Just three days after securing a place at Wembley in the EFL Cup, Chelsea will continue to their bid to make it to the national stadium in another competition when they host Aston Villa in the FA Cup. The all-Premier League fourth round tie on Friday looks like one of the most attractive fixtures in the last 32, as two teams who have been important parts of the tournament’s history face off. Chelsea are eight-time FA Cup winners, although their last success was in 2018 after they were beaten by Liverpool in a heart-breaking final in 2022, a year when they also made it to the Carabao Cup showpiece against the Reds, who they will face one again in a cup final next month. Recent success in the competition has been tougher to come by for Aston Villa. It is 67 years since they last lifted the trophy in 1957, with the most recent final appearance being a 4-0 defeat to Arsenal in 2015. But Villa are seven-time winners and that history has been regularly referenced by manager Unai Emery as something he wants to revive. That process started with their 1-0 third-round win at Middlesbrough, which ended a dreadful run of eight consecutive FA Cup defeats. Chelsea come into the clash on a huge high, having thrashed Boro 6-1 on Tuesday to secure a 6-2 aggregate triumph in their EFL Cup semi-final, emphatically responding to their worrying 1-0 away loss in the first leg. Two goals from in-form Cole Palmer, bouncing back from a nightmare in front of goal at the Riverside, were supplemented by strikes from Enzo Fernandez, Axel Disasi and Noni Madueke, after the Blues were put on the path to victory by a Jonny Howson own goal. That semi-final progress has been coupled with some improved Chelsea form. They have won seven of their last nine matches (including the EFL Cup win over Newcastle on penalties) and moved back within striking distance of the top six in the Premier League table. That still puts them well short of Villa, who are fourth and 12 points better off despite a minor recent stumble that has seen them win just one of their last four top-flight matches. Villa are stronger at home than on their travels, but can take comfort from the fact they have won their last two trips to Stamford Bridge. They have the chance to win three straight games against Chelsea for the first time since 1984, while it was 1960 when they last won three consecutive away matches in this fixture. But the Blues have a magnificent home record in FA Cup matches, with 40 wins, five draws and two defeats in their last 47 such games, so Villa face a tough test if they are to record another away triumph. Chelsea could be without 11 first-team players, including injured captain Reece James and striker Nicolas Jackson, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations, an absence which is giving Armando Broja a chance to stake his claim for a long-term future at the club. There was at least a boost when Ben Chilwell made first club start for 118 days against Boro. Pau Torres, Jacob Ramsey and Lucas Digne are all injury doubts for Villa, but Emery does not have anywhere near the injury issues of opposite number Mauricio Pochettino. Aston Villa have already won at Stamford Bridge this season, triumphing 1-0 in September, and they also recorded a 2-0 victory at Chelsea in April towards the end of the 2022-23 campaign. A red card to Malo Gusto proved costly for Chelsea in the 2023-24 meeting, with Ollie Watkins firing in a late winner past Robert Sanchez as Villa punished the 10-man hosts, who were enduring a difficult start to the Pochettino era. Jackson and Raheem Sterling were both thwarted by Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez as Villa claimed a valuable away win. The victory last season had continued to pile pressure on then-manager Graham Potter, with the two clubs trending in opposite directions at that point as Emery’s methods made an immediate impact at Villa Park. Watkins was again among the scorers, netting after a mistake from Marc Cucurella, and the win was sealed by a powerful strike from John McGinn. Pochettino will feel in a better place now than he did in the early stages of his reign and Chelsea had won the previous four meetings with Villa before the two most recent defeats, including winning a League Cup third-round tie on penalties in 2021-22. The Blues have had Villa’s number in the FA Cup too. They have won the last three meetings between the sides in this competition, including a final triumph in 2000 when Roberto Di Matteo scored the winner. There was also a 2010 semi-final win where late goals from Didier Drogba, Florent Malouda and Frank Lampard sent the Blues into another final, which they won against Portsmouth. Chelsea’s improvement has been in large part down to Palmer, who has raced on to 11 goals and seven assists from just 23 appearances in all competitions since signing from Manchester City and saw his performances rewarded with an England call-up. Three straight Premier League wins over Crystal Palace, Luton Town and Fulham had improved the mood even before the rallying win over Boro in midweek. And the Blues have an impressive recent FA Cup track record. Since losing to Manchester United in 2019, they have won eight home ties in a row by an aggregate score of 24-3. Sterling is a player who enjoys this competition. He netted in the 4-0 third-round win over Preston North End and has 19 goal involvements (10 goals and nine assists) in his last 20 FA Cup starts. The last time he faced Villa in this competition, Sterling helped former club Man City to a 4-0 cup win in 2016, scoring in that fixture. The Villans drew 0-0 at Everton last time out, their second consecutive clean sheet, with the main recent blot on their copybook being the Boxing Day collapse at Old Trafford, where they squandered a two-goal half-time lead and were beaten 3-2. They have also relied on late goals to salvage results against Brentford, Sheffield United and Burnley, so do not come into the match at the peak of their powers. But it has still been a stunning season with the prospect of UEFA Champions League qualification – and maybe even a shock title push – still on the table heading into the final months of the campaign. While the win over Boro ended a long FA Cup slump, Villa have still lost their last seven away FA Cup matches against EPL teams. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Friday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. With home advantage, some impressive recent form and a strong track record in the FA Cup, Chelsea are given the advantage over Aston Villa by the Opta supercomputer. The Blues are favourites with a win probability of 45.8%, but our predictive model is not expecting a one-sided encounter and still gives Villa a decent chance of progressing themselves (29.1%) or forcing a replay if the contest is drawn (25.1%). Villa have a substantial 69.4% probability of achieving a Premier League top-four finish, according to our season simulations, so this competition might hold more importance for Chelsea (who have just a 0.4% chance). However, Villa have not played since January 14 and have a cleaner bill of health, so it is easy to see why the system has kept its options open for one of the closest ties to call this week.

Here, we look ahead to it with our Tottenham vs Manchester City prediction and preview The pick of the FA Cup fourth round ties pits reigning champions and favourites, Manchester City, against arguably their biggest bogey team, Tottenham. Under the lights on Friday night, this is a huge occasion. City have always taken the FA Cup seriously, but it isn’t a competition they have won all that often by their standards. Two FA Cup successes in the last 12 seasons doesn’t reflect their recent dominance of English football; by way of comparison, they have won the Premier League seven times in that period. They did win the FA Cup last year, however, as part of their historic treble win. It was the second time Pep Guardiola had won the trophy. Guardiola may be disappointed to have been drawn against Tottenham here, though, having lost all five of their trips to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in all competitions (four in the Premier League, one in the Champions League) without scoring a single goal. They have had 84 shots and 22 shots on target in those games without any finding the net. Guardiola has joked before that scoring away to Spurs is his next biggest challenge after completing last season’s treble. While Man City are battling on three fronts and hoping to win the treble again this year, the FA Cup represents by far Spurs’ best chance of silverware. Fifth in the Premier League and eight points behind leaders Liverpool, the FA Cup is arguably their only opportunity of ending a trophy drought that stretches back to 2008. Manager Ange Postecoglou knows how much the fans want a trophy and will be taking the competition seriously, but he will be hoping for a better and more fluent performance than his team put in as they saw off Burnley in the previous round. That night, Spurs created very little and relied on Pedro Porro’s long-range strike to make the difference. Tottenham have won 12 of their last 13 home FA Cup games since a 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at White Hart Lane in February 2016, but they won’t have faced as big a test as this in a long time. In fact, this is the first time they have faced the holders of the FA Cup on home soil since 1952, when they lost 3-0 to Newcastle. What’s more, City have won their last 21 FA Cup matches played anywhere other than Wembley, making it at least as far as the semi-finals in each of the last five seasons. They thrashed Championship side Huddersfield 5-0 at home in the last round. In terms of team news, Tottenham could be in for a big boost, with James Maddison having last week made his return to first-team training after an ankle injury that has ruled him out of action since that 4-1 defeat to Chelsea in early November. He may not be ready to start here, but there is a good chance he’ll be involved. Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma and Son Heung-min are still away on international duty at the AFCON and Asian Cup respectively, while Giovani Lo Celso, Ben Davies and Alejo Velíz remain out injured. Look who's back 👀 pic.twitter.com/NzFX7INPp1 City look likely to remain without key men Erling Haaland, John Stones and Manuel Akanji. Goalkeeper Ederson was forced off in the win over Newcastle last time out but it looked like a knock to the head which, after a 13-day break, he should have recovered from. Kevin De Bruyne, meanwhile, could be ready to make his first start since the opening day of the Premier League season. This will be the 15th game between Tottenham and Manchester City in the FA Cup and first since a fourth round replay in 2003-04. That game produced a famous result, as City came from 3-0 down at half-time with 10 men to win 4-3, with Jon Macken scoring a 90th-minute winner. Since then, there have been plenty of high-profile meetings, such as in the battle for Champions League qualification in 2010, as well as the Champions League quarter-final tie in 2019. City have won more trophies than Spurs could dream of in the intervening period, but Spurs have shocked their opponents plenty of times when these sides have met. The most recent meeting is an example of just that, when a depleted and out-of-form Tottenham headed to the Etihad last month for a Premier League clash. Without 11 players due to injury or suspension and on a run of three consecutive defeats, Spurs went into an early lead and then twice came from behind to secure an invaluable and morale-boosting 3-3 draw. City have not scored a single goal in their five trips to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, failing with all 84 of their attempts, including a missed penalty in the Champions League quarter-final defeat in 2019. City come into the game on the better form, having won six in a row in all competitions despite being without Erling Haaland. That run does, however, include two games at the FIFA Club World Cup and a 3-2 win at Newcastle last time out that required a Kevin De Bruyne-inspired late turnaround and a 90th-minute winner from Oscar Bobb. Spurs have won five of their last seven games, but in that time they also fell to a 4-2 defeat at Brighton with one of their worst performances since Postecoglou came in. They have, however, won four in a row on home soil since a 2-1 defeat to West Ham. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Friday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite their poor record at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Man City are still deemed favourites to win this match according to the Opta supercomputer. They are given a 55.8% chance of victory. Spurs have just 21.4% chance of winning, while the tie was sent to a replay in 22.8% of scenarios.  Who do you think is going to win the FA Cup?

A move to West Ham appears ideal for him, and it will suit David Moyes and Gareth Southgate, too. Just 18 months into the six-year contract Kalvin Phillips signed at Manchester City in July 2022, he is off again, having failed to convince Pep Guardiola – seemingly at any stage of his City career – that he was worthy of any kind of role, prominent or not, with the champions. So, with only one more competitive start (six) than he won trophies (five) with City, he is finally off, heading to West Ham on loan for the rest of the season. It’s been obvious for the entire time he’s been at City that Guardiola doesn’t trust him. Quite why, exactly, has been less clear, even after the City manager’s recent attempt at an explanation. “It’s just because I visualise some things and visualise the team and things – and I struggle to see him,” Guardiola said last month when asked why Phillips is so rarely used. He did, at least, admit that his reasons for Phillips’ continued omission were purely footballing, saying: “The only thing I can say about him is I am asking for good personalities and characters and he is a perfect example. He trains really good and he’s a lovely guy and character.” Phillips, 28, was in danger of letting his career peter out. His stock had been so high in 2022 that the champions were willing to spend £42 million on him, but having played so little football for City, it might not be all that surprising if this was a case – one we’ve seen many times before in the Premier League – of a player’s talent going to waste. The further he got into that six-year contract, the more likely that scenario became. But Phillips has always been the model professional, and in a team that suits him a little more than City’s apparently did, he has the attitude and ability to play at the top for a good few years yet. West Ham looks like just the place to rediscover the form that earned Phillips his move to City in the first place. In some senses, David Moyes isn’t quite the perfect manager for Phillips, a ball-playing defensive midfielder who would rather be on the ball than chasing it. It is more than a little reductive to say Moyes doesn’t want his team to have the ball, but he certainly prioritises defensive shape and resilience over ball retention. West Ham have the fourth-lowest average possession share in the Premier League this season, seeing just 40% of the ball. There is more to that statistic than meets the eye, though. West Ham do indeed tend to let their opponents have the ball, but their possession numbers are skewed by a few extreme games. They alone account for four of the 19 occasions on which a team has had 26% possession or less in a Premier League match this season.  But they have also dominated possession in some games this season, too. Against Everton in October, they had 63.7% of the ball, just a few weeks after they had 22.0% of the ball against Brighton. They also, however, tend to get their best results when they have very little of the ball. Improving when they dominate is a priority, and signing Phillips is an attempt to do just that. Moyes’ side have won the four games this season in which they have had their lowest average possession: 3-1 at Brighton, 3-1 at home to Chelsea (24.4% possession), 2-1 at Tottenham (25%), and 2-0 at Arsenal (25.9%). The Brighton game also brought their highest xG total in a league game this season. They lost the aforementioned game against Everton, with their lowest xG for the season. And although they won 2-1 at Luton with 61.3% possession – their second-highest share of possession in a game this season – they dropped points at home to Crystal Palace with their third-highest possession share, drawing 1-1. This has been an issue for West Ham for a while. Their struggles in games when their opponents allowed them to dominate the ball were part of the reason that fans grew impatient with Moyes at the end of his first spell as manager, as well as at times in this current spell. The Manuel Pellegrini experiment and Moyes’ recent success have proved that the grass isn’t always greener. West Ham are having a very, very good season right now. They are sixth in the table and still in with a chance of breaking into the Champions League places, particularly if the Premier League is awarded a fifth spot in Europe’s premier competition next season. Dropped points at home to teams like Everton and Crystal Palace are arguably what’s separating West Ham from the top five.  So, if West Ham are to move up the table – they might not get a better chance to qualify for the Champions League than this – turning results like a defeat to Everton and a draw against Crystal Palace into wins might just be the easiest route to bridging that gap. Phillips’ passing ability will certainly improve his side when they have the ball, so he could be key to making them a better side against teams who sit back. He is at his best in front of his team’s defence, circulating possession, and moving the ball quickly and efficiently to more attack-minded players.  He has an exceptional passing range, and although he is considered in possession, he also isn’t scared of mixing it up and taking risks. In the 2020-21 Premier League season – Leeds’ first back in the top flight and the campaign in which Phillips played his most prominent role at the top level – he ranked way down the league for successful passes per 90 (44.1), but he was also sixth out of 176 players to play at least 2,000 minutes for successful switches of play per 90. With 5.0 accurate long balls per 90, he ranked seventh among outfielders in that group. That long-ball ability will be most useful in trying to isolate tricky players such as Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus against defenders – something that West Ham need to do more effectively in games when they have lots of the ball – but would also be of great use to help West Ham break up the pitch at speed. Phillips has the ability to play long balls in behind the opposition from deep inside his own half. He is also an elite ball-winner, and brings extra protection to the defence, with a game intelligence and tactical understanding of his out-of-possession role that the managers he has played his best football under, namely Marcelo Bielsa and Gareth Southgate, value extremely highly. In 2020-21, he ranked sixth among players with 2,000 minutes to their name for the number of times he won possession per 90 (7.9), and 12th for tackles per 90 (2.7). Sitting so deep, West Ham naturally give up lots of territory, and therefore concede more chances than teams who defend on the front foot. Only rock-bottom Sheffield United have allowed their opponents more shots in open play (264) and in total (364) in the Premier League this season than West Ham (253 and 355), while only Sheffield United (42.7 xG) and 18th-placed Luton (40.8) have conceded more expected goals than West Ham (38.3). According to our expected goals on target model, only Luton’s Thomas Kaminski (6.5) and Tottenham’s Guglielmo Vicario (5.7) have prevented more goals with their shot-stopping this season than Alphonse Areola, suggesting they rely too much – or at least more than most – on their goalkeeper. Phillips provides another option in the deepest midfield role, where summer signing Edson Álvarez has been first choice this season. When he is out, though, Tomás Soucek is forced to play in a more defensive role than he is best suited to. It’s no coincidence that West Ham conceded 21 shots and 2.51 xG in Sunday’s draw with the league’s lowest scorers, Sheffield United, with a central midfield of Soucek and James Ward-Prowse. Both players prefer to play ahead of a number six with the freedom to get into attacking positions, as their combined return of 16 goal contributions (nine goals, seven assists) this season suggests. Phillips’ arrival could have the dual benefit of helping West Ham reduce the quantity of shots they concede, while also helping to get more from Soucek and Ward-Prowse in an attacking sense. From Phillips’ perspective, meanwhile, it is time for a move and time to play regular football, both to resurrect his career and increase his chances of starting for England at this summer’s Euros. Phillips has remained key for England throughout his City career, but even Southgate admitted late last year that the midfielder needs to be playing regularly in the second half of this season.  This is a deal that suits everyone. The prospect of seeing Phillips back to the player we saw at Leeds is a genuinely exciting one. Enjoy this?

And we’ve got the numbers to show you why. The group stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations fizzled out with a whimper. One goal across four games on the final day of action? Oh, great. But that soporific end belied the fact that this has been one of the most action-packed, drama-laden and exciting AFCON tournaments in history, one filled with goals, late thrills and giant killings. \\xa0 And we’ve got the numbers to show you why. We’ve already seen 89 goals at this year’s African Cup of Nations. That’s almost as many as in the entirety of the 2021 (100) and 2019 (102) editions. In fact, at a current goals-per-game rate of 2.47, it’s the highest-scoring tournament in 15 years, dating back to the goal-fest of 2008. Just four tournaments in the AFCON’s history (looking at tournaments consisting of 16 teams) have seen more goals scored per game. And before the lull on the final day of the group stage, the tournament had averaged 2.75 goals per game – tied for the third most in history. One noticeable thing during the last edition of the Africa Cup of Nations was a lack of long spells of possession for teams. The tournament’s group stage averaged under 12 sequences of 10+ passes per game, fewer than half seen at the UEFA European Championship in 2021 and lower than both Copa América in 2021 and the FIFA World Cup in 2022. And although AFCON 2023 still lags behind those other major tournaments by the same metric, we’ve seen a huge increase in the number of 10+ passing sequences per game, jumping up 31% to 15.2. Over the course of the entire 2021 edition, just three goals came from passing moves consisting of 10 passes or more. We’ve only just finished the group stage, but already the 2023 tournament has doubled that tally, with seven goals coming from 10+ passing moves. That points to an increase in the technical quality of the players participating at this year’s tournament and the more general numbers support that notion. This tournament is the first one in history to average over 600 successful passes per game… … while it is also the first tournament where passing accuracy has eclipsed 80%. The final set of fixtures in Group B encapsulated the madness of the group stage. With Ghana leading 2-0 against Mozambique, Egypt knew they needed to beat Cape Verde to qualify. Cue the emotional carnage then, when Mostafa Mohamed thought he’d scored a 93rd-minute winner for the Pharaohs, only for that elation to turn to horror as Cape Verde equalised in the 99th minute. Egypt were out. Or they would’ve been had Ghana not conspired to throw away their two-goal lead by conceding two stoppage-time goals against Mozambique. Instead, it was Ghana who were eliminated, with Egypt progressing as group runners-up. That crazy night in Group B gave us four goals in the 90th minute or beyond. Those were four of a whopping 13 stoppage-time goals we witnessed in the group stages alone this year, a figure that’s already more than twice as many as in every single edition since 2010. This tournament has three remarkable stories brewing. The first is the rise of Equatorial Guinea, who stunned everyone by finishing top of Group A ahead of hosts Ivory Coast and fellow African giants Nigeria. Juan Micha’s men owe much of their success to Emilio Nsue, who currently sits top of the goalscoring charts with five strikes. Equatorial Guinea have now reached the knockout stages in all four of their Africa Cup of Nations participations (2012, 2015, 2021 and 2023). Since the group stage was introduced in 1963, they are the only nation to play in more than one AFCON and reach the knockouts on every occasion. The second compelling narrative unfolding is that of Mauritania, who made history by claiming their first ever Africa Cup of Nations win against Algeria, condemning Riyad Mahrez and co to bottom spot in group D in the process. Mauritania hadn’t won any of their first eight games in the competition (D2 L6), and yet with their maiden win have now qualified for the knockout phase for the first time in three AFCON appearances. Algeria have now been eliminated at the Africa Cup of Nations group stage in two consecutive AFCON tournaments for the first time in their history (20 participations). The third fairy tale of AFCON 2023 involves Namibia, who also picked up their first ever tournament win by beating Tunisia 1-0 in their opening group game, in what was their 10th game in the competition. Despite it being the only goal they scored in Group E, Collin Benjamin’s side qualified for the last 16 as one of the best third-place teams, reaching the knockouts for the first time in their history. With some mouth-watering ties in the round of 16, we can only pray that we continue to see the same trends. Give us goals, give us late winners, give us a team firing their coach halfway through the tournament despite qualifying for the last 16 – oh, right. Above all, give us drama. Enjoy this?

We analysed the data to see if the criticism is justified or not. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe buying a significant stake in Manchester United and beginning to overhaul the club off the pitch, it would seem that at long last the Glazer era is coming to an end, but otherwise there have been few positives emanating from Old Trafford this season. After appearing to make progress on the pitch last term, in 2023-24 it feels as though they’ve taken two steps back. In pre-season, we identified several areas for improvement; while it’s difficult to conclude they’ve massively improved in any way since, one of the aspects of their game we highlighted back then was set-pieces. United’s record at corners was unimpressive in 2022-23, both attacking and defending, and they continue to be questioned about their methods in this area, particularly recently. In the 2-2 home draw with Tottenham earlier this month, United looked especially susceptible at corners. Not only was Spurs’ first goal, a Richarlison header, from such a scenario, but they went extremely close from two other similar situations as Diego Dalot cleared off the line and Cristian Romero headed against the crossbar. After the game, which was Ratcliffe’s first at Old Trafford since agreeing to buy a 25% stake the club in December, Erik ten Hag didn’t hide his frustration at how feeble United were defensively when facing corners. Asked what conclusions Ratcliffe might have come to during the match, Ten Hag told Sky Sports: “He will have seen a team fighting for each other and trying to get a win. He has seen two great goals on our side and also what he should have noticed is we should be more man when we have to defend corners. We should defend set-plays better. You have to grow up and be more physical, head the ball away. That [goal] shouldn’t happen.” It isn’t just corners; set-pieces in general have accounted for 23% of United’s overall expected goals against (xGA) in the Premier League this season, with only Liverpool (25%) seeing a greater proportion of their xGA attributed to set-plays. This supports the perception among United fans that they are simply poor at defending corners, so how bad is it really? At Opta Analyst, we’re lucky enough to have a treasure trove of immensely in-depth corner data that no one else has. Looking at one of the more rudimentary metrics available certainly doesn’t reflect well on United; just over half of the corners they’ve faced this season (50.4%) have been met first by one of their opponents, with only Bournemouth (54%) and Everton (59.5%) doing worse in this respect. Obviously, you can only read so much into this isolated statistic, but it’s not a great start, is it? It stands to reason that you might be more likely to concede from a corner if your opponents get to the delivery first. Similarly, 40.7% of the corners United have conceded also led to at least one shot by their opponents; Chelsea (44.9%), Luton Town (44.1%) and Tottenham (42.7%) are the only clubs less effective at preventing attempts at corners. Those shots against United have been worth 5.7 xG, the second-worst total in the Premier League ahead of only rock-bottom Sheffield United (6.7 xG). But we have to go back to the source and look at the bigger picture. United have conceded 135 corners in the Premier League this term, which is the third most behind Sheffield United (146) and Spurs (143). While the point remains regarding a high proportion of corners faced leading to shots, when you consider many other metrics in the context of United simply conceding a lot of set-plays, the numbers aren’t quite as damning. For instance, they’ve let in four goals that are deemed to have occurred in the passage of play following a corner. That equates to 2.96% of corners faced, with only five clubs seeing a smaller proportion of corners conceded lead to a goal concession. Arsenal have the poorest record in the Premier League in this respect. They’ve conceded the fewest corners (58) but five have resulted in a goal for their opponents; that’s 8.6%, putting them comfortably clear of every other team (Brighton are next on 6.3%). We can also break down the quality of chances teams have faced from corners a little further. So, while United’s 5.7 xGA is the second worst, the average xG value of those attempts is 0.091, putting them around mid-table in the Premier League. So, much of it simply comes down to the sheer number of corners they concede. Now, obviously having a better and more reliable defensive structure would help because in all likelihood they’d face fewer shots and therefore fewer shots that lead to a corner; their 317 attempts faced (including those blocked) is the fourth-most in the Premier League this term. After all, if the chances you concede at corners are roughly of the average quality, then facing lots of them is potentially asking for trouble. Nevertheless, while United’s record defending corners might not be as bad as the coverage of them recently has suggested (or just accentuated by the Tottenham performance), there are clearly still some areas for concern, mostly around first contact. David de Gea had rarely been convincing when coming for crosses or corners during his Manchester United career, so undoubtedly many United fans were hoping his eventual replacement would bring a little more reliability in that respect. That hasn’t yet come to pass with André Onana, whose unconvincing start to life at Old Trafford has contributed to him becoming something of a target for opponents. Teams crowding a goalkeeper isn’t anything new, nor is it a tactic that’s in any way unique to Onana, but teams facing United managed to get the first contact on 33.9% of inswinging corners, second only to West Ham (37.3%), which doesn’t reflect particularly well on either Onana’s command of his area nor United’s aerial ability in general. That’s also an issue seemingly impacting United at the other end of the pitch. Despite taking the fourth-most corners (134), United are one of only five teams yet to score a goal from their first contact at a corner this season. They have at least scored a couple of times in the passage of play following a corner, but generally speaking, the outlook is bleaker in terms of their productivity at offensive corners than it is defensive corners. While Arsenal have the best ratio of corners to goals from corners, scoring once every 16.4 corners on average, United’s record is among the worst, netting one goal for every 67 corners. That sees them rank 15th. Those two goals came from 3.1 xG, which obviously suggests an element of misfortune or wastefulness. But when we consider their xG output in the context of the total shots they’ve been presented with at corner situations, United’s stunted set-piece threat is really highlighted. The shots they’ve had at corners have an average xG value of just 0.06, which is the lowest of all 20 Premier League teams this season – it’s a damning summary of their work at corners, and arguably indicative of a lack of aerial prowess through the team, particularly if Harry Maguire and Casemiro aren’t playing. Maybe none of this is especially surprising, then. United aren’t a dominant, physical side and they’ve recorded more headed shots (34) – and goals (three) – than just four teams in 2023-24, and yet their proportion of outswinging corners (from crosses), which bend away from the danger zone, is among the highest partly due to how much time Luke Shaw has been out injured. One area we can highlight as a positive is short corners. United have managed to record at least one shot following 37% of their short-corner routines, which only four teams (minimum 10 short corners) can better. That’s also a greater proportion than United’s crossed corners leading to a shot (34.7%), suggesting they might do well to focus on more shorter, more subtle routines. But, at the same time, that feels like straw-clutching somewhat. The fact of the matter is, United’s output at attacking corners is among the poorest in the Premier League at the moment; considering they win more corners than almost every other team, this feels like a huge waste. Sure, their record when defending corners might not be as bad as you thought, but when considered in conjunction with how ineffective they are at attacking them, United’s room for improvement at set-pieces becomes abundantly clear.

Despite being 36 years old, he’d be a perfect January transfer for a Premier League club – we explain why. There’s no smoke without fire, and there’s been plenty of it billowing from the Karim Benzema rumour mill in the last few weeks, with the French striker reportedly unhappy at Al-Ittihad and looking for a move. After apparently reporting back for training 17 days later than expected, speculation is rife that the veteran striker might finally be heading to the Premier League in the January transfer window. Plenty seem to be disregarding the impact Benzema could have at a Premier League club, firstly due to his age (he turned 36 last month) and secondly because of a perceived lack of ‘top’ competitive action during his seven months in Saudi Arabia. But those doubters have too quickly forgotten the Frenchman’s qualities. Although it paled in comparison to his career-high 44 competitive goals for Real Madrid across 2021-22 as they won La Liga and the UEFA Champions League (helping him take the 2022 Ballon D’or), 2022-23 saw Benzema score 31 times for the Spanish giants – his second-best tally in a single season at the club. That 31-goal haul was only bettered by four players in the top five European leagues – Erling Haaland (52), Kylian Mbappé (41), Robert Lewandowski (33) and Harry Kane (32) – while Benzema scored one more than Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (30). Perhaps because of Madrid’s collective failure to win a single trophy last season, Benzema’s personal goalscoring feats were somewhat glossed over. After 14 seasons at the Santiago Bernabéu and with nothing left to prove, Benzema received a lucrative offer from Al-Ittihad and he decided it was time to leave. He departed Real Madrid with 354 goals and 142 assists (a total of 496 goal involvements), not to mention five Champions League crowns, four La Liga titles and three Copa del Rey successes. As expected from a player of the Benzema’s quality, he took little time to find form in the Saudi Pro League. With 14 goal involvements in 15 league appearances (nine goals, five assists), he’s topped the Al-Ittihad rankings, but just like at Real Madrid the season before, his personal performance has arguably been overshadowed by his team’s shortcomings. As last season’s SPL champions, Al-Ittihad were expected to be frontrunners again in 2023-24. That’s been far from the case, as they sit in seventh place with just over half (28) the points tally of leaders and rivals Al-Hilal (53). They’ve been a huge disappointment, all things considered. True, Benzema’s output has been overshadowed by the feats of Cristiano Ronaldo (not for the first time) as the Portugal great has produced 20 goals and nine more assists to lead the league rankings, but unlike the French striker, Ronaldo’s had time to acclimatise to Saudi football and the culture in general. With respect to his teammates at Al-Ittihad, Benzema’s had to deal with a drop in the level of quality that he’s used to working alongside since moving from Spain to Asia. One of Benzema’s greatest strengths is his ability to link play and take up the role of facilitator to help younger, quicker players blossom. We saw this in his final seasons at Madrid, using his nous to aid Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo develop into top-class forwards. In his final season at Real, among all La Liga players to play 3,000+ minutes in all competitions, only Toni Kroos (7.2) was involved in more open-play sequences that ended in a shot on a per-90-minute basis than Benzema (7.0). And just under half of the Frenchman’s involvements came in the build-up or chance creation of shots (3.3), rather than taking the shot itself (3.7). But which clubs might be able to offer him a route back to Europe? Outside of the Premier League, Benzema’s first club, Lyon, have reportedly tried to tempt their former star back to France. Benzema scored 66 goals in five professional seasons at his hometown club and Lyon certainly need a boost to fight off the threat of Ligue 1 relegation this season. With 16 points from their 18 league games, they are third from bottom and occupy the Ligue 1 relegation play-off spot. However much of a fairytale move that would be, it feels less likely than a switch to one of the three Premier League clubs supposedly interested in a loan deal for the striker. Arguably the most exciting prospect for Benzema this month would be joining Arsenal, where his abilities could be perfect for elevating Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli to new levels, while there’s little doubt that despite his advancing years, he’d be an upgrade on Gabriel Jesus. He’d bring regular goals, for a start. Jesus has scored just seven times in 1,366 minutes in all competitions this season – an average of one every 195 minutes, which is over two whole matches per goal. With the Premier League title race so tight this season, Benzema could make the difference for Mikel Arteta. Chelsea have the youngest Premier League side on average this season (24 years, 297 days), so adding some experience could help them to recover in the second half of the season and secure much-needed European qualification. Nicolas Jackson’s had a decent – if slightly erratic – start to life at Stamford Bridge with seven Premier League goals, but his wayward finishing has cost Chelsea at times in 2023-24. He’s underperformed his expected goals (xG) total by 3.6, but Benzema could help the Senegalese forward refine his game. Other than Jackson, Chelsea’s only other recognised strikers are Christopher Nkunku, who has only just returned from long-term injury, and Armando Broja, who has scored just once in 453 league minutes this season and that only came after Fulham’s Tim Ream kicked the ball onto his foot. And then there’s Manchester United. They’ve had an awful season in front of goal in 2023-24, with only three teams (Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sheffield United) scoring fewer than their 24 goals. Just four of those have come from Marcus Rashford, while 20-year-old summer signing Rasmus Højlund is still very much a work in progress and has scored just twice in the league. Anthony Martial is hardly worth mentioning as an option for Erik ten Hag such is his propensity to be out injured, with United confirming on Wednesday that he faces another 10 weeks out after surgery, so the signing of Benzema would be a huge improvement on their current roster of centre-forward options. Signing experienced strikers is a well-trodden path for United as well, and it’s quite often had positive results in the short term. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was 35 when he debuted for the club in the Premier League in October 2016 following his move from Paris Saint-Germain. His 28 goals across all competition in 2016-17 has been bettered on just nine occasions in the Premier League era by Man Utd players. Of course, the return of Ronaldo in 2021-22 was another such example. He was 36 when he rejoined the club and finished the campaign as their top scorer in both the league (18) and all competitions (24), although ultimately the return went sour in the second season. Benzema would presumably be signed on a shorter-term deal that could mean United avoid running into the same issues. Should Benzema leave Al-Ittihad this month and arrive in the Premier League, a decent half-season in England could even see him break into the top 10 for the niche ‘most goals scored aged 36 or older’ category, while Manchester United (35 goals) currently lead that ranking for Premier League clubs.

Bayer Neverkusen, sorry, Leverkusen top the Bundesliga, and they are dreaming of a historic first ever title. They have that ‘Neverkusen’ nickname for a reason. Leverkusen have finished in second place on five occasions, which is three more times than any other title-less side in Germany. All five of their runners-up medals have come in the last 30 years, meaning recent history is very much against them, too. And given only one letter had to be changed to reach the word ‘Neverkusen’, opposition fans couldn’t really resist the opportunity. But now, things might just be different. With serial winner Xabi Alonso – he of two Champions League wins, one in La Liga, three in the Bundesliga, two European Championships, one World Cup and a whole lot more as a player – at the helm, Leverkusen fans are hoping their team can finally lift the curse. At the weekend, they took a big step towards doing just that. A week earlier, they had confirmed their place at the top of the table at the halfway stage for the third time in their history. They were midway through the 2023-24 campaign and, incredibly, still remained unbeaten. And yet, while some might have considered that important, this weekend felt even more significant. On both previous occasions that Leverkusen had previously been top of the Bundesliga at the midway point, they fell away and finished second, doing so in 2002 and 2009. In 2002, they were also runners-up in the DFB-Pokal and the Champions League. Their reputation as Germany’s nearly men really is justified. They required a 94th-minute winner to overcome mid-table Augsburg in their first game after the winter break, with that skin-of-their-teeth win coming a day after Bayern Munich had brushed Hoffenheim aside, winning 3-0. It meant Leverkusen were top of the table after 17 of 34 games, but it hadn’t felt entirely convincing, and the jubilant celebrations that met Exequiel Palacios’ late winner reflected a relief at not having dropped points. Yes, they were still top, but a reality in which Bayern, four points behind Leverkusen with a game in hand, ate up the points difference still seemed like the most likely eventuality. But after this weekend’s results, there appears to be more reason to think that this really could be Leverkusen’s year. Facing a tricky trip to RB Leipzig, Alonso’s men rode their luck for long periods and spent much of the first period camped deep inside their half. They created very little before the break – generating just 0.25 expected goals (xG) – and went behind to Xavi Simons’ fantastic early opener. They dug in, though, and made it to half-time one goal down and still in the game. Alonso’s side came out for the second half firing, and Nathan Tella levelled the game after ghosting in at the back post to tap in Álex Grimaldo’s low cross. Leverkusen pushed for a second, but were hit on the break when Loïs Openda put Leipzig back in front. But this Leverkusen team never give up and they scored two set-piece goals – the second in the 91st minute from Piero Hincapié – to earn a genuinely momentous victory against one of the Bundesliga’s Champions League hopefuls. Wild celebrations at the final whistle felt like much more than relief this time. Alone, it was a hugely consequential result. But when, the next day, Bayern followed it up by falling to a shock defeat at home to struggling Werder Bremen, Leverkusen’s last-gasp win at Leipzig became genuinely critical in the title race. The weekend’s results were so significant, in fact, that for the first time this season, the all-knowing Opta supercomputer says Bayern are no longer favourites for the title. Leverkusen win the Bundesliga title in 57.8% of the supercomputer’s latest round of season simulations, compared to 42.1% for Bayern. Bayern’s title chances had not previously dropped below 50% all season. Of course, there’s a great deal of time left and a lot of football to be played, and – we’re sorry to bring you this news – the supercomputer can’t actually predict the future.  But the fact that an objective model would now deem the winners of the last 11 Bundesliga titles to be outsiders – less likely to win the league than the team who can’t buy a winners’ medal – is unquestionably significant. So, can Bayer Leverkusen really win a first ever Bundesliga title this year? Well, any team that goes through 18 games undefeated in one of Europe’s major leagues has to be a very good side, and there is clearly more than just a good run of form at play here. Alonso has built a fantastic team, and many of his signings have been extremely astute. Granit Xhaka (€25m), Victor Boniface (€20m), Jonas Hofmann (€10m) and Grimaldo (free) all arrived in the summer and look like bargains considering how important they’ve been this season. Boniface is the only one of them who hasn’t played in all of Leverkusen’s league games, and he has only missed the last two through injury. Under Alonso, who had so much success as a player in that iconic Spain team, Leverkusen unsurprisingly play a possession-heavy, high-pressing brand of football. They’ve had more possession (61.5%) than every other Bundesliga team this season, making them the first team to rank higher than Bayern for possession in any Bundesliga season since Werder did 16 years ago in 2007-08. Leverkusen dominate the ball right across the pitch, only seeing significantly less of it (45% or lower) than their opponents in the central part the opposition’s penalty area, as the below graphic shows. They have put together more open-play sequences of 10 or more passes (405) than any other team, with the average length of their sequences (4.96 passes per sequence) longer than everyone else as well. There is end product to their passing, too, with Leverkusen enjoying more sequences of 10+ passes that end in a shot or touch in the opposition’s penalty area (94) than any other team. No other Bundesliga team can better their seven goals from such sequences, either (Bayern also seven). Without the ball, they have won back possession within 40 metres of their opponents’ goal at least 20 times more than any other team (191), and they also rank first for high turnovers leading to a shot (36). With four goals directly resulting from high turnovers, they rank second to VfB Stuttgart. Their goals have been spread throughout the team as well, with five players having reached five goals for the season already; no other Bundesliga team has more than three. Those five players have also all registered six or more assists, too; only 10 Bundesliga players have at least five goals and six assists this season, meaning Leverkusen account for half of those players alone. Meanwhile, at the other end, they have the best defence in the league, with just 14 goals conceded in 18 games, and a remarkably low eight goals shipped in open play. It does appear as though there is something sustainable here; far more than the nature of their two most recent, last-gasp wins suggests. It appears there is more than mere gut feeling to our supercomputer’s predictions. A couple of key absentees might help to explain why Leverkusen hadn’t been at their best since the winter break. They have been without top scorer Boniface, who has missed out on representing Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations due to injury. Leverkusen also had more players called up to the tournament than any other Bundesliga team, with Edmond Tapsoba, Odilon Kossounou and Amine Adli all competing in Ivory Coast. It was always going to take some time to adjust to playing without Boniface in particular, while Tapsoba’s absence will naturally affect how fluently they build up, as well as how well they defend. Playing without two key players has also accentuated the extremes in their reliance on leaving it late and scoring from set-pieces. Much of Leverkusen’s success this season has been built on their strong performances after the break. Based on the scores in the second halves of games this season, Leverkusen have 10 more points than any other team. That might reflect their tendency to start more slowly than, say, Bayern, who will regularly be two goals up inside 25 minutes and not need to ‘win’ the second half, but it also highlights an ability to go the distance, as well as a togetherness, belief and depth in the squad. The two recent injury-time winners are simply a byproduct of the team taking a little longer than usual to click; they are their only 90th-minute winners all season. Meanwhile, their 11 goals from set-pieces is the joint most in the Bundesliga alongside Heidenheim, and they could become an even more important route to goal in the coming weeks. With their first team disrupted for a few more games at least with Tapsoba’s Burkina Faso heading for the knockout rounds at AFCON 2023 and Boniface set to miss most of the rest of the season, set-piece goals will remain crucial. Any team needs a fair bit of luck to win a title, and a team like Leverkusen need even more to upset the Bundesliga status quo and disrupt Bayern’s monopoly. Our expected points model, which uses expected goals numbers to try and work out how each match ‘should’ have ended based on the quality of chances each team had, suggests Leverkusen should actually be third in the table.  But more scrappy and sometimes undeserved wins will be required if Leverkusen are to win the title, and they shouldn’t take too much notice of this kind of table. In Xhaka, they have a player who found out last season just how difficult it is to sustain a title challenge against a behemoth like Bayern, as part of an Arsenal team who stumbled in the Premier League’s final weeks and lost the title race with Manchester City. There are a few similarities between Arsenal’s title challenge of 2022-23 and Leverkusen’s this season, so Alonso will hope his midfielder can pass on any lessons he learned to his new teammates. Now favourites to win the title, this Leverkusen squad can start believing they can win their first Bundesliga title this summer. Do that, and they will banish the ‘Neverkusen’ moniker forever.

With Mohamed Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations, everyone – including us – asked where Liverpool’s goals would come from without their star man. Diogo Jota saw it all and said: “Hold my Super Bock.” After Liverpool had beaten Arsenal in the FA Cup and Fulham in the EFL Cup without Salah, they faced Bournemouth on Sunday in what was their first Premier League game without the Egyptian since May 2022 when they defeated Southampton 2-1 at St Mary’s. With the score 0-0 at half-time at the Vitality Stadium, thoughts were already heading towards whether this was proof that Liverpool would struggle to find the net without Salah. The second half swiftly removed those concerns as Jürgen Klopp’s men secured a 4-0 win to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to five points. Central to that second-half haul was Jota, who set up Darwin Núñez neatly for the first, before two clinical strikes of his own put the game to bed. Núñez added a late fourth, but it was the Portugal international who garnered most of the post-match attention for his contributions. For his first strike against Andoni Iraola’s previously in-form side, Jota ran onto a pass from Cody Gakpo down Liverpool’s right before firing first time in off Neto’s near post. His second arrived via a cut-back from Conor Bradley as Jota made a mess of his first effort, before silencing mockery from the Bournemouth fans by slamming his second attempt low into the far corner. They were both typical Jota finishes, instinctive but with tremendous authority and assuredness. The 27-year-old told Sky Sports after the win when asked about his finishing: “It’s hard to explain, I try to be in the right place at the right time and that’s why I work. “This kind of feeling, it just comes natural and that’s why I need to be there to help the team to score goals and make assists.” Jamie Carragher put forward the idea after the game that Jota might be Liverpool’s most natural finisher of the Premier League era. It was quite the compliment comparing Jota to players such as Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Fernando Torres, Luis Suárez, Daniel Sturridge and Salah. Is @DiogoJota18 @LFC best finisher in the PL era 🤷\\u200d♂️ It’s not an outrageous question, either. Looking at the numbers, plenty of Jota’s stats measure up against those club greats. It should be pointed out that it’s tricky to judge him against the records of Fowler and Owen because Opta has only collected shot data since 2003-04. However, we can confirm that Fowler averaged a goal every 159 minutes in the Premier League, and Owen found the net on average every 143 minutes. Jota currently edges both with an average of a goal every 141 minutes. That is behind Suárez (139), Sturridge (136), Salah (132) and Torres (121), though Jota’s shot conversion rate is ahead of each of those four. In fact, since shot data has been available in the Premier League, of players to score 20+ goals for Liverpool, only Divock Origi (20.8%) has a better shot conversion percentage than Jota’s 19.3% (38 goals from 197 total shots). That puts the former Wolves man ahead of Suárez (12.5%), Sturridge (15.3%), Salah (17.4%), Torres (17.9%) and Sadio Mané (18.6%). Liverpool’s signing of Jota from Wolves in September 2020 raised a few eyebrows. With Salah, Mané and Roberto Firmino considered to be one of the best attacking trios in world football, adding Jota for a reported fee of up to £45 million came somewhat out of the blue. The Portugal international had impressed at Molineux but was largely overshadowed by Raúl Jiménez, Wolves’ star striker at the time. Jota scored 16 goals in 67 Premier League games (56 starts) for Wolves before moving to Anfield but had a shot conversion rate of just 12.6%, showing how much he has improved his finishing in a Liverpool shirt. It wasn’t gradual either; his Premier League shot conversion percentage in his first season went straight up to 19.6% (nine goals from 46 shots), reducing slightly to 16.7% in 2021-22 (15 goals from 90 shots). Last season was disrupted by injury, but he still managed seven goals from 35 shots (20%). He has already matched that goal tally this season (seven goals from 26 shots – 26.9%). His seven Premier League goals this season have come from an expected goals total (xG) of just 3.27. Of players to have scored at least seven in England’s top flight in 2023-24, none have a lower xG (Chris Wood is the next lowest with eight goals from 5.35 xG). In all competitions, Jota has an even more impressive 11 goals from 5.34 xG. Not including blocked shots, Jota has scored with seven of his 11 shots on target. As is evident in the graphic below, he has mostly been finding the bottom corners, while his overall goalmouth shot location graphic below that shows how varied his finishing has been. In fact, since arriving at Liverpool, Jota has only underperformed his Premier League xG in one of four seasons when he scored 15 goals from 16.67 xG in 2021-22. Jota’s signing was somewhat overshadowed back in 2020, coming just 24 hours after the capture of Thiago Alcântara from Bayern Munich. It had come from nowhere, but the club’s data-driven recruitment team had earned the benefit of the doubt. The same people who had helped build a team that won the UEFA Champions League and Premier League had made another recommendation, and it wasn’t long before people saw what they saw. Jota scored on his Premier League debut for the club, neatly controlling and volleying a finish in at the Kop end in a 3-1 win over Arsenal. An impressive hat-trick at Atalanta in the Champions League soon followed, while he recorded a goal in each of his first four Premier League outings at Anfield (vs Arsenal, Sheffield United, West Ham and Leicester City). In Liverpool’s busy 2021-22 campaign, winning the EFL Cup and FA Cup, reaching the Champions League final and finishing second in the Premier League with 92 points, Jota scored 21 goals in 55 games (39 starts). One of those goals came in the 2-2 draw at title rivals Manchester City in April 2022. It would be his last for over a year. Injury in that period didn’t help, but by the time Jota scored his first of two goals in Liverpool’s 6-1 win at Leeds United in April 2023 he had gone 372 days and 32 games without finding the net. He has been back to his best since then, though, scoring 18 goals in 31 games (18 starts) in all competitions at club level since (and including) his goals at Leeds. Overall, he has 38 goals in 91 Premier League games for Liverpool (60 starts) and 52 goals in 135 games (86 starts) in all competitions. Interestingly, both of Jota’s goals at Bournemouth came when he moved over to the right, which proved he can still be deadly on that side despite having hardly ever played there.  The graphic below shows all of his Premier League goals for Liverpool, and the two grouped close together furthest to the right of the penalty area are his strikes against Bournemouth. This season, Jota has been even more lethal than Salah in terms of conversion rate. His 26.2% shot conversion percentage in all competitions is ahead of the Egyptian (21.7%), as well as Cody Gakpo (19.6%), Luis Díaz (13.3%) and Núñez (11%). His goals are often important ones, too. Of Jota’s 38 Premier League goals, 12 have been opening goals, 12 have been winners, 16 have put Liverpool one goal ahead and six have been equalisers. Of his 14 goals in cup competitions, six have been openers and six have been winners.  It often happens with elite finishers, but Jota doesn’t just score goals; he often does so at crucial times. His dramatic late winner in the 4-3 win over Tottenham at Anfield last season is a good example of his calmness in key moments. As his celebration of that goal made reference to, Jota is also an accomplished player of EA Sports FC 24 and often makes finishing look as easy as if he had a headset on and a controller in his hands. Is Diogo Jota Liverpool’s best finisher of the Premier League era? There isn’t a way to state that definitively, but that he’s even in the conversation is something few would have anticipated when he arrived from Wolves in 2020. Continue to find the net with regularity and help Liverpool to more trophies, and Jota will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the club’s great forwards, placing him among some incredibly esteemed company.

Our latest edition includes numbers on Liverpool without Mohamed Salah and Arsenal’s success from corners. We had the other half of Matchday 21 in the Premier League at the weekend, and it threw up plenty more stories in just five games. Arsenal and Liverpool walloped Crystal Palace and Bournemouth respectively, Ivan Toney returned with a goal as Brentford beat Nottingham Forest, Oli McBurnie scored the latest goal in Premier League history to rescue a point for Sheffield United against West Ham, while James Milner became the outright second-highest appearance maker in Premier League history in Brighton’s goalless draw with Wolves. The Gunners kicked things off with a routine thrashing of a beleaguered Palace, including two more goals from corners. We’ve analysed just how good Arsenal are at getting the ball in the net from such situations. We start by looking at Premier League leaders Liverpool, though, who are coping just fine without their star man. If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week.  There is no denying that Mohamed Salah is a key player for Liverpool. The Egypt international has scored goals left, right and centre for the Reds in recent years, and had 18 to his name in all competitions this season before he left for the Africa Cup of Nations. While away at the tournament, Salah sustained a muscle injury that his club confirmed on Monday is “worse than first feared”, with his agent suggesting he could be out for up to a month. Disaster, right? Well, maybe not because so far, Liverpool have been absolutely fine without him. Three games in three competitions sans Salah this season have produced three wins – 2-0 away to Arsenal in the FA Cup, a 2-1 first-leg victory against Fulham in the EFL Cup semi-final, and now Sunday’s 4-0 triumph at Bournemouth in the Premier League. So, is Salah just massively overrated and a gigantic fraud? (We hear rival fans crossing their fingers and toes.) No, of course not, but it is testament to Jürgen Klopp’s side and their ability to find ways to win without their talisman. Diogo Jota and Darwin Núñez stepped up on Sunday with two goals apiece at Bournemouth. Salah doesn’t miss many games through injury, though a muscle issue suffered at AFCON will see him return to his club in the interim to undergo rehab. Since Salah arrived at Anfield in 2017, he has featured in 332 of their 366 games in all competitions. Liverpool have won 209 of the 332 games Salah has played a part in (D69 L54), a win percentage of 63%. Without him, they have won 24 of 34 (D7 L3), a win percentage of 70.6%. Surely they score more goals with him, though? Well, no. They average 2.2 goals per game whether with or without the former Chelsea man. Obviously given the small sample size, these are not defining numbers, and several of the games he missed were cup games against lesser opposition. It would be a safe bet that if Liverpool played another 298 games without Salah, their win percentage would be unlikely to stay as high. Sunday’s victory at the Vitality Stadium was the first Premier League game Salah has missed since a 2-1 win at Southampton in May 2022. Liverpool have lost none of their 11 Premier League games without him (W8 D3) since he arrived from Roma in 2017, winning each of the last five. Klopp’s men have proven they aren’t a one-man team, though will still be a lot happier when they have the Egyptian King back in action. Whenever that may be. There has been a lot of talk recently about Arsenal’s lack of goals this season. Ahead of Saturday’s game against Crystal Palace, the Gunners had scored 37 times in 20 games. Their 5-0 hammering of Palace helped give their goal difference a much-needed boost in the race for the Premier League title, and it all began with a familiar route to goal. Of Arsenal’s 42 league goals this season, almost a quarter (10) have come from corners, with no team having scored from as many in England’s top flight in 2023-24. The trick to their success could be consistency. Mikel Arteta’s men like to take in-swinging corners. In fact, they really like it. They have had more corners than any other Premier League team this season (164) and have crossed the ball straight into the penalty area from 136 of those. Of those 136, 135 have been in-swingers, with just one solitary out-swinger (which presumably was a mis-hit or got caught by the wind). It’s not just the direction of the swing, but where the ball ends up. As you can see from the below bonus viz, a significant number of their corners are aimed at the near post. And as you can see below from another bonus viz (we’re being very generous this week, aren’t we?) just 15% of their corners have been sent to the back-post zone close to goal. However, their first two goals against Palace came from corners sent into that area, with Gabriel getting on the end of both, even though the second ultimately went down as a Dean Henderson own goal. Much has been said about the impact of set-piece coach Nicolas Jover, and whatever he is doing seems to be working. As well as scoring the most goals from corners in the Premier League this season, Arsenal have had the most successful crosses from corners (40). Perhaps unsurprisingly, they have the highest expected assists (xA) from corners (3.05), ahead of second-placed West Ham (2.35). The lesson to be learned? Try not to concede corners against Arsenal.

We look ahead to one of the two games with our Tanzania vs DR Congo prediction and preview. There is all to play for in Group F, with three of the four teams still able to finish top of the group, and all four teams able to qualify for the knockout round in second place. Tanzania have it all to do, though, heading into Matchday 3 bottom of the pile having taken just one point from their first two matches. They will need their first win at any AFCON tournament to jump up the table and make it out of the group. They have drawn two and lost six of their eight AFCON games up to this point. They did, however, take the lead in their last game – a 1-1 draw with Zambia – which was only the third time they have ever gone ahead in an AFCON game. What’s more, the other two occasions both came in the same game, and they ended up losing that match – a 3-2 defeat to Kenya in the 2019 edition. DR Congo have drawn both of their games at AFCON 2023 and sit level with Zambia in Group F with identical records. If Morocco beat Zambia in the other match in the group, DR Congo will only need a point against Tanzania to confirm second place. They won’t want to rely on other results, though, and should be confident that they can get the win they need here. They did exceptionally well to battle back from a goal down against World Cup semi-finalists Morocco last time out, recovering from the setback of Cédric Bakambu missing a first-half penalty to secure a well-earned point. They created more than enough to deserve a draw in that game against very strong opposition. They may have a historically poor AFCON record, having won only four of their last 2022 games at the tournament, but they have plenty of quality in their ranks, including Brentford’s Yoann Wissa and former West Ham man Arthur Masuaku. This will be the first-ever meeting between the teams at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament. DR Congo won their most recent meeting – a 3-0 victory in a World Cup qualifier in November 2021. DR Congo are favourites to win this match, with the Opta supercomputer playing out a win that would take them through to the knockout round in 48.1% of its 10,000 pre-match simulations. Tanzania have a decent chance of an upset, though, winning 27.4% of the time. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Tanzania: Beno Kakolanya, Aishi Manula, Kwesi Kawawa, Dickson Job, Abdi Banda, Ibrahim Hamad, Abdulmalik Zakaria, Mohamed Hussein, Bakari Mwamnyeto, Miano van den Bos, Lusajo Mwaikenda, Haji Mnoga, Mudathir Yahya, Feisal Salum, Charles M’Mombwa, Novatus Miroshi, Sospeter Bajana, Himid Mao, Mohammed Sagaf, Mzamiru Yassin, Morice Abraham, Kibu Denis,\\xa0Tarryn Allarakhia, Cyprian Kachwele, Mbwana Samatta, Simon Msuva, Ben Starkie.\\xa0 Coach: Adel Amrouche\\xa0 DR Congo:\\xa0Baggio Siadi, Lionel Mpasi, Dimitry Bertaud, Arthur Masuaku, Henock Inonga, Chancel Mbemba, Rocky Bushiri, Joris Kayembe, Dylan Batubinsika, Gédéon Kalulu, Gaël Kakuta, Brian Bayeye, Grady Diangana, Samuel Moutoussamy, Aaron Tshibola, Charles Pickel, Yoane Wissa, Simon Banza, Meschack Elia, Fiston Mayele, Théo Bongonda, Silas Katompa Mvumpa, Cédric Bakambu.

We look ahead to the game with our Zambia vs Morocco prediction and preview. Zambia and Morocco battle it out on Wednesday night with qualification for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations last 16 firmly in their sights.  Zambia’s last win at the AFCON still dates back to 2012 when they beat Ghana 1-0 in the semi-finals. They, of course, went on to lift the trophy in the final – beating Ivory Coast on penalties – but that game is one of eight draws they’ve played out in their last nine matches, losing the other against Cape Verde in 2015.  This year has been no different, with their two opening games ending in 1-1 draws against DR Congo and Tanzania. The latter was a particularly disappointing result given Avram Grant’s side were decent favourites to win that match. Instead, they required a late Patson Daka header to save a point after defender Rodrick Kabwe had been dismissed just before half-time.  Daka has been involved in both of Zambia’s goals at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (1 goal, 1 assist). He’s the first Zambian player to score and assist at an AFCON tournament since 2012, when Christopher Katongo, Stoppila Sunzu and Rainford Kalaba all did so. The scenario for Zambia is simple: they need to win to guarantee qualification for the last 16. A draw won’t necessarily eliminate them, but DR Congo are favourites against Tanzania, and three points in total will leave it touch-and-go as to whether they qualify as one of the best third-placed teams.  Morocco came into this tournament as our third favourites and started brightly, easily brushing aside Tanzania 3-0 in their first game.  The Atlas Lions found the going much harder against a competitive DR Congo side, having to make do with a point. Achraf Hakimi got his side off to a fast start with a goal after five minutes and 43 seconds – the quickest goal for Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations since Soufiane Alloudi scored against Namibia in 2008 in the first and fifth minute of the game – but Silas Katompa Mvumpa netted a deserved equaliser.  Morocco certainly rode their luck, with DR Congo’s Cédric Bakambu missing a first-half penalty. With four points, Morocco have already qualified for the last 16 but will want to ensure they finish top of Group F to give themselves the best possible draw.  This will be the third encounter between Zambia and Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations. Both previous meetings came in the group stages: Morocco won 1-0 in 1986 before a draw in 1998 (1-1). Zambia and Morocco’s last encounter was in the African Nations Championship in January 2021, with Morocco winning 3-1 in Cameroon. The Opta supercomputer makes Morocco strong favourites for this contest, giving them a 60.7% chance of taking all three points and finishing as Group F winners. Zambia are given a 18.5% chance of causing an upset, while the draw comes in at a 20.8% likelihood.  After Ivory Coast’s early stutters, Morocco have moved up into second place in our overall AFCON 2023 predictions. At the time of writing they have a 14.4% chance of lifting the trophy, behind favourites Senegal (17.9%). The model thinks there is a 79.7% chance the Atlas Lions top their group, while it gives Zambia a 40.8% chance of qualifying for the knockout stage. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Zambia: Toaster Nsabata, Lawrence Mulenga, Francis Mwansa, Stoppila Sunzu, Lubambo Musonda, Benson Sakala, Gift Mphande, Dominic Chanda, Tandi Mwape, Benedict Chepeshi, Frankie Musonda, Zephaniah Phiri, Emmanuel Banda, Roderick Kabwe, Kings Kangwa, Clatous Chama, Rally Bwalya, Lameck Banda, Frederick Mulambia, Kelvin Kampamba, Golden Mafwenta, Kelvin Kapumbu, Miguel Chaiwa, Fashion Sakala, Edward Chilufya, Patson Daka, Kennedy Musonda.\\xa0 Coach: Avram Grant\\xa0 Morocco: Munir Mohamedi, Yassine Bounou, Mehdi Benabid, Nayef Aguerd, Achraf Hakimi, Romain Saïss, Chadi Riad, Yahya Attiat-Allah, Abdel Abqar, Yunis Abdelhamid, Noussair Mazraoui, Mohamed Chibi, Sofyan Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Amir Richardson, Selim Amallah, Oussama El Azzouzi, Amine Harit, Azzedine Ounahi, Bilal El Khannouss, Sofiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri, Abde Ezzalzouli, Ismael Saibari, Tarik Tissoudali, Amine Adli, Ayoub El Kaabi.\\xa0 Coach: Walid Regragui\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Look ahead to a potentially dramatic conclusion with our South Africa vs Tunisia prediction and preview. As underwhelming as Tunisia’s record at the Africa Cup of Nations was before this tournament began, they were firm favourites to top Group E and few would’ve predicted them being bottom heading into Matchday 3. That’s the reality, though; they must beat South Africa on Wednesday to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage. Even though pre-tournament expectations for Tunisia weren’t especially high, they have been disappointing. A 1-1 draw with Mali on Matchday 2 was hardly emphatic but at least prevented an additional loss of dignity after they were beaten 1-0 in their opener by Namibia, among the least-fancied teams in the whole competition. Either way, the fact the Eagles of Carthage were unable to beat Mali last time out leaves them in a precarious position. With one point from two games and third-placed Namibia on three, a draw simply won’t be enough for Tunisia to claw themselves off the foot of Group E. Anything other than a win and they’ll be heading home early. They could certainly have picked more straightforward opposition for such a vital match, though Bafana Bafana’s own record at the AFCON in recent tournaments is by no means impressive. South Africa haven’t won successive games at the Africa Cup of Nations since 2000, so it’s fair to suggest Tunisia aren’t completely devoid of hope. On Matchday 2, Hugo Broos’ men did what Tunisia couldn’t when confidently sweeping aside Namibia, running out 4-0 winners. An early Percy Tau penalty was followed by a Themba Zwane brace to put South Africa in complete control by half-time. The exciting Thapelo Maseko then rounded things off in the second half with his first goal for the senior side. That put South Africa in a far more comfortable position, though they too cannot afford to relax. While three points could be enough to qualify as one of the four best third-placed teams, they could yet finish bottom of the group if they lose and Namibia earn a point against Mali in the group’s other game. It’s all still to play for, and that might just lead to a thrilling finale in Group E on Wednesday. South Africa and Tunisia are well acquainted with each other as this will be their fifth meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bafana Bafana prevailed in both of their knockout encounters: the 1996 final (2-0) and third-place match in 2000 (2-2 aet, 4-3 pens); meanwhile, Tunisia were victorious in their two group matches: 2006 (2-0) and 2008 (3-1). In fact, ahead of this match, South Africa have only faced Morocco (five times) on more occasions in the Africa Cup of Nations. Despite an unimpressive start to this tournament, Tunisia are considered the favourites for this clash, winning 47.8% of the Opta supercomputer’s 10,000 pre-match simulations. Nevertheless, at 27.7%, South Africa won over a quarter of the simulations, meaning they shouldn’t necessarily be overlooked. The draw occurred 24.5% of the time. Tunisia’s most-likely final group position is last place (57.4%), meaning the supercomputer clearly thinks they are fighting a losing battle in their attempts to stay in the tournament. South Africa, on the other hand, finish second and secure a place in the next round in 39.5% of the competition simulations. As such, South Africa’s chances of going all the way have increased slightly since our pre-tournament predictions were published, though Tunisia’s have unsurprisingly dropped considerably. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the supercomputer.

We look ahead to the EFL Cup semi-final second leg with our Fulham vs Liverpool prediction and preview. Liverpool overcame an early scare in the first leg of this EFL Cup semi-final tie at Anfield, coming from behind to take a 2-1 lead to London for Wednesday’s return match. Still battling on four fronts, they are taking the competition seriously once again. Willian had put Fulham into a shock first-half lead, but goals from Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo after the break turned the game and the tie on its head. Liverpool weren’t quite at full strength for the game, but it was the second time this season that Fulham have caused them real problems, and Liverpool shouldn’t be taking anything for granted here. In December, Liverpool beat Fulham 4-3 at Anfield, but Marco Silva’s side had come from behind twice to take a 3-2 lead with only 10 minutes of the game remaining, only for Wataru Endo and Trent Alexander-Arnold to score twice in two minutes to secure a dramatic home win. Fulham clearly have more than enough to cause Liverpool problems and here, on home soil, they will fancy their chances of an upset. They don’t have history on their side, though. Liverpool have progressed to the final on eight of the nine previous occasions they’ve won the first leg of an EFL Cup semi-final tie. The exception was in 1997-98, when they were eliminated by Middlesbrough after winning the first leg at Anfield 2-1. The Reds just need a draw to progress to what would be a record 14th League Cup final – at least four more than any other side. Meanwhile, Fulham have never reached the League Cup final. They would be the 37th different team to reach the final of the competition, and first maiden finalists since Bradford and Swansea in 2012-13.\\xa0However, only 25% of teams to lose the first leg of a semi-final tie have reached the final (23/92). It also doesn’t bode well that Fulham are winless in their last five home games against Liverpool since a 1-0 victory in December 2011.  In terms of team news, there could be good news for Fulham, with Adama Traoré hoping to overcome a hamstring injury in time to play here. Tim Ream should also be available after he missed the defeat to Chelsea on the first weekend of the split Premier League MD 21, with Fulham having enjoyed a full week off in the lead-up to this match. Calvin Bassey, Alex Iwobi and Fodé Ballo-Touré are all away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Liverpool will soon have Mohamed Salah back at the club from AFCON duty, but unfortunately for them that is only because they want to assess and treat the muscle injury he sustained while playing in Ivory Coast. Curtis Jones should be in contention despite picking up what manager Jürgen Klopp described as a “niggle” in Sunday’s win over Bournemouth. There is also good news in the form of Andy Robertson making his long-awaited return from a shoulder injury. Pep Lijnders confirmed on Tuesday that the Scot would be in the squad on Wednesday night, though the game comes slightly too soon for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dominik Szoboszlai. Although Liverpool have had the better of recent meetings between these sides, they have invariably been close games. Not since a 2-0 win for Liverpool in November 2018 – eight meetings ago – has a match between these teams been won by more than one goal. However, Fulham have only won one of those games (a 1-0 win at Anfield in March 2021), and have lost four of them. Fulham haven’t beaten Liverpool at home since December 2011, losing three and drawing two of the five meetings since then.  Fulham come into the game in unpredictable form. They have won only two of their last eight games – those coming against title-chasing Arsenal in the Premier League and Championship side Rotherham in the FA Cup – losing five and drawing one. Liverpool, meanwhile, are on a fine run, with Sunday’s 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth their fifth successive win in all competitions and their eighth game without defeat. In fact, they have only lost three matches all season – two in the Europa League and one in the Premier League when they were reduced to nine men at Tottenham. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides. Even though they only need a draw to progress to the final, the Opta supercomputer predicts Liverpool will win this second leg inside 90 minutes. They won the match in 59.3% of the supercomputer’s simulations. Fulham got the win they need to, at the very least, take the tie to extra-time in 19.8% of simulations. A draw, which would see Fulham dumped out, occurred 20.9% of the time.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to third against first with our Namibia vs Mali prediction and preview. Ghana’s dramatic draw with Mozambique on Monday took some of the jeopardy out of this game, with Mali now guaranteed a place in the knockout stage. They will still want to ensure top spot in Group E and Namibia will be hoping to secure their own place in the last 16. It will be a big ask for Collin Benjamin’s men to win and leapfrog Mali in the group, with the Eagles unbeaten in nine group stage games at the Africa Cup of Nations (W5 D4), losing just one of their last 15 such games (W5 D9). Mali followed up a 2-0 win over South Africa on Matchday 1 with a 1-1 draw against Tunisia. Their four points is enough to sit top of Group E heading into MD 3. Kamory Doumbia has assisted two of Mali’s three goals so far at AFCON 2023 (both for Lassine Sinayoko). No Mali player has ever assisted three goals in a single edition of the tournament on record (since 2010). Namibia have a good chance of joining Mali in the knockout stage, though a 4-0 hammering by South Africa damaged their goal difference on MD 2. It was hardly an ideal way to follow up their impressive 1-0 win over Tunisia in their first game. Namibia’s Peter Shalulile will be hoping to have more luck in front of goal. He has attempted six shots (three on target) at AFCON 2023 across the first two matchdays, with only Algeria’s Youcef Belaïli (eight) having had more shots without scoring in the competition. This will be the first-ever meeting between Namibia and Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations. The last meeting between the two came in an AFCON qualifier in November 2020 in Windhoek, with Mali winning 2-1 thanks to goals from Sékou Koïta and Moussa Doumbia. Mali had also beaten Namibia in the reverse fixture 1-0 just four days prior. The Opta supercomputer believes Mali will cement their place at the top of Group E with a win. The Eagles have a 53.4% chance of victory, with Namibia given a 23.6% likelihood. The draw is rated at 23.0%.  In our pre-tournament predictions, Mali were given just a 3.7% chance of lifting the trophy. That has risen slightly, while they have a near one-in-four chance of reaching the semi-finals. Namibia are considered likelier to advance to the knockout stage than not. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Namibia: Edward Maova, Kamaijanda Ndisiro, Lloyd Kazapua, Ivan Kamberipa, Denzil Haoseb, Ryan Nyambe, Kennedy Amutenya, Riaan Hanamub, Lubeni Haukongo, Charles Hambira, Aprocius Petrus, Joslin Kamatuka, Petrus Shitembi, Deon Hotto, Ngero Katua, Ananias Gebhardt, Absalom Iimbondi, Marcell Papama, Bethuel Muzeu, Peter Shalulile, Prins Tjiueza, Wendell Rudath, Uetuuru Kambato.\\xa0 Coach: Collin Benjamin Mali: Djigui Diarra, Aboubacar Doumbia, Ismaël Diawara, Mamadou Fofana I, Kiki Kouyaté, Sikou Niakaté, Hamari Traoré, Amadou Danté, Falaye Sacko, Moussa Diarra, Lassana Coulibaly, Adama Traoré, Yves Bissouma, Amadou Haidara, Aliou Dieng, Diadié Samassékou, Kamory Doumbia, Boubacar Traoré, Mohamed Camara, Moussa Doumbia, Sékou Koïta, Fousseni Diabaté, Ibrahim Sissoko, Lassine Sinayoko, Siriné Doucouré, Youssoufou Niakaté, Nene Dorgeles.\\xa0 Coach: Éric Chelle\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Can Mauricio Pochettino’s men turn it around? We look ahead to this EFL Cup semi-final second leg with our Chelsea vs Middlesbrough prediction and preview. Few people will have expected Middlesbrough to beat Chelsea in the first leg at the Riverside Stadium two weeks ago. Our supercomputer gave them just a 19.5% chance prevailing, but they did just that thanks to Hayden Hackney’s first-half goal. The Premier League side weren’t without their chances though, attempting three times as many shots as their hosts yet failing to score despite an expected goals total (xG) of 2.6. Hackney’s winner sent the home crowd into jubilation in the first leg. Find the net again at Stamford Bridge and the England U21 international will become only the second player to score in both legs of a League Cup semi-final tie for Middlesbrough after Paul Merson in 1997-98 against Liverpool. Chelsea still have the second leg to turn things around, and will fancy their chances of doing so. The Blues have made it to the final on two of the last three occasions they’ve lost the first leg of an EFL Cup semi-final tie, and on both occasions the second leg was at Stamford Bridge. But Middlesbrough are no strangers to success at this stage. They’ve progressed from their last three EFL Cup semi-final ties, most recently against Arsenal in 2003-04 en route to winning the trophy. They have, however, been eliminated from the competition both times their semi-final second leg was away from home, despite avoiding defeat in the first leg each time (against Manchester City in 1975-76 and Manchester United in 1991-92). Michael Carrick’s men are looking to become the first side from a lower division to eliminate Premier League opposition at the EFL Cup semi-final stage since Bradford City in 2012-13 (against Aston Villa). Meanwhile, the last top-flight side to lose both legs of a semi-final tie against a lower-tiered side were Chelsea (against Sheffield Wednesday in 1990-91). Unsurprisingly, Chelsea generally do well at home to lower-league opposition in this competition. They have won 15 of their last 16 League Cup home games against sides from a lower division (D1), with their last such defeat coming in October 1999 against Huddersfield Town (1-0). The Blues have scored 53 goals across these 16 games at an average of 3.3 per game. Middlesbrough have had a great run to this point, winning all six of their EFL Cup games this season. Only two teams have won more in a row while consistently outside the top-flight – Bristol City’s eight between 1987 and 1989, and QPR’s nine between 1966 and 1967. It’s anyone’s guess as to who the hero could be for the home side. All six of Chelsea’s EFL Cup goals this season have been scored by different players. They last had more different goalscorers in a single campaign (excluding own goals) in 2017-18 (7). It won’t be Christopher Nkunku, though, who was ruled out by Pochettino on Monday. Chelsea also continue to be without Reece James, Malo Gusto, Robert Sánchez, Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella, Lesley Ugochukwu and Roméo Lavia. Middlesbrough will also be missing some key players, including Emmanuel Latte Lath after he was taken off injured early in the first leg. Isaiah Jones also went off injured at the weekend but hasn’t yet been ruled out of Tuesday’s clash, while Luke Ayling, Sam Greenwood and Finn Azaz are all cup-tied. Middlesbrough may have won their most recent meeting at the Riverside Stadium, but Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 21 home games against them in all competitions (W15 D6), dating back to a 2-1 loss in the top flight in March 1975.  Chelsea have kept a clean sheet in their last nine against Middlesbrough at home, with Alen Boksic the last Boro player to score at Stamford Bridge in September 2001. Middlesbrough followed up their 1-0 win in the first leg against Chelsea with a 3-1 victory at Millwall in the Championship, thanks to goals from Lukas Engel, Jones and Marcus Forss. They only drew 1-1 at home to bottom-placed Rotherham United on Saturday, though, with a late equaliser from Forss sparing their blushes.  Chelsea have played just one game since the first leg, beating Fulham 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League thanks to a penalty from Cole Palmer before their winter break.  The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides. Chelsea will need to win to give themselves any chance of advancing to the EFL Cup final, and the Opta supercomputer believes they will, giving Pochettino’s side a 71.3% chance of victory in 90 minutes.  Any other result after 90 minutes would be enough for Middlesbrough to dump their illustrious opponents out, and they achieve a draw or a win in 28.7% of pre-match simulations. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to the game with our Angola vs Burkina Faso prediction and preview. Few would have predicted Group D to look like this heading into Matchday 3 at AFCON 2023, with Angola and Burkina Faso facing off in first and second in the standings in what is essentially a play-off for top spot. Both sides have beaten Mauritania and drawn with Algeria, leaving them tied on four points with Algeria two points back. It means the winner of this game will finish first, but a draw would open the door to the Fennec Foxes jumping above both of them with a two-goal victory over Mauritania. Angola and Burkina Faso will both have good reason to go for the win here, then.  Burkina Faso have scored at least once in each of their last 16 AFCON matches and netted two or more in two of their last three games in the competition. They have also lost only two of their last 15 matches at the Africa Cup of Nations, so there’s plenty of cause for optimism. However, Angola will be full of confidence, too, having put three past Mauritania last time out. In doing so, they ended a nine-match winless streak (D5 L4) at the Africa Cup of Nations, a run stretching all the way back to January 2012. They dominated the stats that day and deserved their win. These two sides will be delighted at the position they find themselves in, but it will be interesting to see how they deal with the pressure of needing to win to guarantee qualification as group winners. It may be that it gets to them, or they may both play with freedom, knowing they’ve nothing to lose. With four points apiece already, they are likely to qualify for the knockout round as one of the best third-placed teams even if they lose this game. That, of course, will mean a tougher opponent in the next round, though, so there is plenty to play for. This will be the second ever meeting between these teams at the Africa Cup of Nations; their first, in the group stage at the 2012 tournament, ended in a 2-1 win for Angola. On that occasion, Angola finished third in the group and Burkina Faso finished fourth. Things have changed dramatically for both teams. They have also faced each other more recently, in qualifying for the 2019 AFCON in November 2018. That game also ended in a 2-1 win for Angola. The Opta supercomputer makes Burkina Faso the favourites for this contest, giving them a 43.4% chance of taking all three points. Angola are given a 23.8% chance of causing an upset, while the draw is slightly less likely at 22.8%.  In our pre-tournament predictions, these two sides were deemed far less likely than Algeria to top Group D, but both have a huge chance to win the group now. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Angola: Neblú, Kadú, Gelson, António Signori, Eddie, Jonathan Buatu, Inácio Miguel, Tó Carneiro, Kialonda Gaspar, Kinito, Núrio Fortuna, Fredy, Bruno Paz, Manuel Keliano, Beni, Show, Estrela, Gelson Dala, Mabululu, Milson, Depú, Loide Augusto, Gilberto, Chico Banza, Jérémie Bela, Zine, Zito Luvumbo.\\xa0 Coach: Pedro Gonçalves Burkina Faso: Hervé Koffi, Hillel Konaté, Kilian Nikièma, Sébastien Tou, Edmond Tapsoba, Steeve Yago, Issoufou Dayo, Valentin Nouma, Abdoul Guiébré, Adamo Nagalo, Nasser Djiga, Issa Kaboré, Blati Touré, Bertrand Traoré, Gustavo Sangaré, Sacha Bansé, Mamady Bangré, Cédric Badolo, Ismahila Ouédraogo, Dramane Salou, Adama Guira, Djibril Ouattara, Mohamed Konaté, Abdoul Tapsoba, Aziz Ki, Hassane Bandé, Dango Ouattara.\\xa0 Coach: Hubert Velud\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Having made a hugely disappointing start to AFCON 2023, Algeria’s hopes of progressing to the knockout stage rest on them securing a positive result in their final game. Fortunately for the North Africans, on MD 3 they face what should be their easiest match so far at the tournament. Two draws from two – against Angola (1-1) and Burkina Faso (2-2) – leave Algeria, who were fourth favourites to win the whole competition in our pre-tournament predictions, third in Group D and probably in need of a victory in their third and final match. Up against a Mauritania side who have never won a game at the Africa Cup of Nations (two draws and six losses in eight games), they have the perfect chance to get their campaign back on track. After stumbling against Angola in their opening match, Algeria needed a 95th-minute Baghdad Bounedjah equaliser to rescue a point against Burkina Faso. Bounedjah has scored all three of Algeria’s goal at AFCON 2023 (3), meaning he is now two goals away from setting a new record for the most goals scored by an Algerian at any edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. Algeria have won four of their five meetings with Mauritania, so this should be a decent opportunity to put their own poor recent AFCON record to an end; they are without a win in five successive Africa Cup of Nations games for the first time since 2013. However, Mauritania can’t be completely written off, simply because they managed a draw with Algeria in their most recent meeting – an international friendly in December 2022. They also showed noteworthy improvement in their last match – a 3-2 defeat to Angola. In that game, Mauritania scored more goals than in any of their other previous AFCON matches and also took their total of shots on target at the tournament to eight – more than they managed in the whole of AFCON 2021 (six). They will take confidence from that game into this one. Algeria are historically the bigger and more successful footballing nation, so it is no real surprise that they have the better of the teams’ head-to-head record. With four wins and a draw from five meetings, Algeria have dominated matches between these sides. This will, however, be their first meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations. Also, having earned a goalless draw in their most recent meeting with Algeria, Mauritania will hope they can get another positive result here.  Given the two sides’ relative strengths, it comes as no surprise that the Opta supercomputer makes Algeria strong favourites for this game. It predicts they take all three points in 70.7% of simulations. Mauritania have a slim 9.4% chance of causing a massive upset, while the draw comes in at 19.9%.  Our pre-tournament predictions had Algeria as fourth favourites, giving them a 9.7% chance of winning AFCON glory. That chance has now dropped, albeit not by a lot, with the Fennec Foxes handed a 7.3% shot at winning the title as of writing.  Given the strength of Mauritania, Algeria still have a very solid chance of qualifying for the last 16, doing so in 78.7% of tournament simulations at the time of writing.  Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Mauritania: Namori Diaw, M’Backé N’Diaye, Babacar Niasse, Aly Abeid, Mohamed Dellahi, Lamine Ba, Khadim Diaw, Ibrahima Keita, Hassan Houbeib, Bakary N’Diaye, Nouh El Abd, Mouhsine Bodda, Sidi El Abd, Oumar Ngom, Omaré Gassama, Abdallahi Mahmoud, El Ba, Bakari Camara, Guessouma Fofana, Pape Bâ, Aboubakary Koïta, Sidi Amar, Souleymane Doukara, Hemeya Tanjy, Aboubakar Kamara, Souleymane Anne, Idrissa Thiam.

Brighton and Wolves will both be hoping to boost their hopes of European football next season as the pair meet at the Amex Stadium on Monday to complete the Premier League’s Matchday 21 fixture list. Gary O’Neil’s Wolves are unbeaten in five across all competitions, beating Chelsea, Brentford and Everton in the Premier League before winning their FA Cup third-round replay with Thomas Frank’s Bees on Tuesday after a 1-1 draw in the first meeting. A 3-2 victory over Brentford at Molineux teed up a Black Country derby with West Bromwich Albion next Sunday in the FA Cup fourth round after Matheus Cunha’s 110th-minute penalty proved the difference in an extra-time win over Frank’s visitors. Cunha has been in fine form in Premier League action, too, after being involved in eight goals across his last nine top-flight appearances for Wolves (four goals, four assists), having registered just five goal contributions in his first 28 games for the club in the competition (four goals, one assist). Brazilian forward Cunha will be expected to continue to step up in the absence of Hwang Hee-chan at the Asian Cup, with the South Korea international directly involved in 43.3% of Wolves’ 30 Premier League goals this term (10 goals, three assists), with only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (51.2%) and Bournemouth’s Dominic Solanke (46.4%) either scoring or assisting a higher share of their side’s goals. O’Neil’s men are 11th in the league table but trail eighth-placed Brighton by just three points heading into the second weekend of MD 21 fixtures, though the Wolves manager will be without key midfielder João Gomes due to suspension. Algeria’s Rayan Aït-Nouri and Mali’s Boubacar Traoré are also away on Africa Cup of Nations duty. While Wolves may harbour faint hopes of an unlikely UEFA Europa Conference League qualification with a push in the second half of the season, Brighton – already in the UEFA Europa League knockout stage this term – will fancy their chances further as they trail Arsenal and Tottenham in fourth and fifth respectively by nine points, sixth-placed West Ham United by three and Manchester United by one. The Seagulls are unbeaten in their last three league games, defeating Spurs 4-2 either side of draws with Crystal Palace and West Ham, and progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 4-2 victory over Stoke City after goals from defenders Pervis Estupiñán and Lewis Dunk as well as a João Pedro brace in their last outing. João Pedro continues to be the reliant figure from 12 yards, too, scoring all eight of Brighton’s penalties in all competitions this season, meaning 53% of his goals have come from the spot (8/15). The Brazilian has also scored more penalty goals than any other Premier League player across all competitions this campaign. Despite impressive returns in recent weeks, the team news is getting no better for De Zerbi. He continues to be without the injured Solly March, Simon Adingra, Kaoru Mitoma, Ansu Fati, Tariq Lamptey, Julio Enciso and Joël Veltman, though Igor Julio could return for Monday’s late kick-off.  Those injury issues mean De Zerbi will likely utilise Facundo Buonanotte, who against West Ham became the youngest player to create as many as four chances in a Premier League match since Callum Hudson-Odoi for Chelsea against Newcastle United in October 2019 (18y 346d). At the other end of the spectrum, James Milner made his 632nd Premier League appearance in Brighton’s last outing, moving level with Ryan Giggs in second for most games in the competition, with only Gareth Barry playing more (653). Wolves’ head-to-head record against Brighton is woeful, losing their last four Premier League games and conceding three goals in each (16 in total) after Mitoma and Estupiñán scored before a March brace in a 4-1 away win in the reverse fixture this term. Hwang scored a consolation for the hosts before Matheus Nunes was sent off in stoppage time. Only twice before have Wolves lost 5+ consecutive league games against an opponent and shipped 3+ goals each time – eight against Manchester City (1902-1909) and five against Blackpool (1927-1929) – while Brighton’s last four league wins in this fixture are as many as they had in their previous 19 combined (D10 L5). Brighton manager De Zerbi has also won all three of his Premier League meetings with Wolves by an aggregate scoreline of 13-3, a stark contrast to O’Neil who has lost all three of his Premier League encounters against the Seagulls, with his sides (also including Bournemouth) conceding seven goals and scoring one in reply. The visitors will need to watch out for Danny Welbeck on Monday as the Brighton striker has six goal involvements in eight Premier League starts against Wolves (four goals, two assists) and was one of three players to net a brace in this exact fixture last season as the south-coast club ran out 6-0 winners (also two goals for Pascal Groß and Deniz Undav). While their woeful record against Brighton may be of concern, Wolves have won each of their last three Premier League games – against Everton, Brentford and Chelsea – though they have not recorded four successive top-flight triumphs since January 1972 under Bill McGarry. O’Neil’s side are enjoying a much-needed winning streak but, owing to MD 21 scheduling and FA Cup commitments, could be caught cold given they have not played a league game since 30 December. This will be Wolves’ first top flight game of 2024, which marks the third latest a team has played their first Premier League game of a calendar year (excluding promoted sides), after Portsmouth in 2010 (January 26) and Manchester United in 2000 (January 24). Meanwhile, Brighton drew 0-0 with West Ham in their last Premier League match, keeping their first clean sheet in the competition this season at the 20th time of asking. De Zerbi’s men last kept consecutive league shutouts in April/May 2023, one of which was the 6-0 home win over Wolves. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world.

For a quick primer on how they’re calculated,\\xa0you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Pascal Groß: 80.5 (out of 100)Billy Gilmour: 75.8Evan Ferguson: 72.9Jan Paul van Hecke: 72.7João Pedro: 68.2 Hwang Hee-chan: 71.1 (out of 100)Max Kilman: 70.8Matheus Cunha: 70.1Craig Dawson: 69.6Toti: 69.5 Taking into consideration their favourable head-to-head record, Brighton are backed by the Opta supercomputer in 46.6% of simulations to defeat Wolves, who are ranked at 24.8% to triumph at the Amex. A draw would extend unbeaten runs for both sides, with that result coming in in 28.6% of 10,000 data-led predictions, though neither manager will set up for just a point. In the end-of-season Opta predictions, Brighton finish seventh most often, doing so in 22.2% of simulations – one above their current league position – while Wolves are expected to remain in their position of 11th in 19.6% of data-predicted scenarios.

We look ahead to this game with our Guinea vs Senegal prediction and preview. Senegal’s defence of their AFCON title could barely have started better. The Teranga Lions followed up a 3-0 win over Gambia on Matchday 1 with a 3-1 victory against Cameroon on Friday. Those two wins have sent Aliou Cissé’s side through with a game to spare, though they will need to avoid defeat against Guinea on MD 3 at Stade Charles Konan Banny to confirm their place at the top of Group C. Ismaïla Sarr gave Senegal an early lead against Cameroon, before Habib Diallo added a second from a Sarr cross. Jean-Charles\\xa0Castelletto thundered in a header to halve the deficit, but Sadio Mané put the game to bed deep into stoppage time with an accurate finish past André Onana. Guinea are handily placed to join Senegal in the last 16 but will want to avoid the uncertainty of finishing third, with only four of the six third-placed teams going through. Kaba Diawara’s men were made to work for their win over Gambia but finally found a way through when Aguibou Camara scored with just over 20 minutes remaining in their MD 2 clash. They prevented Gambia from having a single shot on target, but could only find the net once themselves despite having 16 shots and an expected goals total of 2.21. This will be the fourth AFCON meeting between Guinea and Senegal. Only Ghana have faced Guinea on more occasions (6) at the tournament. Senegal have not lost to Guinea in three meetings at the Africa Cup of Nations, with two wins and one draw: 2-1 in 1994 (group stage), 3-2 in 2006 (quarter-final) and 0-0 in 2022 (group stage). Guinea did score the opening goal in each of their two defeats, though. Senegal need just a point to secure top spot in Group C but will surely want to make it three wins from three as they seek to successfully defend their AFCON crown. The Opta supercomputer makes them favourites to beat Guinea, with a 39.9% chance of doing so. The draw still suits them, which has a 35.1% likelihood, while the Syli National have a 25.0% chance of winning and taking first place from them.  In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Senegal as favourites to lift the trophy, though they recently slipped behind Morocco into second place. Take a look at our live predictor and plenty more AFCON 2023 stats. Guinea will feel confident of advancing with a 98.0% chance of progressing (at the time of writing), so says the supercomputer. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Guinea: Ibrahim Koné, Aly Keita, Moussa Camara, Mohamed Ali Camara, Sekou Sylla, Julian Jeanvier, Saïdou Sow, Mouctar Diakhaby, Antoine Conté, Issiaga Sylla, Ibrahim Diakité, Seydouba Cissé, Amadou Diawara, Naby Keïta, Mory Konaté, Ilaix Moriba, Abdoulaye Touré, Aguibou Camara, Mohamed Bayo, José Kanté, Serhou Guirassy, Morgan Guilavogui, Facinet Conté, Karim Cissé, François Kamano.\\xa0 Coach: Kaba Diawara Senegal:\\xa0Mory Diaw, Seny Dieng, Édouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Youssouf Sabaly, Ismail Jakobs, Formose Mendy, Abdoulaye N’Diaye, Abdou Diallo, Fodé Ballo-Touré, Abdoulaye Seck, Moussa Niakhaté, Krépin Diatta, Idrissa Gueye, Pathé Ciss, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Nampalys Mendy, Lamine Camara, Pape Gueye, Pape Sarr, Sadio Mané, Habib Diallo, Nicolas Jackson, Boulaye Dia, Ismaïla Sarr, Iliman Ndiaye, Abdallah Sima.

We look ahead to Tuesday’s game with our Gambia vs Cameroon prediction and preview. Cameroon have one more chance to rescue their AFCON 2023 campaign, and will almost certainly need to beat Gambia at Stade de Bouaké on Matchday 3 to have a chance of advancing to the round of 16. The 2017 AFCON champions have just one point from their first two games in Group C, having drawn with Guinea before losing to Senegal. Fail to win here and they will probably be out of the tournament. It would be quite a blow for goalkeeper André Onana, who only recently arrived in Ivory Coast. He missed Cameroon’s opener against Guinea due to commitments with Manchester United, and could be back in England without having missed a game for his club unless the Indomitable Lions can get through. Rigobert Song’s men were well beaten 3-1 by Senegal on MD 2, despite Jean-Charles\\xa0Castelletto pulling a late goal back. At the time it reduced the deficit to 2-1 as Cameroon looked to fight back, but Sadio Mané put the game to bed deep into stoppage time. Their opponents are in an even more desperate situation, with Gambia pointless after two games having lost to Senegal and Guinea. They will need to win here and hope results elsewhere see them go through as one of the four best third-place teams. Gambia looked for a while like they might be able to take a point from their game with Guinea on MD 2, but ultimately fell to a goal from Aguibou Camara scored with just over 20 minutes remaining. Tom Saintfiet’s side were unable to record a shot on target, ending the game with an expected goals total of just 0.37. This will be just the second AFCON meeting between Gambia and Cameroon after facing off in the quarter-finals two years ago. Cameroon won that clash 2-0 thanks to two goals from Karl Toko-Ekambi. Gambia have lost all three of their previous matches against Cameroon in all competitions, failing to score a single goal and conceding five. Cameroon may be without a win so far, but the Opta supercomputer thinks they’ll make it third time lucky here. The Indomitable Lions have a 58.5% chance of victory, while Gambia are handed just a 14.5% probability of taking the three points. The draw, which would help neither team, is rated at 27.0%. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had six teams above Cameroon in terms of likelihood of winning the trophy. Their single point from their first two games has hindered their chances further, with just a 4.7% chance of winning AFCON 2023 as of writing. They do have a greater than 60% chance of making it to the last 16, though. Take a look at our live predictor and plenty more AFCON 2023 stats here. Gambia’s prospects are significantly slimmer, with a less than 10% chance of making it to the knockout stage. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Gambia: Modou Jobe, Lamin Sarr, Baboucarr Gaye, Ibou Touray, Omar Colley, Bubacarr Sanneh, Saidy Janko, James Gomez, Noah Sonko Sundberg, Jacob Mendy, Muhammed Sanneh, Sulayman Marreh, Ablie Jallow, Dawda Ngum, Alasana Manneh, Yusupha Bobb, Hamza Barry, Ebou Adams, Ebrima Darboe, Assan Ceesay, Muhammed Badamosi, Abdoulie Sanyang, Musa Barrow, Ebrima Colley, Yankuba Minteh, Alieu Fadera, Ali Sowe.

Look ahead to the game with our Cape Verde vs Egypt prediction and preview. Egypt were among the pre-tournament favourites for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, but they head into Matchday 3 of Group B with work to do against the section’s surprise winners, Cape Verde.  Bubista’s Cape Verde have enjoyed an unblemished start to their campaign, securing their place in the next round as group winners on Friday with a comfortable 3-0 win over Mozambique. It is the third time they’ve advanced from the group stage (also 2013 and 2021) but is the first time they’ve progressed in first place. Facing the record seven-time champions promises to be an entirely different matter, however, especially with Rui Vitória’s side still hoping to confirm their spot in the next round. The Pharaohs will consider themselves to have been fairly unfortunate not to have come away from their draw against Ghana with more. Although they had to come back from a goal behind twice, they had the better of proceedings and would’ve been good value for victory were it not for Mohammed Kudus’ brace. Compounding Egypt’s misfortune was the fact that talisman and captain Mohamed Salah had to be withdrawn due to a back muscle injury. The Egyptian FA have since confirmed that Salah will miss this game, as well as their last 16 clash should they advance. The Liverpool man will be missed, having been directly involved in 61% of Egypt’s goals at the Africa Cup of Nations since 2017 (11/18), scoring seven and assisting four. Nevertheless, with the likes of Omar Marmoush and Mostafa Mohamed, both of whom scored against the Black Stars, Egypt will fancy themselves to have enough against a Cape Verde side who already know they cannot be knocked off top spot. Mohamed has scored in each of the first two games at AFCON 2023 and could become the first Egyptian to score in their opening three matches at an AFCON since Hossam Hassan in 2000 (three).\\xa0 Egypt will hope Cape Verde’s secure position breeds a little complacency. This will be the first ever AFCON meeting between Cape Verde and Egypt – in fact, they’ve never met in any official competition before, with Cape Verde only becoming an independent nation in 1975. Cape Verde have faced two other North African sides in the AFCON, however. They held Morocco and Tunisia to 1-1 draws in the 2013 and 2015 editions respectively. The Opta supercomputer considers Egypt to be strong favourites for this one. The Pharaohs won 62.5% of the 10,000 pre-match predictions; Cape Verde got a third consecutive win just 14.8% of the time. In our pre-tournament predictions, the supercomputer rated Egypt as the fifth-most likely to win the title after Senegal, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Algeria, going all the way in 8.5% of simulations. Given they’re winless after two matches, it’s not a huge surprise to see their probability decrease, and if Salah’s injury rules him out for a couple of games, expect many to write them off completely. Group B winners Cape Verde were among the teams least fancied by the supercomputer before the tournament began (0.9%), but they’ve enjoyed a nice boost to that after impressing over the first two matchdays. Another win on Monday could be a real statement.  Below you’ll find the latest, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Cape Verde: Márcio da Rosa, Vózinha, Dylan Silva, Stopira, Dylan Tavares, João Correia, Logan Costa, Steven Moreira, Pico, Diney Borges, Kenny Rocha, Laros Duarte, Deroy Duarte, Kevin Pina, Cuca, Patrick Andrade, Jamiro Monteiro, João Paulo, Ryan Mendes, Willy Semedo, Garry Rodrigues, Jovane Cabral, Bebé, Bryan Teixeira, Hélio Varela, Gilson Benchimol. Coach: Bubista Egypt: Mohamed Abou Gabal, Mohamed Sobhi, Mohamed El Shenawy, Ahmed El Shenawy, Ahmed Samy, Ali Gabr, Mohamed Hany, Mohamed Hamdy, Yasser Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdelmonem, Omar Kamal, Ahmed Abou El Fotouh, Ahmed Hegazy, Trézéguet, Mohamed Elneny, Marwan Attia, Mahmoud Hamada, Hamdi Fathy, Emam Ashour, Mohanad Lasheen, Zizo, Mohamed Salah, Koka, Mostafa Fathi, Kahraba, Mostafa Mohamed, Omar Marmoush.

Look ahead to their tussle with our Mozambique vs Ghana prediction and preview. A thrilling finale promises to grip Africa Cup of Nations Group B on Monday with three teams still aiming to qualify for the knockout stages; two of them go head-to-head when Mozambique and Ghana tussle in what is essentially a winner-takes-all encounter. With one point apiece after two matches, Ghana and Mozambique both need to win to stand any real chance of qualifying for the last 16. It may not have been a vintage performance from Ghana last time out against Egypt, with the Black Stars arguably lucky to earn a point despite leading twice, but the draw gives them a much greater chance of getting through to the knockouts with a total of four points likely to be enough to at least take one of the best third-place spots. Considering Mohammed Kudus got his campaign off to an emphatic start on MD 2 with a couple of goals, Chris Hughton will be confident his team have the requisite quality to see off a Mozambique team also battling to save themselves. Kudus has had the most shots (4), most shots on target (2), the best pass accuracy among teammates to complete at least 20 passes (91.3%) and completed three times as many dribbles (6) as any teammate so far at the tournament.\\xa0 Their commendable MD 1 draw with Egypt meant confidence in the Mozambique camp was high heading into their second game, but Cape Verde brought them crashing back to earth as the Islanders won 3-0 on Friday. They didn’t exactly help themselves, though, with goalkeeper Ernan culpable for Cape Verde’s first goal and the second coming as a result of a defensive error by centre-back Edmilson Dove.  As such, anything other than a win will almost certainly see the Mambas heading home as they sit behind Ghana at the bottom of the table on goal difference, which would be the tiebreaker if head-to-head record with the Black Stars is level. They could finish third with a draw if Egypt are hammered by Cape Verde, but that seems unlikely, as does the possibility of Mozambique being one of the best third-placed teams with just two points. A Mozambique win would be a first, as they remain winless at the Africa Cup of Nations (P14 D3 L11), the joint most any nation has played without a victory at AFCON, along with Benin. Mozambique and Ghana faced each other in the group stage of the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations, with Ghana emerging 2-0 victors; that’s their only past meeting at the AFCON. They’ve met each other six times in all official competitions, though, with Ghana winning four and losing none. The Opta supercomputer is backing Ghana to prevail in this MD 3 clash, with the Black Stars winning 56.6% of the 10,000 pre-match predictions. Mozambique claimed a crucial victory in just 16.4% of scenarios. In our pre-tournament predictions, the supercomputer only rated Ghana as the ninth favourites to go all the way, doing so in just 5.3% of simulations. Unsurprisingly, given they’ve not won either of their first two games, their chances have decreased even further since. Mozambique’s probability of winning the trophy hasn’t changed dramatically, but that’s mostly down to the fact they were only given a 0.6% likelihood in the first place. Below you’ll find the latest, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Mozambique: Ivan Urrubal, Ernan, Fazito, Reinildo, David Malembana, Domingos Macandza, Bruno Langa, Mexer, Nanani, Edmilson Dove, Amadou, Clésio, Guima, Alfons Amade, Dominguês, Shaquille, João Bonde, Nené, Gildo Lourenço, Stanley Ratifo, Geny Catamo, Witi, Lau King.

Here, we look ahead to one of them with our Guinea-Bissau vs Nigeria prediction and preview. Group A of AFCON 2023 reaches its climax on Monday as Guinea-Bissau play Nigeria at the same time as Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast do battle. With only one point separating the top three teams – Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Ivory Coast – and the potential for all three of them to qualify for the knockout stages, it’s all to play for here.  Bottom-placed Guinea-Bissau, meanwhile, are already out of the tournament, having lost both of their first two games. Even a win wouldn’t allow them to overturn the three-point deficit to third-placed Ivory Coast, who beat Guinea-Bissau 2-0 on Matchday 1 and therefore will remain above them in the standings with a superior head-to-head record. Nigeria earned a narrow but crucial victory over Ivory Coast in their last game, soaking up pressure with only a 36% share of possession and facing 14 shots. However, those attempts only generated 0.57 xG, with Nigeria largely keeping their opponents at arm’s length and then punishing them at the other end thanks to William Troost-Ekong’s penalty, which did boost their own xG total. A point for Nigeria would guarantee their passage into the knockouts, though with the four best third-placed teams from the six groups at AFCON 2023 also qualifying, the four points the Super Eagles have already accrued might be enough to see them through. They will be confident of winning this one, though, up against a Guinea-Bissau team who have conceded six goals in two defeats at AFCON 2023. They have also never in their history won an AFCON game, losing eight and drawing three. They have lost their last four in a row, but they have never before lost all three of their group stage games, so defeat would secure an unwanted first for them on that front. Nigeria will be hoping to celebrate their 100th AFCON game in this match with a win, becoming the fourth nation to reach that tally. Of the previous three, only one has won their 100th match, though that was Ivory Coast earlier on in this year’s tournament – against Guinea-Bissau. With stars such as Victor Osimhen, Alex Iwobi, Ademola Lookman and Kelechi Iheanacho to call upon, it’s hard to imagine anything other than a Nigeria win. This will be Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria’s second-ever meeting at AFCON, their first coming in the group stage at the last edition of the tournament. On that occasion, Nigeria ran out 2-0 victors on their way to a perfect record in Group D. They were also in the same group for qualification for this tournament, though, so have played one another twice since the last AFCON. Both of those games ended in 1-0 away wins, so Guinea-Bissau do have some hope to cling to. According to the Opta supercomputer, Nigeria are firm favourites to win this game and take a big step towards wrapping up top spot in Group A. They were victorious in 61.2% of the supercomputer’s pre-match simulations, while Guinea-Bissau won just 18.2%. That leaves the likelihood of the draw at 20.6%. Nigeria are deemed most likely to top the group ahead of Equatorial Guinea, with whom they drew on MD 1, and currently trail in the group standings on goal difference. However, they face the easier final game on paper, playing a Guinea-Bissau side who have nothing but pride to play for. Below are both teams’ current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Guinea-Bissau:\\xa0Ouparine Djoco, Jonas Mendes, Fernando Embadje, Sori Mané, Marcelo Djaló, Fali Candé, Jefferson Encada, Edgar Ié, Opa Sanganté, Nanu, Prosper Mendy, Houboulang Mendes, Nito Gomes, Dálcio, Zidane Banjaqui, Janio Bikel, Moreto Cassamá, Mauro Rodrigues, Alfa Semedo, Famana Quizera, Carlos Mané, Mama Baldé, Marciano Sanca, Zé Turbo, Carlos Gomes, Zinho Gano, Franculino Djú.

The hosts of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations are hoping to cement their place in the knockout stage, but Ivory Coast still have work to do when they face Equatorial Guinea at Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara on Monday.  Their 1-0 defeat to Nigeria on Matchday 2 was a blow, but thanks to their opening win over Guinea-Bissau, they are still well placed to go through considering four of the six third-place teams in the tournament will advance. It bodes well for the Elephants though that they have not lost consecutive AFCON games since February 2008 (vs Egypt and Ghana in the semi-finals and third-place play-off respectively). They also haven’t lost two games in an AFCON group stage since 2002. Jean-Louis Gasset’s men were disappointing against Nigeria, though, having more shots (14-11) but recording a much lower expected goals total (0.57-1.72). William Troost-Ekong’s winning penalty did aid that number for the Super Eagles. Ivory Coast will not want to match their own unwanted record. Their loss to Nigeria was the first time a host nation has lost a group stage match at the Africa Cup of Nations since 2012, when Monday’s opponents Equatorial Guinea lost 1-0 to Zambia. Only one host nation has ever lost two AFCON group games, and that was Ivory Coast back in 1984. They will once again look to Jérémie Boga for inspiration. The Nice winger is either top or joint-top for chances created (4), expected assists (0.28), passes played into the box (10), dribbles attempted (5) and successful crosses (4) among his Ivory Coast teammates. Equatorial Guinea come into their final Group A game on a high after beating Guinea-Bissau. The 4-2 success came largely thanks to a hat-trick from former Middlesbrough and Birmingham City player Emilio Nsue. In doing so, he became the oldest player to score a hat-trick at AFCON (34 years, 110 days) and the first to do so at any edition for 15 years and 362 days since Soufiane Alloudi in 2008 for Morocco against Namibia. The National Thunder top the group on four points heading into MD 3, and generally do well in the Africa Cup of Nations group stage. Equatorial Guinea have only lost two of their 11 AFCON group stage matches (W6 D3). However, one of those was against Ivory Coast in the 2022 edition. This will be the third meeting between Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations. Equatorial Guinea will have faced Ivory Coast more times than any other opponent at the tournament, with the latter having won both previous encounters: 3-0 in 2012 (quarter-finals) and 1-0 in 2022 (group stage). They are in the same group for the second consecutive AFCON. In 2022, they finished second and first respectively, with – as mentioned – Ivory Coast winning their meeting 1-0. Their only other clash was a 1-1 draw in a friendly in March 2015. A win will guarantee Ivory Coast a top-two place in Group A, and the Opta supercomputer is backing them to get it. The tournament hosts are given a 58.2% chance of victory, while Equatorial Guinea have just a 20.2% likelihood of recording their second win of AFCON 2023. The draw is rated at 21.6%. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Ivory Coast as second favourites to lift the trophy. Their chances have actually risen slightly since, despite their defeat to Nigeria.  With four points from their first two games, Equatorial Guinea have a near-certain chance of reaching the last 16 according to the supercomputer. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Equatorial Guinea: Aitor Embela, Manuel Sapunga, Jesús Owono, Saúl Coco, Basilio Ndong, Carlos Akapo, Esteban Orozco, Néstor Senra, Marvin Anieboh, Emilio Nsue, José Elo, Charles Ondo, Féderico Bikoro, José Machín, Santiago Eneme, Pablo Ganet, Álex Balboa, Jannick Buyla, Iban Salvador, José Miranda, Óscar Siafá, José Nabil, Salomón Obama, Noé Ela, Luís Asué.\\xa0 Coach: Juan Michá Ivory Coast:\\xa0Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté.\\xa0 Coach: Jean-Louis Gasset Enjoy this?

Liverpool will be looking to consolidate their place at the Premier League summit when they visit the Vitality Stadium to face Andoni Iraola’s in-form Bournemouth on Sunday, with the Reds returning to top-flight action after two positive cup results to start 2024. Jürgen Klopp’s side sit three points clear of Manchester City and Aston Villa in the league – who both played last weekend in a split Matchday 21 – and five ahead of fourth-placed Arsenal, who have fallen down the league table after a woeful Christmas period. Liverpool were 4-2 winners at home in their last Premier League outing against Newcastle United, with Mohamed Salah scoring twice – as well as missing a spot-kick – along with goals from Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo on New Year’s Day. Backing up their fine league form, Liverpool dealt a psychological blow to Arsenal with a 2-0 victory in their FA Cup third-round clash at the Emirates Stadium. They made it three straight wins across all competitions to start the new year as they battled from a goal down to beat Fulham 2-1 after second-half strikes from Jones and Gakpo in their EFL Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield. Competing in all three domestic competitions, as well as the UEFA Europa League knockout stage, the Reds are yet to relent on any front but Klopp will face some unwanted considerations for his lineup on Sunday. The Bournemouth trip will be Liverpool’s first Premier League game without Salah, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt, since a 2-1 win at Southampton in May 2022. However, since Salah joined the Reds in 2017-18, Liverpool have lost none of their 10 Premier League games without him (W7 D3), winning each of the last four in a row. Klopp’s mood will not have been helped by seeing Salah limp off in Egypt’s 2-2 draw with Ghana on Thursday with an apparent hamstring issue. Darwin Núñez could step up in Salah’s absence, with the former Benfica striker averaging a goal or assist every 93 minutes in all competitions for Klopp’s men this season (8 goals, 10 assists in 1,667 minutes), with only Salah having a better average for Liverpool this term (one every 79). Núñez’s next goal will also be the 100th of his senior career for club and country. Trent Alexander-Arnold will also not be available due to a knee injury, while Andy Robertson, Kostas Tsimikas, Dominik Szoboszlai, Stefan Bajcetić, Thiago Alcântara and Joël Matip are still out injured. Wataru Endo is away at the Asian Cup with Japan. After speculation over Iraola’s future at Bournemouth, the former Rayo Vallecano head coach has turned his new side’s fortunes around. A 3-1 defeat against Spurs at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in their last league outing should only serve as a minor blemish on an otherwise impressive festive period, having triumphed in four straight league games – against Crystal Palace, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Fulham – before that. A 3-2 comeback victory against Championship side QPR in the FA Cup third round will only add momentum to the impressive Bournemouth charge after Marcus Tavernier, Kieffer Moore and Justin Kluivert inspired a noteworthy second-half turnaround at Loftus Road. The south-coast club sit 12th in the league table heading into this weekend’s MD 21 fixtures, some nine points clear of the relegation zone despite not winning any of their first nine games this term. That upturn in form has largely been down to the scoring form of former Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke, who has found the net in each of his last three home league games (vs Man Utd, Forest and Fulham) and could become the first player to score in four consecutive home appearances in the Premier League for Bournemouth. In team news for the hosts, Iraola also has a hefty absentee list to deal with, though, as Antoine Semenyo and Dango Ouattara are at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana and Burkina Faso respectively, while Ryan Fredericks, Lloyd Kelly, Hamed Traorè and Tyler Adams are out injured and key centre-back Marcos Senesi is suspended. Bournemouth could at least welcome back Milos Kerkez, who has recovered from an ankle injury sustained at the end of last month. Bournemouth have lost eight of their last nine league meetings with Liverpool, though the exception was a 1-0 victory in this exact fixture last season as Salah missed a penalty after Philip Billing had given the hosts the lead. Liverpool have already won at the Vitality Stadium this season, beating Bournemouth 2-1 in the EFL Cup fourth round as Gakpo and Núñez scored on a wet and windy night, with Justin Kluivert finding the net for the Cherries. The last team to beat the south-coast club twice away from home in the same season was Bristol City in 1999-00. Klopp’s side were also 3-1 victors in the reverse fixture at Anfield this term, responding to Semenyo’s surprise third-minute opener with goals from Luis Díaz, Salah and Diogo Jota, despite Alexis Mac Allister’s second-half red card. Look away Bournemouth fans… the Cherries have lost all nine of their Premier League games against teams starting the day top of the table, conceding 30 goals and scoring just six. It’s the most such games any team has played in the competition with a 100% loss record. The Premier League’s two most in-form teams will meet for this one, with Bournemouth recording more points from their last eight top-flight games than any other side (19 – W6 D1 L1), while Liverpool rank second in the same period with 18 (W5 D3). Bournemouth have won three of their last four Premier League home games (D1), against Fulham, Newcastle United and Burnley, as many as their previous 16 beforehand (D4 L9). They have scored nine goals in their last four league games at home, also including a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa, as many as in their previous 11. However, Liverpool have also won each of their last three away league games after defeating Burnley, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United, while Klopp’s men last won four in a row on the road in the competition in March 2022. They have kept two clean sheets in these three wins, as many as their previous 14 away league matches beforehand, while they also won 2-0 away at Arsenal in the FA Cup earlier this month. Klopp’s men are the comeback kings this term, too, rescuing more points from losing positions than any other side in the Premier League this season (19), with 12 of those coming away from home. They have lost just one of their last 14 league games in which they’ve trailed (W6 D7), with that defeat coming away to Tottenham in September after a 96th-minute Matip own goal. That remains their only loss in the Premier League this season.

Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Dominic Solanke: 70.4 (out of 100)Marcus Tavernier: 65.5Marcos Senesi: 62.6Neto: 61.9Lewis Cook: 60.2 Mohamed Salah: 78.2 (out of 100)Trent Alexander-Arnold: 75.8Virgil van Dijk: 75.6Alisson: 73.8Dominik Szoboszlai: 73.6 The Opta supercomputer heavily backs Liverpool for victory, with Klopp’s side winning 61.2% of 10,000 pre-match simulations compared to a Bournemouth win in just 15.6% and a draw in 23.2% of data-led scenarios. Manchester City still rank as the favourites to defend their title, though, winning the Premier League in 65% of season simulations, with Liverpool’s chances ranked at 30.7% despite being top of the league table. Meanwhile, Bournemouth finish 12th – their current league-table standing – in the most Opta predictions (20.7%), though they secure a top-10 position in 27.7% of them. Enjoy this?

Look ahead with our South Africa vs Namibia prediction and preview. It may only be Matchday 2 of the Africa Cup of Nations, but South Africa and Namibia already find themselves at a potentially pivotal moment ahead of their duel at Amadou Gon Coulibaly Stadium on Sunday due to contrasting fortunes in their respective Group E openers. South Africa lost 2-0 to Mali on MD 1, meaning more dropped points this weekend will almost certainly require them to win their final – and toughest on paper – game of the group stage against Tunisia next week if they’re to have any realistic hope of reaching the knockout phase. Namibia, on the other hand, opened their campaign with a shock 1-0 win over Tunisia, earning their first-ever victory at the Africa Cup of Nations. If they make it two from two, they’ll achieve another first by booking their spot in the next round. Collin Benjamin’s side should have nothing to fear now; the Opta supercomputer had them as rank outsiders against the Carthage Eagles on MD 1, winning just 19.2% of the pre-match simulations compared to Tunisia’s 61%, and yet they were good value for the victory. Striker Peter Shalulile alone accumulated more expected goals (xG) than Tunisia despite not even scoring; in the end, the team managed 1.76 xG to their opponents’ 0.69 as they created the better opportunities. Perhaps Namibia’s lack of fear on MD 1 can inspire South Africa; after all, their situation requires them to take the initiative. Their missed penalty aside, clear-cut chances were hard to come by against Mali but they still recorded 12 shots and saw more of the ball (54%). The omens are good considering they’ve a positive head-to-head record against Namibia at the Africa Cup of Nations and not lost their opening two games of an AFCON since 2008 – but if the Brave Warriors’ win over Tunisia showed anything, it’s that Bafana Bafana will have to earn their tournament lifeline here. With the four best third-place teams also going through to the last 16, defeat on Sunday wouldn’t quite make it game over for South Africa, though their chances of progression would plummet dramatically. With this their third AFCON meeting, Namibia will have faced South Africa more times than any other opponent in the tournament. Each of their past two duels ended in South Africa victories, however. Bafana Bafana’s 4-1 win over Namibia in 1998 is also the last time a player scored more than three goals in a game at the Africa Cup of Nations. Benni McCarthy found the net four times in the space of 13 minutes for South Africa (8’, 11’, 19’, 21’). Another one-sided victory would go down a treat for South Africa considering their MD 1 defeat already has them playing catch-up with respect to their goal difference. Despite the nature of their opening matches, South Africa are considered strong favourites to beat Namibia on Sunday according to the Opta supercomputer. They won 49.9% of the latest pre-match simulations. Namibia came out on top 26.3% of the time. Although that makes South Africa nearly twice as likely to win, Namibia overcame greater odds against Tunisia; why can’t they do it again? In our pre-tournament predictions, the Opta supercomputer considered Namibia to be the joint least likely to go all the way, lifting the trophy in just 0.5% of simulations. That’s since improved, and they have overtaken South Africa in the process. Bafana Bafana’s chances of winning the tournament have dropped from 2.1% before MD 1 as a result of their defeat to Mali. Below you’ll find the current, up-to-date chances of progression for both teams all the way through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: South Africa: Ronwen Williams, Ricardo Goss, Veli Mothwa, Siyanda Xulu, Tapelo Xoki, Khuliso Mudau, Mothobi Mvala, Nyiko Mobbie, Nkosinathi Sibisi, Terrence Mashego, Thapelo Morena, Grant Kekana, Themba Zwane, Teboho Mokoena, Sibongiseni Mthethwa, Thabang Monare, Aubrey Modiba, Oswin Appollis, Sphephelo Sithole, Jayden Adams, Thapelo Maseko, Elias Mokwana, Percy Tau, Evidence Makgopa, Iqraam Rayners, Zakhele Lepasa, Mihlali Mayambela.

Zambia and Tanzania will bring the curtain down on Matchday 2 in Group F on Sunday, with both sides seeking their first win of the tournament. In fact, Tanzania are still looking for their first win in AFCON history, losing six and drawing one of the seven games they’ve played in the competition. Adel Amrouche’s side have shipped 3+ goals in four of these seven games, including a 3-0 defeat to Morocco on MD 1.  In truth, it was always going to be difficult for Tanzania to threaten the Atlas Lions, but it was alarming just how toothless they were going forwards. The Taifa Stars managed just two touches in Morocco’s box, their lowest tally in an Africa Cup of Nations game, while only Namibia (1) against Morocco in 2019, and Zimbabwe (1 against Guinea in 2022) have had fewer on record. Zambia also struggled to generate much by way of a goal threat on MD 1. But despite only mustering three shots against DR Congo, they managed to escape with a 1-1 draw. We suppose that’s what can happen when one of your players scores from almost 40 yards out, as Kings Kangwa did in the first half. His effort is unsurprisingly the furthest goal scored at this year’s tournament, and it’s also the longest-distance goal by a Zambian since Opta began collecting such data in 2010. The data doesn’t suggest we’ll get a lot of goals – these are the two teams who had the fewest shots on MD 1 after all – but perhaps each side will be able to cut loose a little more against weaker opposition.  This will be the first ever encounter between Zambia and Tanzania at the Africa Cup of Nations. In all competitions, Zambia are unbeaten in their last four matches against Tanzania (W2 D2). The two teams last met in Group D at the 2020 African Nations Championship, where Zambia ran out 2-0 winners.   The Opta supercomputer makes Zambia the favourites for this tie, giving them a 45.8% of taking all three points. Tanzania are given a 28.9% chance of causing an upset, while the draw is an outside shout at 25.3%.  In our overall tournament predictions, these two sides are our outsiders to progress from Group F. At the time of writing, Zambia have a 59.5% chance of qualifying from the group, behind DR Congo (63.2%) and Morocco (98.1%), while Tanzania have a faint 28.9% shot of reaching the last 16.

We look ahead to this game with our Morocco vs DR Congo prediction and preview. Morocco enter Matchday 2 at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations with expectations only growing about their chances of glory. They have only won the competition once before – back in 1976 – and have also only made the final on one other occasion (2004), so they don’t have much AFCON pedigree, but their current team is arguably their greatest ever. Following on from finishing fourth at the World Cup in Qatar, Morocco are among the tournament favourites in the Ivory Coast and will have only strengthened any belief in their chances with a hugely convincing 3-0 win over Tanzania on MD 1 in Group F. They will come up against stronger opposition in this tournament, but having kept their opponents to only two shots and a total of just 0.03 xG, they showed just how defensively sound this team is. It was that defence upon which their remarkable World Cup run was built, and it will be key to their progress at AFCON 2023, too. They will do very well to keep their opponents as quiet here given DR Congo had a tournament-high 25 shots on MD 1. They could only find the net once, though, and were made to pay for their profligacy, ending up drawing their match against Zambia 1-1 despite their opponents generating just 0.2 xG from three shots. DR Congo have plenty of attacking talent, with Brentford’s Yoane Wissa – scorer of their only goal at AFCON 2023 so far – and Galatasaray’s Cédric Bakambu leading the line. They have a tough task on their hands against Morocco, but they will believe they have enough in their ranks to cause any opponent problems. Wissa alone had six shots worth a combined total of 1.29 xG on MD 1. DR Congo have won the AFCON twice before – in 1968 as Congo-Kinshasa and in 1974 as Zaire – so they are the more successful side in this competition. They come into this game very much as underdogs, though, and will have to be at their best to get anything from it. These sides are well acquainted with one another at the Africa Cup of Nations. This will be their sixth AFCON meeting, with all five of their previous encounters also coming in the group stage; only Egypt and Nigeria (seven) have met on more occasions in the AFCON group stage. Each side has won one of those previous five meetings, with three games ending in a draw. Games between these two tend to be low-scoring, with only eight goals scored in their five meetings (four apiece), and neither side ever having scored more than once in any of those matches. DR Congo got the better of their last AFCON meeting with Morocco, coming out 1-0 victors in 2017, but the sides have met more recently. They played out a World Cup qualifying play-off in 2022, with the first leg ending in a 1-1 draw. However, Morocco showed their superiority in the second leg, winning 4-1 to secure their place at the final tournament in Qatar, and we all know what happened after that. Morocco are favourites to win this match, with the Opta supercomputer playing out a win for the North Africans in 57.7% of its 10,000 pre-match simulations. DR Congo, meanwhile, won 21.2% of the time, leaving 21.1% drawn. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Morocco as third favourites to lift the trophy. However, at the time of writing, they have crept up to the lead the way as most likely AFCON 2023 winners, winning the tournament in 15.6% of the supercomputer’s latest 10,000 simulations.  DR Congo, on the other hand, are a mid-ranked team in terms of their chances of winning another AFCON title. Their opening-round 1-1 draw with Zambia has left their chances on the same level as they were before a ball was kicked (2.4%).  Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Morocco: Munir Mohamedi, Yassine Bounou, Mehdi Benabid, Nayef Aguerd, Achraf Hakimi, Romain Saïss, Chadi Riad, Yahya Attiat-Allah, Abdel Abqar, Yunis Abdelhamid, Noussair Mazraoui, Mohamed Chibi, Sofyan Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Amir Richardson, Selim Amallah, Oussama El Azzouzi, Amine Harit, Azzedine Ounahi, Bilal El Khannouss, Sofiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri, Abde Ezzalzouli, Ismael Saibari, Tarik Tissoudali, Amine Adli, Ayoub El Kaabi.

How will the Hammers respond to their midweek FA Cup exit? If David Moyes thought a run of four Premier League games unbeaten – a sequence including victories over Manchester United and Arsenal – was enough to silence his doubters, he was made to think again as Tuesday’s FA Cup defeat at Bristol City reignited the debate over his long-term future at the London Stadium. Can the Hammers bounce back at Sheffield United on Sunday? An early mix-up between Konstantinos Mavropanos and Lukasz Fabianski proved costly for West Ham in midweek, with Bristol City’s Tommy Conway capitalising as the Irons suffered their first third-round exit since 2016-17. In a further blow for Moyes, Saïd Benrahma was sent off for a petulant kick on Joe Williams and will now serve a three-match ban. Benrahma’s suspension comes at a dreadful time for West Ham, who are already without several attacking stars. While Mohammed Kudus is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana, Lucas Paquetá and Michail Antonio remain sidelined for the trip to Bramall Lane. West Ham, could, however, have Jarrod Bowen back after tests showed the forward’s ankle injury is not as serious as first feared. Bowen has nine goal involvements in nine away Premier League games this season (seven goals, two assists), a tally only bettered by Manchester City’s Erling Haaland (10). Nevertheless, in Paquetá (0.17) and Kudus (0.14), West Ham will be without their two leading players for open-play expected assists (xA) per 90 minutes in the Premier League this term. In their absence, they might hope a more direct approach pays dividends. Sheffield United have conceded a Premier League-high 13 goals from crosses this season, and no player in the competition boasts more assists via crosses than West Ham’s James Ward-Prowse (five). Only Newcastle United’s Kieran Trippier (53) and Luton Town’s Alfie Doughty (42) have registered more successful crosses than Ward-Prowse’s 37 in Premier League action this term. There has been little love lost between Sheffield United and West Ham since 2006-07, when Carlos Tevez inspired the Hammers to safety at the Blades’ expense despite his arrival in east London being found to have breached Premier League rules. The hosts should need no additional motivation in their quest for three points on Sunday, though, with Chris Wilder’s side entering Matchday 21 eight points adrift of safety. The Blades are winless in four league matches and suffered a damaging 3-2 defeat to Luton in their last outing at Bramall Lane on Boxing Day. While their results have not yet caught up with their performances, Sheffield United have at least improved their underlying numbers since Wilder replaced Paul Heckingbottom last month. Having averaged 2.8 goals conceded, 19 shots faced and 2.23 expected goals against (xGA) per game through 14 league matches under Heckingbottom in 2023-24, they have averaged 1.7 goals conceded, 13.7 shots faced and 1.52 xGA per game in six league fixtures since Wilder’s return. While the Blades have tightened up somewhat under Wilder, they have still conceded 49 goals in 20 league matches in 2023-24, and they could now become just the third side to ship a half-century of goals through 21 games or fewer in a single Premier League campaign. Barnsley conceded 50 in their first 19 outings of 1997-98, while West Bromwich Albion reached the figure in 21 matches in 2020-21. Unsurprisingly, both teams went on to be relegated. Sheffield United also need someone to step up in front of goal if they are to avoid that same fate – could Oli McBurnie be that man? He has scored in three successive home Premier League appearances but has finished on the losing side in each of those games (versus Manchester United, Bournemouth and Luton), becoming the first player in the competition’s history to do so.  As for team news for Sunday’s hosts, they have endured their fair share of injury problems this season but could have several players returning for this game. Auston Trusty, Anel Ahmedhodžić and George Baldock should all be available after missing their 4-0 FA Cup win over Gillingham, while Jayden Bogle will be assessed after suffering a concussion before that match. West Ham have won their last three Premier League games against Sheffield United, keeping a clean sheet on each occasion. Bowen and Tomás Soucek were on target in September’s reverse fixture, with West Ham cruising to a 2-0 win at the London Stadium in what was Moyes’ 900th league game as a manager. That run has come after the Hammers only managed two victories in their previous 12 league meetings with the Blades, drawing six and losing four. Sheffield United lost 1-0 when they last hosted West Ham in league action, with Sébastien Haller hitting the Hammers’ winner in November 2020. They could now lose back-to-back home league games against West Ham for the first time since February 1963. West Ham are looking to preserve a proud defensive record on Sunday, having kept four successive clean sheets in the Premier League against Wolves, Man Utd, Arsenal and Brighton. That is despite Moyes’ men facing 77 shots across those matches. They are now looking to keep five successive league clean sheets for the first time since doing so as a second-tier side between December 1990 and January 1991. They last recorded five straight shutouts in the top flight between November and December 1985. The Hammers have also won their last 11 Premier League games against teams starting the day bottom of the table, with only Man City (a current run of 12) ever enjoying a longer such streak in the competition’s history. Sheffield United, meanwhile, have taken just seven points from their 10 home games this season, with only Burnley (four) earning fewer on their own turf in the Premier League. The hosts will be keen to avoid another slow start, having conceded first in a league-high 16 Premier League games this season, only salvaging two draws in those matches. By contrast, only Tottenham (five games) and Arsenal (six) have conceded first less often than West Ham (seven).

Moyes’ men won 51.5% of 10,000 pre-match simulations conducted by the supercomputer, with Sheffield United only triumphing in 21.1%, and 27.4% finishing level. In the supercomputer’s 2023-24 predictions, meanwhile, Sheffield United are given just a 2.6% chance of avoiding relegation. They finish bottom of the table in 63.6% of our season simulations, with only champions City assigned a higher chance of finishing in a particular position, finishing top in 65.0% of scenarios. Despite some fans’ misgivings over Moyes, West Ham are still seen as European hopefuls, with sixth (25.3%) their most common position across our projections. Enjoy this?

Reports suggest he will either stay at Paris Saint-Germain, join Real Madrid or move to Liverpool. Which team would suit him best, though? The subject of Kylian Mbappé’s future is everywhere, though that has been the case for several years. Arguably the world’s biggest football superstar has scored 27 goals for Monaco, 238 for Paris Saint-Germain, 46 for France, has won the World Cup and scored a hat-trick in a World Cup final, and that wasn’t even in the final he won. All that despite only turning 25 in December. Mbappé is out of contract at Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season and surely has his choice of any club. Recent reports suggest he’s narrowed his options to just three: staying at PSG, as he chose to do two years ago when his previous deal was close to expiring, heading to Real Madrid, or moving to Liverpool. A lot of the chatter around Mbappé’s decision has focused on the finances. PSG seem likely to offer him the biggest pay packet in an attempt to convince him to stay; Madrid apparently can’t/won’t splash the cash as they used to in the Galáctico era; while Liverpool traditionally don’t hand out big contracts to new signings. If money is the deciding factor, he will almost certainly stay in Paris. However, Mbappé insisted two years ago that his intentions were purely sporting: “We talked for months about the sporting project, hours on image rights and minutes on money. It lasted five minutes, it was very fast,” he said. So, we thought we’d take him at his word and help Mr Mbappé make his decision from a sporting perspective. We’ve looked at PSG, Real Madrid and Liverpool to see which team might suit him best. Mbappé has had a productive time in the French capital since joining from Monaco in 2017, scoring 238 goals and recording 90 assists in 285 games in all competitions. He has won five Ligue 1 titles, three Coupes de France, two Coupes de la Ligue and three Trophées des Champions. You might therefore wonder why there’s any question of Mbappé leaving his hometown club having been so successful. As well as the argument that he’s done as much as he can domestically in France, he has been Ligue 1’s top scorer in each of the last five seasons – equalling the league record set by Jean-Pierre Papin at Marseille between 1988 and 1992. There’s also the fact PSG continue to fail where it arguably matters most to them and him, in the UEFA Champions League. Mbappé burst onto the scene with Monaco when they won the Ligue 1 title in 2016-17, but it was their run to the Champions League semi-finals that season where he caught worldwide attention, scoring six goals in nine games. That helped earn him a nine-figure move to Paris, but now in his seventh season at the Parc des Princes, he has only reached the final four of the competition twice since. PSG went out in the round of 16 in Mbappé’s first two seasons at the club, before reaching the final in his third. They lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon and dusted themselves down to reach the semi-finals in 2020-21, losing to Manchester City. They have gone out in the last 16 in the last two campaigns and stumbled through their group this season, needing to recover from a 4-1 hammering at Newcastle United to finish second behind Borussia Dortmund. They will face Real Sociedad when the Champions League resumes next month. Club President Nasser Al-Khelaïfi recently made it clear how much he wants to keep Mbappé. “I am not trying to hide anything. I want Kylian Mbappé to stay at PSG. He’s the best player in the world and the best club for him is PSG,” Al-Khelaïfi told RMC Sport. “He is central to our project.” The project Al-Khelaïfi referred to is how he will hope to convince Mbappé that the future is bright. “We have made mistakes and this is normal. Now we have a young team, with French players, and we are not in a hurry, this is for the long-term,” Al-Khelaïfi added. But does Mbappé still suit this evolving PSG side? He seems to be thriving at the moment, scoring 19 goals in 17 Ligue 1 games already this season, with PSG eight points ahead of Nice at the top of the table. Having a star-studded front three of Mbappé, Neymar and Lionel Messi in recent years didn’t get the club any closer to winning the Champions League, but this season the 2018 World Cup winner has been the focal point, playing through the middle of the attack mostly with Ousmane Dembélé to his right and Bradley Barcola to his left. As you can see below, he has spent over 70% of his time in Ligue 1 down the middle this season, though he has said in the past he prefers to play with a number nine rather than being one (which we’ll come to later). With other options in attack such as Randal Kolo Muani, Marco Asensio and Gonçalo Ramos, you could argue PSG are well-stocked enough to absorb Mbappé’s departure. It would require one or more to step up significantly though considering how important he is to Luis Enrique’s side. Mbappé has scored 26 goals in all competitions this season, 19 more than any other PSG player, while only Dembélé (seven) and talented teenager Warren Zaïre-Emery (five) have more than his four assists. He has taken 126 shots, 76 more than any teammate, and only Dembélé (52) and Achraf Hakimi (42) have created more than his 41 chances from open play. Mbappé has also attempted (134) and completed (71) more dribbles than any of his teammates. Indeed, only four players in Europe’s top five leagues have attempted more, while just four have completed more. He is the figurehead of PSG and it would be a huge blow to the club to lose him, hence the reported eye-watering sums being offered to him to stay. Mbappé might just suit being the main man now that Neymar and Messi have departed, and he can look after his younger brother Ethan, who is starting to come through at the club. Should he leave Paris, though, one persistent suitor will be the first on everyone’s minds. In 2022, when Mbappé surprisingly chose to sign an extension with PSG instead of joining Real Madrid on a free transfer, the La Liga giants were humiliated. They were all in on Mbappé, with fans pointing to the fact he had been pictured as a youngster in his bedroom with posters all over his walls of then Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo. They wanted Mbappé to be their new poster boy, but at the 11th hour, he chose to stay in France. The damage caused led to suggestions they’d refuse to pursue Mbappé again in future. Two years is a long time in football, though. Hurt feelings is one thing, but Real Madrid are in the business of winning trophies and being able to sign a generational talent on a free transfer is not an opportunity to be passed up. Then again, recent reports suggested the club had set Mbappé a deadline of 15 January to make his decision, which he appears to have missed. It seems unlikely they’ll turn their nose up at him if he decides the Santiago Bernabéu is his destination in the next few months, though. As for the player, if you want to win the Champions League then why not move to a club that has won it 14 times – twice as many as anyone else – and has taken home five of the last 10? So, where would Mbappé fit in Carlo Ancelotti’s side? Plenty of questions have been asked as to whether he could play alongside Vinícius Júnior, who also likes to play off the left. It’s an interesting conundrum.  As mentioned before, Mbappé does predominantly play as the central striker for PSG. However, when you look at his touch-zone map below, you can see that he seldom stays in the centre for too long. It therefore begs the question of whether he and Vinícius could share the same space, or could they work out a system where the Brazilian moves into the middle when Mbappé floats out left? There is certainly a space in the frontline for Mbappé. With all due respect to Joselu, the 33-year-old wasn’t signed last summer to be Karim Benzema’s long-term replacement. The assumption was that the former Newcastle and Espanyol striker was merely a placeholder until Mbappé arrived; he also went towards their homegrown quota in the Champions League given he came through Madrid’s academy. Back when Christophe Galtier was PSG boss, Mbappé indicated he was not particularly happy with his central role at club level, preferring how he played for France with Olivier Giroud. “I play differently [with\\xa0France],” he said on international duty in September 2022. “I am tasked with other things here compared to with my club. I have a lot more freedom here. The coach knows that there is a number nine like Olivier who occupies the defence and I can drift around and move into space. In Paris, it’s different, there isn’t that. I am asked to be the pivot.” Ancelotti does sometimes mix things up, occasionally playing Vinícius in a front two with Rodrygo. It worked to great effect in last Sunday’s 4-1 win against Barcelona in the Supercopa de España final, with the Brazilian pair scoring all four goals between them (Vinícius – 3, Rodrygo – 1). You could certainly see a scenario where Mbappé played alongside either one in a system with Jude Bellingham just behind them. And that’s another key thing. For all the moves PSG are making to provide a strong, young team for Mbappé to lead, Madrid have done the same. In recent years they’ve future-proofed their midfield with the additions of Mbappé’s international teammates Eduardo Camavinga and Aurélien Tchouameni, as well as the phenomenal Bellingham, while 18-year-old Turkish talent Arda Güler is getting rave reviews after recently making his debut. Ancelotti might also argue he could do with Mbappé’s goals. Apart from Bellingham (17), no other Madrid player has even scored half the amount that Mbappé has in all competitions this season. After signing his extension in 2022, Mbappé insisted: “I didn’t say no to Madrid, I said yes to France.” Real Madrid will be hoping the player now says “sí” to Spain. Looking at the Opta Player Radar comparison tool, it’s interesting to note that three of the four players in Europe’s top five leagues who profile most similarly to Mbappé this season are Vinícius, Rodrygo and Mohamed Salah.  Which brings us nicely to… You should always do what your mum tells you, or at least that’s what Liverpool fans will argue. Back in 2022, Mbappé revealed that he previously held talks with the Premier League side about a move because he loves his mum, who also happens to be his agent and supports Liverpool. “I talked to Liverpool because it’s the favourite club of my mum. My mum loves Liverpool,” he told The Telegraph. “It’s a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them. It’s a big club.” On the face of it, this seems to be the least likely of the three options for Mbappé. There’s his love of France and Paris, his supposed idolisation of Real Madrid, and as mentioned, the significant financial outlay required that Liverpool seem unlikely to match. Then again, reports of their continued interest in the player as well as his admiration of them just will not go away. Last summer, it would’ve seemed impossible. Liverpool were coming off a poor season that saw them dumped out of the Champions League last 16 by Real Madrid (6-2 on aggregate) and fail to qualify for this season’s competition after finishing fifth in the Premier League. However, Jürgen Klopp’s men have recovered this season and lead the Premier League after 20 matches. They have lost just one game in the league all season and remain in all four competitions they entered in 2023-24. When it comes to the Champions League, again, a move to Anfield would probably give Mbappé a greater chance of winning it than he has now. While Liverpool might not be taking part this season, they have a rich heritage in the competition, both historically and recently. Their six wins overall is twice as many as any other English club, and only Madrid (14) and AC Milan (7) have won more. They last lifted the trophy in 2019 and have reached three of the last six finals. Where would Mbappé fit in Klopp’s team, though? When it comes to the attack, the German already has plenty of options. Mohamed Salah has things locked down on the right of Liverpool’s front three, while Luis Díaz is usually seen on the left. Diogo Jota and Darwin Núñez can either play through the middle or on the left, while Cody Gakpo mostly appears centrally and has even covered in midfield this season. Do Liverpool even need Mbappé then?  Well, yes, because he’s Kylian Mbappé. Mbappé’s predilection for drifting out to the left means playing alongside any one of Núñez, Jota or Gakpo could work similarly to how it would with Vinícius or currently does to an extent with Barcola at PSG. A fluid partnership, switching roles with regularity. Liverpool already have a reliable goalscorer in Salah, who has 18 in all competitions this season. However, it has been suggested that the only way the club could afford Mbappé is if Salah – their highest earner – leaves in the summer. That would put the Frenchman under big pressure to immediately reproduce the numbers he does in Ligue 1. It would also mean Liverpool have to find another right-sided attacker as none of their other forward options have much, if any, experience on that side. We recently looked at that issue and how Liverpool would cope without Salah while he’s at the Africa Cup of Nations. Interestingly, Mbappé and Salah have an almost identical shot conversion percentage this season in league games (Mbappé – 21.6%, Salah – 21.5%), while the Frenchman bests the Egyptian for non-penalty expected goals (xG) per 90 (Mbappé – 0.69, Salah – 0.49). He wouldn’t need to worry about having chances created for him, either. No team in the Premier League has had as many shots as Liverpool’s 380 and no-one can match their xG total of 44.91. When Mbappé said in 2022 he liked playing with a number nine “who occupies the defence”, he had players like Núñez in mind. The former Benfica man does plenty of defender-occupying, even if his own shot conversion rate could do with improving (8.6%). Klopp likes his forwards to work hard defensively too, which people might question when it comes to Mbappé. However, in Ligue 1 this season he has averaged 0.76 possession wins in the final third per 90, more than Núñez (0.56) and Jota (0.54) in the Premier League, and only just behind Salah (0.77). Should Mbappé pay attention to such things (and why wouldn’t he?), Liverpool are also one place ahead of PSG in the Opta Power Rankings, though Real Madrid sit above both in second place. In a recent interview with GQ magazine, Mbappé revealed he asks friend and basketball legend LeBron James for career advice. Given the Los Angeles Lakers star is a minority shareholder of Liverpool, perhaps that could be another thing in the club’s favour. Wherever Mbappé is at the start of the 2024-25 season, he is sure to continue being one of the world’s most exciting players. All three clubs are at the start of new eras and Mbappé would be a worthy poster boy for any of them. Either way, can it please be a long contract so we can finally have a season without endlessly discussing his future? What do you think Kylian Mbappé should do?

For a team in freefall like Brentford, January might normally provide hope in the shape of the transfer window. But in this unique set of circumstances, Thomas Frank is instead looking forward to something slightly different. Ivan Toney completed his eight-month ban for breaking gambling rules on Wednesday ahead of a much-anticipated return to action when Brentford host Nottingham Forest this weekend. “To get Ivan back will be like signing an unbelievably good striker,” Frank said last month. The ‘like a new signing’ cliché would scarcely before have been more accurate. pic.twitter.com/6ZuIKQxbmU Everyone knows how important Toney has been throughout his Brentford career. He scored the goals that got them promoted from the Championship in his first season at the club, and has been the only of their players to reach double figures in either of their two full seasons in the top flight… and he did so in both of them. Last season, he was the Premier League’s third-highest scorer, behind Erling Haaland (36) and Harry Kane (30), scoring 20 goals. So, to lose him for the first half of 2023-24 was a massive blow. It wasn’t like selling your biggest asset when his stock was at its highest, because there were no incoming funds to use for his replacement. Brentford basically just had to make do without their biggest goal threat. After his ban took effect last season, Brentford won all three Premier League matches that he missed in May, while for a decent chunk of this season, it seemed they could contend with his absence. After four games, they were still unbeaten, and Bryan Mbeumo (four goals) was the Premier League’s second-highest scorer behind Haaland (six). Neal Maupay was re-signed on loan but to say he isn’t much of a clinical finisher is a bit of an understatement. He has underperformed compared to his xG to a greater extent than any other player since Opta started calculating expected goals (xG) numbers in the Premier League, with 29 goals from 45.7 xG; an underperformance of 16.7. But then things were going so swimmingly for Brentford that even he started scoring, netting crucial openers in wins over West Ham (3-2) and Luton (3-1). In Mbuemo, Maupay and the lively Yoann Wissa, they seemed to have enough firepower in their ranks to get by. After 11 games, Brentford were ninth, 10 points clear of the relegation zone and within four of the top six. As recently as after their 14th game, they were still in the top half. Then came the fall. Since the Luton win in early December, Brentford have lost five consecutive games and slipped to within three points of the relegation zone. It’s the club’s longest losing streak in league games since seven defeats in a row in March 1993 in the second tier, and their longest in the top flight since 1947. It leaves them closer to the bottom three both in points terms (three points) and league positions (two places) than they have ever been later than Matchday 1 in their three seasons in the Premier League. Relegation might be creeping into the concerns of the board, the fans and even the manager. Toney’s return could not be more timely. But they should also be careful not to pin too much of their hopes on Toney. He is obviously going to make a difference, but can he alone end this terrible run of form and help the team back into mid-table? Over the course of the first 14 games of the 2023-24 Premier League season, only Liverpool (1.89) produced more non-penalty xG per game than Brentford (1.86). Frank’s side created lots of high-quality chances, but only Everton (-0.45 per game) underperformed their xG to a greater extent than Brentford (-0.43 per game), who scored six goals fewer than their chances suggested they should have. During this period, Brentford players – Maupay (-2.6), Mbeumo (-2.2) and Wissa (-2.1) – made up three of the five worst Premier League culprits for underperformance compared to their xG. It was easy to conclude at this point in the season that finishing off chances was the team’s problem, and Toney’s return could solve that. Brentford were still within touching distance of the European places with six weeks of Toney’s ban remaining, so there was plenty of reason to believe that they could aim for an improvement on last season’s ninth-place finish. Since then, though, their xG has dropped to 1.1 per game, the fifth lowest in the league, ahead only of the bottom three and an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace. And their finishing has got even worse, too, dropping to an underperformance of -0.5 per game. It’s worth mentioning here that Toney outscored his expected goals last season, with his 20 goals coming from 18.7 xG. So, over the last five games, Brentford have continued to finish poorly, but they have also created far fewer chances. It’s only a five-game period but it’s not like they faced a particularly tough run of fixtures to skew the numbers. In that time, they have lost to bottom-of-the-league Sheffield United and to two out-of-form teams in Brighton (one win in eight when they met) and Crystal Palace (no wins in eight when they met). Their other two losses came at home to Aston Villa and Wolves, who have seven wins from 21 away games between them this season. Brentford will have gone into every one of those games with a decent chance of a point or more, and they came away from all five empty-handed. Such a poor run of form suggests Brentford’s issues right now are bigger than the fact they are without their best goalscorer. Toney isn’t just a goalscorer, though. The fact that, in his absence, Brentford have had to change much of their game proves as much. Brentford aren’t a long-ball team in the Tony Pulis sense, but they do go direct more than most other Premier League teams, and Toney was key to that last season. They played more long passes in total (2,312) and a higher proportion of their total passes were sent long (17%) than any other team in the top flight. With Toney up top, they could go long as a tactic whenever they wanted, and they used his aerial presence and ability to bring the ball down under pressure to great effect. This season, however, they rank sixth for long passes (1,110) and ninth for proportion of passes sent long (13%). It’s not necessarily a negative to play less long-ball football, but these numbers do serve to highlight quite how big the adaptation has been for Frank and his team. There have also been direct negative consequences to Brentford keeping the ball on the floor more, with Toney able to provide an out-ball for his defenders when they were under pressure. Last season, Brentford conceded only five goals following a high turnover (when the opposition win the ball within 40m of the Brentford goal) – or one every 7.6 games. At the midway point in 2023-24, meanwhile, they have already conceded more goals after a high turnover (seven) than in the whole of last season, doing so every 2.7 games, with only Bournemouth (eight) having let in more. Of course, there is far more to consider here than merely Toney’s absence, but it is certainly a contributing factor. Toney’s impact on Brentford’s own pressing game has been missed, too. Brentford have gone from being the most effective pressing side in the league, having scored a league-high nine goals following a high turnover in 2022-23, to the second worst, with their total of one goal-ending high turnover this season only better than Luton (0). There have been other key absentees, though, particularly of late. Mbeumo’s serious ankle injury could rule him out for several months, Rico Henry could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, and Wissa, Frank Onyeka and Saman Ghoddos are now off at the Africa Cup of Nations. Kristoffer Ajer, Aaron Hickey and Kevin Schade have all missed significant periods, too. So, while Toney’s return will be extremely welcome, it remains to be seen if it is sufficient alone to turn the season around and end this recent slump in form. Then there are the questions about Toney’s longer-term future. Chelsea and Arsenal are both reportedly looking for a new number nine, and Toney has spoken before of his desire to play in the Champions League. With only 18 months left on his contract, the ball is very nearly in his court when it comes to where he could be playing for the next few years. However, recent results will have convinced his manager further that he needs Toney in a Brentford shirt, at least for the rest of the season. “I think it’s very clear, I don’t want to let him go,” Frank said last week. “I want to keep him as long as possible and I only have that in mind. My only focus is getting him ready for Nottingham Forest [on 20 January].” With the bottom three teams pulling Brentford dangerously close to the relegation zone, and Luton in particular having improved enough to suggest we might just have a relegation battle on our hands, Frank won’t want to risk heading into the second half of the season without Toney, even if another club was willing to splash out on him. Survival could hinge on Toney’s return, so he could be worth more to Brentford than any amount of money a bigger team might realistically offer. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to Saturday’s Premier League match with our Arsenal vs Crystal Palace prediction and preview. A spirited draw at fellow Premier League title contenders Liverpool had Arsenal celebrating Christmas at the top of the tree, but Mikel Arteta’s side must now find a way to respond when they host Crystal Palace at Emirates Stadium on Saturday after three disappointing losses followed that Anfield clash. Arsenal manager Arteta may have been wishing for more clinical finishing and improved set-piece defending in his New Year’s resolutions after a profligate showing saw his side fall to a surprise 2-0 home defeat to West Ham United on 28 December before a similarly poor showing resulted in a 2-1 reverse against Fulham on New Year’s Eve.\\xa0 Bukayo Saka‘s early opener proved entirely redundant at Craven Cottage against Fulham, who roared back with goals from Raúl Jiménez and Bobby De Cordova-Reid to ensure Arsenal wrapped up their 2023 with back-to-back defeats to London rivals. Those derby-day blues leave Arteta’s men fourth in the league table, five points adrift of leaders Liverpool and three behind both Aston Villa and Manchester City, although the latter pair already played in last weekend’s first five Matchday 21 fixtures. There was no redemption in the FA Cup third round either for Arsenal as Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool dealt another psychological blow with a 2-0 triumph at the Emirates, where a Jakub Kiwior own goal and Luis Díaz’s late strike did the damage. Arsenal have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions, losing each of their last three – their fewest wins over a seven-game period under Arteta, who will at least hope to have Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko back for Saturday’s kick-off. Jesus’ return should take some of the attacking burden from Saka, who has been involved in 15 goals in his last 18 Premier League London derby matches, scoring six and assisting nine – three of those came in Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Crystal Palace in this exact fixture last term. The rest of Arsenal’s team news is as expected: Jurriën Timber, Thomas Partey and Fábio Vieira all remain out injured, while Japan’s Takehiro Tomiyasu and Egypt’s Mohamed Elneny are competing at the Asia Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively. After a similarly underwhelming December, pressure appeared to be mounting on Palace manager Roy Hodgson, though his side ended an eight-game winless run in the league with a 3-1 victory over London rivals Brentford at Selhurst Park in their last top-flight outing. Michael Olise scored twice along with a goal for Eberechi Eze. However, a much-needed Premier League triumph came at a cost as Olise suffered a reoccurrence of a hamstring injury and will subsequently miss the remainder of January having already sat out of a 1-1 draw with Everton in the FA Cup third round and the defeat in Wednesday’s replay. On Saturday, Palace will be looking to win consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2023, when they won each of their first three following Hodgson’s return to the club, to lift them from their 14th-place league-table position. They sit just five points clear of 18th-placed Luton Town heading into this weekend’s MD 21 clashes, although the reported points deduction for Nottingham Forest and Everton may ease relegation fears at Selhurst Park. Hodgson remains without Joel Ward, Sam Johnstone, Rob Holding, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi and Cheick Doucouré, while Ghana’s Jordan Ayew is at the AFCON, though the veteran manager can rely upon one star who will hit a milestone at the Emirates. Eze will likely make his 100th Premier League appearance in this match, the 19th player to do so for Palace. Aged 25 years and 205 days when Saturday’s kick-off comes, he’d be the third youngest to reach the milestone for the Eagles, after Tyrick Mitchell (24y 15d) and Wilfried Zaha (24y 192d). Palace have struggled on their trips to the Emirates, winning just one of their last 12 away Premier League games at Arsenal (D4 L7), with their only victory in that period coming in a 3-2 triumph in April 2019 thanks to goals from Christian Benteke, Wilfried Zaha and James McArthur. Arsenal have won their last three league games against Palace, too, having previously managed just one win in eight Premier League matches with the Selhurst Park side (D5 L2) from 2018-19 to 2021-22. That three-game winning streak includes a 1-0 win in the reverse fixture this season as Martin Ødegaard’s 54th-minute penalty proved the difference despite Takehiro Tomiyasu’s sending off 13 minutes after the opener. Arteta must atone for a poor run of form as Arsenal have taken just four points from their last 15 available in the Premier League, winning once, drawing once and losing three. They had only dropped nine points from their opening 15 league games this season beforehand (W11 D3 L1). Including the FA Cup defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates, Arsenal have lost their last three matches in all competitions, last losing four in a row in March 2018. Their last two at home have both finished in 2-0 defeats (Liverpool and West Ham) – they’ve not lost three in a row at home without scoring since a run of four in November/December 1908. Having suffered back-to-back defeats against fellow capital-city clubs Fulham and West Ham, Arsenal have lost their last two Premier League London derby matches, as many as in their previous 25 combined (W17 D6). The Gunners haven’t lost three consecutive such London derbies in the league since March 1993. However, Palace have also picked up fewer points in Premier League London derbies this season than any other side (six – W1 D3 L3). Away from home, Hodgson’s men have won just one of their last 17 matches against fellow London clubs (D9 L7), a 2-1 victory at West Ham in November 2022.

For Dominic Solanke, the road to fulfilling the promise he showed as a teenager has been a lengthy one. It’s easy to forget how long he’s been around at this level; after all, October 2024 will mark 10 years since his first-team bow at Chelsea, where he became the club’s youngest ever Champions League player a little over a month after his 17th birthday. Considering his reputation in youth football at the time and the regard he was held in by Chelsea, many might’ve thought Solanke would go on to experience Champions League nights on a regular basis, but only another three appearances in the competition have followed over the subsequent nine and a bit years. The 2023-24 campaign has been something of a coming-of-age story for Solanke, however. No more is he that once-hyped English striker who looks more at home in the Championship; no, now he’s one of the Premier League’s in-form strikers and an absolutely vital component in his team’s setup as he prepares to face Liverpool – another of his former clubs – this Sunday. His transformation has been considerable, and swift. Questions were still being asked about him as recently as last season, with Solanke going 1,020 minutes (or 17 hours and 20 minutes) without a Premier League goal for Bournemouth between November 2022 and April 2023, but this term he’s enjoyed a decisiveness that we’ve simply never seen from him before at top-flight level. In 2023-24, Solanke is averaging 0.64 goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League, which is a huge uptick from his record at this level before this season. Over his 96 top-flight games prior to August 2023, he’d only scored 10 times, at a rate of 0.17 every 90 minutes; his total of 12 this term is already clear of that. His numbers in front of goal have improved practically across the board. He’s now converting 18.2% of his shots, compared to 7.1% across those 96 prior Premier League games; his shot frequency is up to 3.5 per 90 from 2.3; and his big-chance conversion rate has more than doubled from 26.1% to 56.3%. Of course, looking at his output over 96 games is slightly flawed as it gives as much weight to his relative formative years at Liverpool and early days at Bournemouth – when he went 30 hours and 8 minutes without a Premier League goal – as it does to last season, when Solanke was back in the Premier League after a couple of character-building years in the Championship. Nevertheless, even from the 2022-23 campaign there has been a major change for the better in terms of productivity, with his increase of 1.1 from 2.4 shots per 90 minutes a good starting point for a striker; he’s getting more shots away than ever before in his top-flight career. But most importantly, Solanke is combining that improved shot frequency with receiving the ball in better positions now. That can probably be at least partly attributed to his teammates providing more reliable service, but there’s little question he’s matured as a centre-forward and confidence is flowing through him. Among those to have played at least 500 minutes in the Premier League this term, only eight have a better non-penalty expected goals (xG) per 90 record than his 0.54, which highlights how he’s getting shots away in threatening positions. His best non-penalty xG average over a single Premier League season for Bournemouth had been 0.29 last term; he’s way up on that, though Solanke’s also proving far more dependable with the chances that fall to him, scoring 0.58 non-penalty goals every 90 minutes in 2023-24 after never going above 0.19 for a full Premier League season beforehand. But to focus just on what Solanke is now offering in front of goal would be to do him – and Bournemouth – a disservice. Sure, as a centre-forward, being able to score frequently is obviously an important skill to have, especially given his record in this regard had previously been poor in the top flight. However, it’s what he offers off the ball that helps ensure Solanke is influential beyond the opposition’s penalty box – and he feels this has actually positively impacted the positions he’s getting into. A fine physical specimen, Solanke has that blend of athleticism and game intelligence that can make such a difference in the Premier League, particularly in a team like Iraola’s Bournemouth. “Part of my success is because the manager loves pressing high,” Solanke told The Times in an interview last month. “I’m high up the pitch, in the centre of the goal much of the time, and not having to drop back too much and am finding myself in good positions, more than last season probably. The manager’s style definitely suits me.” Iraola’s Rayo Vallecano side were renowned for their distinct style of play, which centred on an aggressive approach to applying pressure and winning the ball back as high up the pitch as possible. They recorded 68 high turnovers that led to a shot in La Liga last season, which was second only to Bayern Munich (73) among all clubs in the top five leagues; it was a cornerstone of their system and its successful implementation was a major reason the former Athletic Bilbao player was so sought-after prior to making the move to Bournemouth. “We couldn’t take in all the information at first,” Solanke added in the same interview. “For me, I’m pressing with a No. 10 behind me and, at first, our timing was off. We didn’t know when to press or to drop, but now it’s second nature as the manager has gone through it many times and it’s embedded in our heads and we are all on the same wavelength. It’s natural now.” Evidently. No Premier League player has recorded more pressures in the final third than Solanke this season (288) and he also ranks as high as 13th for pressures in the middle third (260). His work rate has been a real asset to Bournemouth as they look to profit from their on-field proactivity. When analysing the Cherries’ pressing habits, it might be tempting to zone in on their 166 high turnovers putting them only mid-table in the rankings for that metric, but a lot of their hard work off the ball happens in the middle third. For instance, their 14.7 pressed sequences per game is bettered by only three teams in the Premier League, while it’s also worth highlighting their efficiency with high turnovers; 3.6% of their 166 have led to a goal (six), the joint-best record in the division. Working hard in this manner isn’t new to Bournemouth or Solanke. Last season, he tallied more pressures (1,134) than any other player in the Premier League, but one manager’s pressing plan isn’t the same as the next manager’s; the targets, triggers and even the desired outcome could be entirely different, and clearly there’s been a change with Solanke. In 2022-23, only 35.8% of his pressures were confined to the final third; 13.8% of them occurred in Bournemouth’s own defensive third, meaning a little over half (50.4%) were recorded in the middle third. This season, however, Solanke’s pressing has been far more localised to the final third (49.1%), where the biggest proportion of his pressures have taken place, with just 6.6% occurring in Bournemouth’s defensive third and 44.3% in the middle. It’s easy to see why then that Solanke feels Iraola’s approach to pressing has been fundamental in his own broader improvement. He’s still doing much of the same work as before, just higher up the pitch, providing him with more responsibility – and action – in the areas a striker wants to be in.  As such, the proportion of Solanke’s shots taking place in the penalty area are up from 86.6% last term to 90.9% this season, while his touches in the opposition’s box are up to 6.8 per 90 from 5.6. This all feeds back into his overall improvement in front of goal, which is arguably best summed up by the fact his goals account for 42.9% of Bournemouth’s Premier League total this term; only five players in the top five European leagues have scored a greater proportion of their team’s goals than Solanke in 2023-24. So, is it any wonder that teams like Arsenal and Newcastle – sides who are renowned for their work rate off the ball – have been so strongly linked with Solanke? Sure, there’ll be some tempering their excitement for a little while longer, waiting to see how long he sustains this form because, as we’ve highlighted, the improvement is dramatic in many respects. Is this simply a flash in the pan or is Solanke finally maintaining the level many expected him to reach when he was younger? Although that’s impossible to answer at the moment, the signs are clearly positive and Sunday’s visit of Liverpool is the perfect opportunity for him to make a few more people sit up and take note. Sometimes a player just needs the right manager and the right time; it feels like the stars have finally aligned for Solanke, with Iraola’s arrival potentially the making of him. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to Saturday’s late kick-off in the Premier League with our Brentford vs Nottingham Forest prediction and preview. It’s fair to say Brentford have missed Ivan Toney during the striker’s eight-month ban for breaching the Football Association’s gambling rules. The Bees head into Saturday’s clash with Nottingham Forest just three points clear of the Premier League’s relegation zone and on a miserable run of form that’s seen them go seven games without a win in all competitions. As Toney returns to the fray, can he inspire an upturn against another side glancing nervously over their shoulders? Brentford have lost seven of their last eight Premier League games (one win), including each of their last five, having squandered an early lead in a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last time out in the competition on 30 December. They last endured a longer losing run in league action as a second-tier side in March 1993, while only in April 1947 have they had a longer such streak in the top flight (seven). Thomas Frank’s side suffered more frustration in the third round of the FA Cup in midweek, being beaten 3-2 by Wolves in a dramatic replay at Molineux that required extra time. Brentford twice led through Nathan Collins and Neal Maupay, but goals from Nélson Semedo, Nathan Fraser and Matheus Cunha sent Gary O’Neil’s men through. Frank will hope the return of Toney – who is expected to stay at the Gtech Community Stadium after being linked with Arsenal and Chelsea – can make the difference for his embattled side. Only Erling Haaland (36) and Harry Kane (30) bettered Toney’s 20 Premier League goals last season, as he scored 17 of his 33 big chances for a 51.5% conversion rate. The England international has an excellent record against Forest, netting in all three of his previous league games against them, while he has also scored on his last three home league outings. His return is even more welcome given Brentford’s selection problems. Fellow attackers Bryan Mbeumo and Kevin Schade are sidelined, while Yoane Wissa is representing DR Congo at the Africa Cup of Nations. Frank Onyeka is also at that tournament with Nigeria while Iran’s Saman Ghoddos is at the Asian Cup, but defenders Kristoffer Ajer and Ben Mee returned from injury and suspension in midweek and should feature in Saturday’s lineup. If Brentford are to drag themselves clear of the bottom three, they simply must improve their game management; they have dropped a Premier League-high 20 points from winning positions this season, losing the most games after scoring first in the competition (four). Meanwhile, they are one of six teams yet to fight back to win after conceding first in 2023-24. Forest’s problems, meanwhile, are predominantly of an off-pitch nature, with Nuno Espírito Santo’s positive start at the City Ground in danger of being undone by Monday’s charge for an alleged breach of the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules. Forest won’t discover their punishment – if found guilty – until April, but a 10-point deduction identical to that received by Everton in November would, at present, plunge them to 19th in the table. On the pitch, Nuno has overseen a clear upturn since taking the reins from Steve Cooper. Having won their last two Premier League games against Newcastle United (3-1) and Manchester United (2-1), Forest could post three straight wins in the competition for the first time since May 1999. Forest were also in FA Cup action in midweek, as they won their replay at Blackpool on Wednesday night 3-2 thanks to goals from Andrew Omobamidele, Danilo and an extra-time strike from Chris Wood. Morgan Gibbs-White hit a superb winner against Man Utd in Forest’s last league game, having been teed up by in-form wideman Anthony Elanga. With four goals and six assists, Elanga has been involved in 42% of Forest’s 24 Premier League goals this season, a higher share than all but three players in the competition. Three of Elanga’s assists have come at the end of carries, with only Ollie Watkins (five), Anthony Gordon, Jérémy Doku and Mohamed Salah (four apiece) registering more in the competition. Forest will certainly hope to pose a physical threat, with only Arsenal (nine) bettering their eight headed goals in the Premier League in 2023-24 – those efforts account for a league-high 33% of their overall tally. Brentford, meanwhile, have conceded a competition-high 10 headed goals this term. Forest’s leading scorer Wood has netted three of his seven Premier League goals this term with his head, and he will lead the line once more on Saturday with Taiwo Awoniyi still absent. The omens are good for Brentford ahead of this meeting of potential strugglers. The Bees are unbeaten in their last five league meetings with Forest, winning two and drawing three against them since suffering a 1-0 home defeat in the Championship in January 2020. However, October’s return fixture was one of many games in which they have squandered a lead this campaign, with Nicolás Domínguez cancelling out Christian Nørgaard’s opener despite Forest having defender Moussa Niakhaté sent off early in the second half. Forest lost this exact fixture 2-1 last April, with late goals from Toney and Josh Dasilva completing a remarkable turnaround after Danilo had put the visitors in front. They could now lose on successive league trips to Brentford for just the second time, previously doing so in April 1949 and August 2016. Having won their most recent away league game at Newcastle on Boxing Day, Forest could record back-to-back road wins in the top flight for the first time since April 1995, when they won four straight under Frank Clark. However, they have a dismal recent record in London. Since returning to the Premier League in 2022, Forest have shipped 29 goals in 12 away league matches against London clubs, at an average of 2.4 per game. They were hammered 5-0 at Fulham on their last trip to the capital. Brentford, meanwhile, have witnessed an alarming drop-off in their home form this term. They lost two of 19 home league games in 2022-23 (10 wins, seven draws), with only Manchester City, United and Liverpool (all one) suffering fewer defeats on their own turf. They have already doubled that tally in 2023-24, losing four of their 10 league matches at the Gtech Community Stadium (three wins, three draws) including their last two, against Aston Villa (2-1) and Wolves (4-1).

We look ahead to it with our Algeria vs Burkina Faso prediction and preview. Algeria will be looking to end a run of four AFCON games without a win when they take on Burkina Faso this weekend. Since winning the 2019 final against Senegal, the two-time Champions have drawn two and lost two of their subsequent four games, last enduring a longer winless run between the 2010 and 2013 editions (five games).  Despite being pre-match favourites in their opening group game against Angola, the Fennec Foxes were held to a 1-1 draw, with Baghdad Bounedjah’s opening goal cancelled out by Mabululu’s second-half penalty. Djamel Belmadi’s side enjoyed the lion’s share of possession, completing 442 passes – their joint-most in an AFCON game since Opta has recorded passing data (2010) – but could only convert that into chances worth 0.86 expected goals, and Angola forced them to shoot from range. Previous history doesn’t bode well for Algeria’s chances of progression. They’ve been eliminated at the group stage on the last three instances they’ve failed to win their opening match at the Africa Cup of Nations (2013, 2017, 2022). Burkina Faso left it very, very late against Mauritania on MD 1, but Bertrand Traoré’s 96th-minute penalty eventually won the contest. The victory saw Burkina Faso win their opening match of an Africa Cup of Nations edition for the very first time, drawing five times and losing on seven occasions in their previous 12 attempts. Like their opponents on Saturday, Burkina Faso dominated the ball. With 62.1% possession in their win over Mauritania, they recorded their highest average possession figure in a Africa Cup of Nations match on record. Yet they didn’t really threaten with it, and required a VAR intervention to help award them their winning penalty.  This will be the third meeting between Algeria and Burkina Faso in the Africa Cup of Nations. Each encounter has taken place in the group stage. They have one 2-1 victory each, with Algeria winning in 1996, and Burkina Faso returning the favour in 1998. The two sides last met in qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Drawn together in Group A, the teams drew both of their meetings, with Algeria eventually advancing.  The Opta supercomputer makes Algeria the favourites for this tie, giving them a 54.0% of taking all three points. Burkina Faso are given a 23.5% chance of causing an upset, while the draw is an outside shout at 22.5%.  In our overall tournament predictions, these two sides are our favourites to progress from Group D: Algeria: Moustapha Zeghba, Anthony Mandréa, Oussama Benbot, Raïs M’Bolhi, Aïssa Mandi, Ahmed Touba, Rayan Aït-Nouri, Mohamed Amine Tougaï, Ramy Bensebaïni, Zinéddine Belaïd, Yasser Larouci, Kévin Van Den Kerkhof, Youcef Atal, Hicham Boudaoui, Nabil Bentaleb, Youcef Belaïli, Sofiane Féghouli, Adam Ounas, Ismaël Bennacer, Houssem Aouar, Ramiz Zerrouki, Farès Chaïbi, Riyad Mahrez, Baghdad Bounedjah, Mohammed Amoura, Islam Slimani.\\xa0 Coach: Djamel Belmadi\\xa0 Burkina Faso: Hervé Koffi, Hillel Konaté, Kilian Nikièma, Sébastien Tou, Edmond Tapsoba, Steeve Yago, Issoufou Dayo, Valentin Nouma, Abdoul Guiébré, Adamo Nagalo, Nasser Djiga, Issa Kaboré, Blati Touré, Bertrand Traoré, Gustavo Sangaré, Sacha Bansé, Mamady Bangré, Cédric Badolo, Ismahila Ouédraogo, Dramane Salou, Adama Guira, Djibril Ouattara, Mohamed Konaté, Abdoul Tapsoba, Aziz Ki, Hassane Bandé, Dango Ouattara.\\xa0 Coach: Hubert Velud\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Tunisia and Mali, the two teams that had been tipped to dominate Group E, meet in Saturday’s headline clash at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations having endured strikingly different starts to the tournament. While Mali saw off South Africa with a 2-0 win to go top of the group, Tunisia slipped to a disappointing defeat to Namibia that left their hopes of making the second round in doubt. In that game, they dominated possession but couldn’t turn that into good chances, generating just 0.69 xG from their 10 shots, despite seeing 61% of the ball. It was Namibia’s first-ever win at the Africa Cup of Nations. Jalel Kadri’s side must now win at least one of their remaining two games, having arguably already faced their weakest opponents. They have tended to do well on Matchday 2 at the AFCON, though, winning seven of their 10 such games in the group stage. They have never lost their first two games of an AFCON tournament. However, they have also never beaten Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations, drawing one and losing two of their meetings – all of which came in the group stage. Should they fail to win again here, Mali will become the opponent they have faced the joint-most times in the AFCON group stage without ever having beaten them (also Ghana and Senegal – both four meetings). Mali, meanwhile, recorded a convincing win over South Africa in their opening game of the tournament. They missed a few chances themselves but were let off by profligate opponents. South Africa’s Percy Tau put a 19th-minute penalty over the bar, before missing another big chance 10 minutes later. It then took Mali until the hour mark to find a way through their opponents, with Hamari Traoré breaking the deadlock, before key man Lassine Sinayoko, who topped the charts for open-play shot-ending sequence involvements in the game (see the below graphic), added a second goal. The result meant Mali have now kept a clean sheet in three consecutive AFCON games, and given the three AFCON meetings between these teams have produced just three goals, don’t expect this one to be a goal fest. These sides have met three times previously at the Africa Cup of Nations, with all three of those games – like this one – coming in the group stage. Mali have got the better of Tunisia in those matches, winning two and losing none of them. Mali won the most recent of those matches, coming out 1-0 victors in the 2022 edition. However, the teams have met twice since that AFCON game – in a two-legged World Cup qualifying playoff – with Tunisia winning 1-0 on aggregate. Those games followed a trend of low-scoring games between the sides. Their three AFCON matches have produced a total of just three goals. Despite their shock defeat to Namibia, Tunisia are deemed favourites to win this crucial AFCON clash, with the Opta supercomputer giving them a 44.6% chance of victory compared to 29.9% for Mali.  Our pre-tournament predictions made Tunisia favourites to top Group E, but they will need two huge performances in their next two games to manage that now unlikely feat. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Tunisia: Mouez Hassen, Béchir Ben Saïd, Aymen Dahmen, Wajdi Kechrida, Yassine Meriah, Oussama Haddadi, Montassar Talbi, Ali Maâloul, Ali Abdi, Yan Valery, Hamza Jelassi, Naïm Sliti, Ellyes Skhiri, Bassem Srarfi, Sayfallah Ltaief, Hadj Mahmoud, Aïssa Laïdouni, Mohamed Ben Romdhane, Alaa Ghram, Houssem Tka, Hamza Rafia, Anis Ben Slimane, Youssef Msakni, Taha Khenissi, Elias Achouri, Haythem Jouini, Seifeddine Jaziri.

Few will have this Group D clash at Stade de la Paix down as a likely goal-fest. Mauritania and Angola do not exactly have a great history of finding the net at the Africa Cup of Nations. Their only previous AFCON meeting was at the 2019 tournament, which finished 0-0 and featured just one shot on target (from Angola). Mauritania have not scored in their last six AFCON outings, last registering a goal with a penalty from Moctar El Hacen against Mali in 2019. They have had 68 shots since then without scoring, with just seven of those efforts on target. They suffered late heartbreak in their opening game of the 2023 tournament against Burkina Faso, conceding a 96th-minute penalty to Bertrand Traoré in a 1-0 defeat. Captain Aly Abeid will again be key for them against Angola, though. He was top for both successful passes (21) and chances created (3) for Mauritania in their loss to Burkina Faso, and was the first Mauritanian player to create three chances in an Africa Cup of Nations match. Angola aren’t much better in front of goal, scoring just seven goals in their last 10 group-stage games at the AFCON since the 2010 edition. They did find the net in their first game, though, with Mabululu scoring from the penalty spot as Angola earned an impressive point in a 1-1 draw with Algeria. Baghdad Bounedjah had put the 2019 AFCON champions ahead but a resilient Angola fought back to draw. As mentioned, Mauritania and Angola’s only previous encounter at the Africa Cup of Nations was in the group stage of the 2019 edition and ended goalless. Angola had the only shot on target, making it the lowest total of shots on target in a single game over the last three tournaments. They also drew 0-0 last January at the African Nations Championship. Angola have not beaten Mauritania in their last three meetings in all competitions (D2 L1), failing to score a single goal against the Lions of Chinguetti since a 4-1 win in AFCON 2019 qualifying. Perhaps because 0-0 seems to be such a likely score here, the Opta supercomputer has struggled to separate the two. Perhaps Angola’s impressive draw against Algeria is why they have been slightly favoured, with a 37% chance of victory. Mauritania are given a 36% likelihood of winning, leaving a 27% chance of a draw.  Our pre-tournament predictions gave both a just over 50% chance of advancing to the last 16, but Mauritania’s percentage almost halved after their agonising late loss to Burkina Faso.

We looked at their dramatic decline and what they’re doing in their attempts to climb away from trouble. There was a time – quite a long time in fact – quite recently when Sevilla were up there with the best-run clubs in Europe. They were the masters of buying cheap, maximising players’ abilities and selling for significant profit, or cutting out the buying part altogether and promoting from their brilliant academy, which has been a major source of income over the past two decades. This brought on-pitch success as well, but the man behind much of that is gone, with sporting director Monchi moving to Aston Villa last summer after bringing his second spell at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán to an end. He left behind an old, underperforming and expensive (in terms of wages) squad; the outlook is now far bleaker than it was just 18 months ago, with genuine fear setting in regarding the possibility of relegation. After last Friday’s 3-2 home defeat to Alavés, Sevilla ended Matchday 20 just a point above the bottom three. They’ve managed as many La Liga wins this season as they’ve had head coaches (three) and lost more games (10) than all but three other clubs in the division. Their points tally of 16 is their joint-third worst at this stage of a La Liga campaign (counting three points per win) – the last time they had 16 or fewer from their first 20 matches was in 1967-68 (13), when they were relegated.  Furthermore, since the start of the 2012-13 season, only eight clubs (excluding 2023-24) have had exactly 16 points after 20 games – and five of them went down. Sevilla are fortunate there have been three teams worse than them this season – two of them considerably so – with Granada (11 points) and winless Almería (six points) already looking doomed. Nevertheless, relegated in 16.5% of the Opta supercomputer’s latest 10,000 simulations at the time of writing, Sevilla’s position is hardly one of strength. So, that’s the situation they find themselves in.  The question is, how? It essentially began with Monchi’s return to Sevilla in 2019 after a brief and unsuccessful spell with Roma. His plan was to turn Sevilla into genuine title challengers, so although there was still a desire for some players with re-sale value, they set their limits a little higher. Their ambition also saw them turn to more players about to hit their peak years or those who boasted significant experience. Maximum short-term impact rather than long-term investment was the idea in many cases, with players like Fernando, Luuk de Jong, Ivan Rakitic, Papu Gómez, Marcos Acuña, Thomas Delaney, Jesús Corona, Anthony Martial, Alex Telles, Isco and Érik Lamela brought in between 2019 and 2022. A few made decent contributions, a couple delivered great value, but most would be considered mistakes or disappointments. The excellence of Julen Lopetegui and the brilliant defence he had for three seasons arguably made Sevilla look better than the sum of their parts as they finished in the top four three years in a row for the first time since the 1950s, having a very good stab at challenging for the title in the process. In 2020-21, they pushed the big boys hard and then looked like Real Madrid’s only credible threat in the first half of 2021-22. In Jules Koundé and Diego Carlos, they had one of the best centre-back partnerships in Europe in front of the dependable Yassine Bounou; not only were they fundamental to how the team played out from the back, but the solidity they helped establish meant Sevilla didn’t need to be a free-scoring side. For instance, from August 2019 to June 2022, 32 teams across the top five leagues scored more than Sevilla (160 – 53.3 per season), but of all the clubs to spend more than one year in those competitions in that period, only Real Madrid (84), Paris Saint-Germain (88), Manchester City (93) and Atlético Madrid (95) conceded fewer than Lopetegui’s men (97). Similarly, City (57) and Madrid (52) were the two teams to keep more clean sheets than Sevilla (51) over those three seasons. They knew Koundé and Diego Carlos would leave eventually and the chances of replacing either with a centre-back of a similar level but much cheaper were small; the likelihood of doing so for both in the same summer was remote, so when those two departed in the pre-season of 2022, the team crumbled. Sevilla lost the foundation around which their whole team was built, and so their brief flirtation with title challenges was firmly over. As their attacking numbers suggested, especially in the second half of 2021-22 when their title tilt quickly wilted, they needed to offset the decrease in their defensive solidity by improving their quality going forward; Kasper Dolberg joined on a loan deal that was terminated at the end of December 2022 after failing to score a single goal, Isco signed but had his contract terminated before Christmas following a row with Monchi, and Adnan Januzaj made one La Liga start before being loaned to Istanbul Basaksehir in January 2023 and Sevilla are still reportedly trying to get him off the books. He continues to await his first goal. In terms of attacking reinforcements, that was it, and the rolling expected goals (xG) average chart below highlights how rarely since the start of last season that their attacking threat has outweighed their defensive deficiencies. Hindsight is 20/20, sure, but none of those players made an adequate impression, so Lopetegui was fighting a losing battle from the start of the 2022-23 season. The team’s issues were compounded by the struggles of the centre-backs brought in to replace Koundé and Diego Carlos. Tanguy Nianzou largely looked out of his depth last term, to the extent that he’s only played three times in La Liga this season; Marcão has managed just eight league appearances in total due to almost constant injury problems. The upheaval culminated in a dreadful start to 2022-23 that saw Lopetegui sacked after one win in their first 10 games across all competitions. Jorge Sampaoli replaced him for his second spell at the club but they never got much better, with murmurings of player discontent regarding the complicated nature of his tactical instructions. He was sacked in March 2023 with Sevilla just two points above the relegation zone. It was verging on miraculous that Sampaoli’s replacement, proverbial firefighter José Luis Mendilibar, steered them comfortably clear of the bottom three and guided Sevilla to their record-extending seventh UEFA Cup/Europa League title. Given where they are now, it remains utterly mystifying. Of course, Mendilibar didn’t last long either. His direct, back-to-basics football quickly wore thin and, considering he was the pick of Monchi, it wasn’t particularly surprising to see new sporting director Victor Orta – whose spell at Leeds United ultimately left a bad taste for fans – bring in a manager of his own.  However, it begged the question as to why they didn’t part with Mendilibar – who was never likely to be a long-term fit regardless of Europa League success – in the summer at the end of his short-term contract when they’d apparently lined up the highly rated Marcelo Gallardo to take over. As harsh as it sounds on Mendilibar, it would’ve been a clean break, an opportunity to start a new era afresh. When Mendilibar was dismissed in September after only two wins from their first 11 games in all competitions, Gallardo had already gone to Saudi Arabia. Orta plumped for Diego Alonso, which always looked a curious decision. His last club job had been an unimpressive stint with Inter Miami, then he failed to get Uruguay out of their group at the 2022 World Cup. It was also seemingly a bone of contention between the board and sporting director at the time, with president Pepe Castro and vice-president José María del Nido Carrasco filmed at the training ground appearing to share their misgivings with Orta. Their concern, and that of the fans, was justified. Sevilla’s commitment to playing predictable cross-and-hope football due to a dearth of creative options in the centre of the pitch got even greater, with them now the only club in La Liga this season to see less than 20% of their chances created come from the middle third (19.5%). Funnily enough, it isn’t a strategy that’s yielded lots of positive results. Alonso didn’t win a single La Liga game during his time in charge, becoming only the second coach in the club’s history to record no victories in his first eight top-flight games as boss. He also became only the second coach in La Liga history to draw his first four La Liga matches. Suffice to say, there was no ‘new manager bounce’. Quique Sánchez Flores was next in the door; another uninspiring choice for many, but their options were limited and at least he could boast considerable experience coaching in Spain. And that brings us to January 2024, with Sevilla travelling to league leaders Girona on Sunday just a point above Cádiz in the last relegation place. At this stage, not even the most arrogant of supporters would suggest they’re not in a fight for survival, with a first relegation in 24 years looking concerningly possible. Of all ever-present La Liga clubs since the start of 2022-23, only Almería (47), Cádiz (57) and Celta Vigo (60) have won fewer points than Sevilla (65). As such, they’ve plummeted in the Opta Power Rankings, going from 14th in July 2022 to 74th this week. The situation has forced them to revert to some of the recruitment principles that helped shape what has been a golden era for the club over the past two decades. The players Orta – who worked under Monchi for seven years from 2006 – has turned to this month are young, and one of them is from the academy. Isaac Romero had to be patient in stepping up from the second team, Sevilla Atlético. A serious injury stopped him in his tracks during the 2021-22 season, but the striker showed signs of promise last term and scored 11 goals in 15 games for Sevilla Atlético before the turn of the year. Fans had been calling for the 23-year-old to be brought into the first team for months, but registration rules meant that was only possible in January if a member of the senior squad left. Fernando, 36, brought his fine spell at the club to an end and returned to Brazil, allowing the homegrown forward to step up; his decisive brace in Tuesday’s 3-1 Copa del Rey defeat of Getafe nudged Rafa Mir closer to the exit. The players Orta has signed this month have all been even younger than Isaac. Lucien Agoumé (21, loan with option to buy), Mateo Mejía (20), Stanis Idumbo Muzambo (18) and Hannibal Mejbri (20, loan with option to buy). In one sense it’s refreshing because Sevilla have needed an injection of youthful exuberance for a few years. Their starting XI in November’s 3-2 defeat to PSV had an average age of 32 years and 19 days, making it the oldest line-up in Champions League history, and they’ve also named the oldest team in La Liga this term (31y, 127d vs Valencia). But Orta turning to youth appears to be more out of necessity than design. The senior side has little room for manoeuvre in terms of their salary limit, and they’ve no space to register players because they’re struggling to offload the likes of Joan Jordán, Lamela, Óliver Torres, Januzaj, Mariano Díaz and Mir, meaning all of their new young recruits have instead been registered with the B team. They can still play for the senior side because they’re all under the age of 23, but the situation is far from ideal particularly given they had to terminate the contract of homegrown goalkeeper Alfonso Pastor to make room for Hannibal’s wages in Sevilla Atlético’s budget. There’s clearly a potential upside to going for younger talents, but it also stinks of poor planning and desperation; after all, if the club’s idea all along was to introduce significantly more young players then Sevilla probably wouldn’t have allowed Carlos Alvárez, their most talented youth product in over a decade, to join Levante for free (plus 50% of his next transfer fee) in the summer. So, unless there are some major outgoings that facilitate more movements in the last two weeks of the January transfer window, the new faces Sevilla are hoping can be the difference between relegation and safety are a handful of young players. Talented young players, granted, but largely inexperienced and unproven, with Mejía and Idumbo set to start off with the B team. Perhaps it’s the beginning of a return to their roots, all part of a necessary cultural reset that sees them back at Spanish football’s top table in a few years. Either way, right now it feels like the road back will be far, far longer than the shortcut they took from title challengers to relegation battlers. Enjoy this?

But to do that, they still need to improve in certain respects. When Rocco Commisso acquired Fiorentina in June 2019, his great ambitions clashed with a club that, after a few good seasons under Vincenzo Montella and Paulo Sousa, was struggling to improve on lower-mid-table positions. The 2018-19 season ended for the Viola with a disappointing 16th place and with relegation avoided only on the final day. In the first two seasons, the adaptation of the new ownership to a new reality like that of Italian Calcio was not easy. Managerial changes (going from Montella to Giuseppe Iachini, up to trying to recall Cesare Prandelli, who had a glorious past with the club between 2005 and 2010) did not lead to great results. Fiorentina achieved a 10th-place finish in Serie A in 2019-20 and 13th in the following campaign. After this settling in period, the turning point came when the ownership decided to radically change the team’s style of play, bringing in Vincenzo Italiano as manager – who had impressed at the helm of Spezia in the previous two seasons. It was clear to everyone right from his appointment that the desired results would not immediately arrive, and that management and supporters would have to wait for Italiano to get his ideas across to his squad. But the new style of play was noticeable from the very first games. It took a while to start reaping the benefits, though. Fiorentina ended the 2021-2022 campaign in seventh place, followed by eighth place last season – though they were also runners-up in both the UEFA Europa Conference League and Coppa Italia. They also had the bonus of qualifying again for the Europa Conference League due to Juventus’ year-long ban from UEFA competitions. This season they’re performing even better. After 19 matchdays, they had 10 points more than the same stage in 2022-23 (the second-best point difference after the first half of the campaign between last season and this season behind Inter – who had 11 points more). They have also made it to the Coppa Italia semi-finals and finished top of their group in the UECL group stage. As mentioned, the style of play brought by Italiano was evident from the start of his reign. The main characteristic is lots of ball possession, especially in the opponent’s half. In each of the last three Serie A seasons, Fiorentina have recorded the second-highest possession percentage (always behind Napoli) and in two of these campaigns have had the highest field tilt value (68.0% in 2021-22 and 69.7% this season), which is a measure of territorial dominance between teams. It looks at the share of possession each team has in their attacking third compared to their opponent. So far at Fiorentina, Italiano has alternated between a 4-3-3 formation and a 4-2-3-1. His team really utilises the flanks, using their full-backs a lot in the build-up. Cristiano Biraghi, captain and left-back, has been involved in the most open-play sequences (799) for Fiorentina so far this season, 118 more than his nearest teammate, Brazilian midfielder Arthur. Another characteristic of Italiano’s Fiorentina is their high aggression – with a defensive line always kept very high – and over the seasons this has become much more evident. Looking at PPDA (opposition passes per defensive action) and their high turnovers per game, it is clear that with the passage of time and the chance to learn Italiano’s football, Fiorentina’s defensive phase and pressing have become much more aggressive. In fact, they have improved in pressing, becoming the Serie A side with the lowest PPDA (10.3) and most high turnovers per game (9.0). However, despite the impressive number of high turnovers so far (180 after 20 league games), only 24 of these have ended in a shot – and just two have ended in a goal. To make a definitive leap in quality, Fiorentina must improve two aspects; one offensive and one defensive. The offensive one can also be traced back to the data on high turnovers and field tilt. Although the Tuscans play a lot of their football in the attacking third, they are not great at creating good goalscoring opportunities. Fiorentina have had the third-most touches in the opposition box this season in Serie A (on average 25.2 per game) and have attempted the third-most open play crosses (15.4 per game). However, the average expected goals (xG) value of their shots is 0.09 – 14th in this ranking among Serie A sides in 2023-24. In fact, because of their long periods of possession in attacking zones, they often struggle to find space between the opponents’ defensive lines, with 39% of their shots coming from outside the box, the highest percentage among sides in the top half of Serie A, which explains why the xG average value of their attempts is so low. Indeed, only one of their 104 shots from outside the box has led to a goal. Since Dusan Vlahovic left the club to join Juventus in January 2022, Fiorentina have not yet found a striker able to score double figures in a single Serie A campaign. Their joint-top scorers in the current season are midfielder Giacomo Bonaventura and winger Nicolás González, both on six goals. Bonaventura’s performances have been a big bonus as the 34-year-old is experiencing a second wind in his career and is having one of his best seasons ever. With six goals scored and two assisted in 18 Serie A appearances (1,416 minutes), the former Milan man has been directly involved in a goal every 177 minutes – his third-best ratio in a Serie A season over his 20+ year career. For the role of central striker, after the departures of Arthur Cabral and Luka Jović, Fiorentina have gambled on Lucas Beltrán and M’Bala Nzola, but neither seems ready for the role of attacking leader. Beltrán, bought from River Plate last summer, needed 12 league appearances to find his first Serie A goal. Now, he seems to be more confident and has grown a lot in recent times, having found the net in four of his last six league games (one from the penalty spot). Fiorentina have won five points thanks to his last three goals – but the Argentinian still has a few steps to make to become central in Fiorentina’s project. On the defensive side, even though they have faced only 203 shots so far (just four fewer than the best team in this ranking, Inter – 199), because they keep the ball so well the chances they concede are often quite dangerous. The average xG per shot they have faced so far is 0.13, the highest in Serie A this season. This is clearly because of their high pressing and their high defensive line, an aggressive attitude that leaves space for the opposition’s attacking players to exploit. Of shots attempted by their opponents this season, 72.9% have come from inside the box; the highest percentage in Serie A. Furthermore, the graphic below shows how high Fiorentina’s defensive line is; their average offside line is 32.4m, the highest in the league this season. So, on to the question about whether Fiorentina can qualify for the Champions League this season… They currently sit fourth in Serie A after 20 games, a point ahead of Atalanta and Lazio. According to our prediction model, Fiorentina have slightly greater than a 20% chance of finishing in the top four in Serie A (though there is still a chance for Italy to have five spots due to changes in qualifying for next season’s Champions League). That suggests they only have a one-in-five chance unless fifth place also counts, but it’s far from impossible. With their high-risk, high-reward approach, you would be a brave person to rule Italiano’s men out. Even if it doesn’t happen, they have still started on the path to build a glorious future in the coming years. Enjoy this?

Now, eight months later, they are on the verge of achieving a club record unbeaten league run. We look at the data behind Russell Martin’s success since arriving at Saints. It was a tough watch for Southampton fans last season. After 11 years as a Premier League club, Saints fell back into the second tier for the first time since 2012, and along the way their supporters witnessed more defeats in 2022-23 than in any other competitive season in their history (28). After sacking Ralph Hasenhüttl – who’d taken charge of more games at the club than any other coach since the early 1990s – in November of last season, they gambled in appointing Nathan Jones from Luton Town. The gamble failed, and he lasted just 14 games in all competitions. Realising that their Premier League survival chances were low, they gave the job on a temporary basis to Rubén Sellés, who arguably led the side through an even more disastrous spell. At first glance, Russell Martin’s two seasons at Swansea City hardly set the world alight, just like his two seasons beforehand in Milton Keynes. After two mid-table finishes with MK Dons in League One, Martin led the Welsh club to 15th place in his first Championship season, and while they improved their league position in his second campaign (10th), they only won five more points. However, with Martin taking over after Swansea’s Premier League parachute money dried up, three seasons after their drop from the top flight, his job was to stabilise and build a team to challenge the top of the league three or four years down the line. Just like at MK Dons, he was halfway through that project before Southampton came knocking this summer. Southampton started the season under Martin well on paper, with three wins and a draw across their opening four fixtures. However, two of those wins came via goals in the final minutes of the match, while their 4-4 draw with Norwich City on 12 August also saw a point gained via Adam Armstrong’s injury-time penalty. Then came the downfall. Four successive Championship defeats in a row, which began with thrashings by Sunderland (5-0) and Leicester City (4-1) and was followed by one-goal defeats to Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough. Some fans began to question the appointment of Martin after their relegation back to the Championship. Following criticism after the defeat to Middlesbrough, the former defender bit back. “The club had a huge disappointment last season and has embarked on a different journey,” Martin said. “When you are trying to do something completely different, it is never easy. It is time for everyone to be really brave, stick together and get through it together. Or you don’t, and that’s football.” Luckily for those fans, and Southampton, they did stick together. It’s not the first time that Martin’s passionately defended his playing style, either: Love this from MK Dons boss Russell Martin. pic.twitter.com/xJKdhvS4yJ At the time of writing, Southampton’s loss to Middlesbrough on 23 September was their last in all competitions. Since the end of that matchday onwards, Southampton have won more points than anyone else in the Championship. Their 45 points is one more than league leaders Leicester (44) and, more importantly in the battle for automatic promotion, eight more than Ipswich (37). They’ve also had the best defence in that 19-game period (12 goals conceded) and are the only unbeaten side in England’s top four tiers since then – both in the league (19 games) and across all competitions (20 games). Last Saturday’s 4-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday equalled their club-record unbeaten league run of 19 games, set back in 1921, while it also equalled their unbeaten record of 20 competitive games set in January 1922. A trip to Martin’s former side Swansea on Saturday offers them the chance to create history. Southampton’s mixed start to the season can be arguably attributed to the amount of squad upheaval in August that the recently relegated side had to deal with. While outgoings were expected, Southampton’s opening game of the season at Sheffield Wednesday saw James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Tella start, while Lyanco, Moussa Djenepo and Roméo Lavia were all named on the bench. All five of those players were gone by the time the summer transfer window shut four weeks later. Once those players were offloaded, Southampton were able to bring in players that Martin could use in his possession-heavy style – one that undoubtedly requires months of training-ground work to implement in a squad not used to keeping the ball from their opponents as long as Martin’s preferred methods necessitate. Since the transfer window closed, two of his August incomings – central defender Taylor Harwood-Bellis and midfielder Flynn Downes, on loan from Manchester City and West Ham respectively – are among the top five Southampton players for Championship minutes played. Both are comfortable in possession and integral to Martin’s methodical football and rank among the top Championship players for successful passes per 90 minutes. In fact, across the 2023-24 Championship campaign, five of the top 14 players to have averaged 70 successful passes per 90 minutes or higher (of those to play at least 1,000 mins) play for Southampton – the top seven contains both Harwood-Bellis (86.6) and Downes (76.3), as well as Jan Bednarek (94.4). It’s no secret that Martin likes his team to have a lot of the ball. Constant ball circulation means that choreographed patterns of play in the attacking half are set up. His defenders see a lot of the ball to try and coax the opposition to press higher up the pitch and get dragged out of shape, before his midfielders and forwards exploit the space left by stranded opponents. That style also makes the goalkeeper a vital part of building possession out from the back. Gavin Bazunu had a difficult first season at Southampton last year and there were doubts among Southampton fans that he was good enough to be their number one. Those doubts hardly lifted after their mixed start to the season, but still only 21 years old, the young Irishman definitely has a high ceiling. Bazunu has been involved in the build-up for seven goals in the Championship this season – more than any other goalkeeper –  while his build-up involvement in 42 shots is second to only Leicester’s Mads Hermansen (49). So far this season, he’s averaged 30.4 successful passes per 90 minutes – that’s up from 18 successful passes per 90 on average last season in the Premier League. Martin’s arrival at the club has seen Bazunu have to become much more comfortable with the ball at his feet, and across 2023-24 he’s gradually managed to do just that. With an average of 5.2 passes per open-play sequence this season, Southampton’s passing sequences contain more passes on average than any other side. What’s more, it’s the highest average seen in a Championship season on record (since 2016-17), while their average number of open-play passing sequences consisting of at least 10 passes (22 per game) is also the highest since then, ahead of Leicester this season (21.2) and Swansea last season under Martin (18.2). When they lose the ball, they work hard to win it back quickly, too. No Championship side this season have a lower PPDA than Saints’ 10.0, which essentially shows that no side is more efficient at allowing opposition sides fewer passes on average before winning possession back.  They also rank second for how high up the pitch they start their sequences (44.1 metres from their own goal), behind only Leeds (44.7m), and they rank third for high turnovers (227) behind Leeds (248) and Ipswich (234). In more basic terms, if Southampton lose the ball, they win it back quicker than any other team and do so high up the pitch, putting pressure back on their opponents. Martin’s Swansea sides were always pretty on the eye, but often criticised for not converting that into attacking pressure. The same can’t really be said of Southampton this season, who have averaged the most touches in the opposition box (34.9), most shots (15.7) and second highest non-penalty expected goals per game (1.64 – although only 0.01 below Leeds) in the league. That xG per game average is 0.34 higher than Swansea last season and 0.60 higher than in Martin’s first season there. Evidently, Southampton don’t just keep possession for the sake of playing pretty football.  Their field tilt numbers this season are one more metric that emphasise this. Field tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. It measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter. No team have a higher field tilt in the Championship this season than Saints (72.1%), which is over 10 percentage points higher than the next most in the competition – Leicester’s 61.8%. It’s not like Southampton have been chasing games, either – only Leicester (9% losing, 47% winning) have spent a longer proportion of match time in a winning position and a shorter proportion losing than Martin’s side in 2023-24 (15% losing, 41% winning). It’s fair to say that Southampton’s start under Martin has gone under the radar because of how well Leicester and Ipswich have done in 2023-24 so far. Their 55 points from 27 games is only four fewer than 2022-23 title-winners Burnley had won at this stage (59), while only 15 teams in the 29 second-tier seasons between 1993-94 and 2022-23 have performed better. In fact, since 1959-60, there have been 40 teams to have won at least 55 points from their opening 27 games of a second tier EFL season (based on three points for a win), and just one of those (QPR in 2013-14 – who eventually won the playoffs) have failed to finish inside the top two at the end of the season. The real-life Championship table shows Southampton as the third-best team in the league ahead of matchday 28 next weekend, but do the underlying performances both in attack and defence paint a different picture? The short answer is no. Looking at our expected points model, Southampton have still been the third best Championship team across the 2023-24 season, but they’re behind Leeds and Leicester instead of Leicester and Ipswich in reality. The Opta expected points model simulates the number of goals scored by each side in each match based on the expected goals (xG) value of every shot taken. It then uses the simulated number of goals to determine the match outcome (win/draw/loss). Each match is simulated 10,000 times. The expected points for each team in each match can then be calculated based on the proportion of simulations they win/draw/lose. This is of course not an exact science, as xG data doesn’t include factors, such as game state and dangerous periods of possession that don’t lead to shots, but it’s still a handy barometer to measure underlying team performance. Back in mid-December, we pondered whether the Championship table was lying to us, as Leeds were top of the expected points table and below both Leicester and Ipswich. Now, seven league games later, Leeds are still top but no longer performing above their expected points total. Back on 11 December when we ran the original article, Southampton were seventh in the expected points table – they are now third. Ipswich were overperforming by 12 points at the time, based on their underlying xG for and against data. Since then, they’ve won 10 points in seven games and the gap has reduced from seven points to just three between second and third place. Rather than having numerous star players, this Southampton side are a sum of their parts. Of course, Adam Armstrong leads the league for total goal involvements (25) and assists (11), while only Blackburn’s Sammie Szmodics (16) has scored more goals than the Saints’ forward (14). But for a side that has taken the most non-penalty shots in the Championship this season (421) to have no player among the top 25 chance creators per 90 minutes (1,000+ minutes) almost makes them more dangerous – they have numerous creative options and there’s no one player that opposition sides can stifle to nullify the threat Southampton pose. Ryan Manning has averaged the most chances created per 90 among the Southampton squad this season (1.9), just ahead of Stuart Armstrong (1.8), while Adam Armstrong has averaged their highest expected assists (xA) per 90 of 0.21.  However, the depth of their creative options is clear: seven different Southampton players to have played at least 1,000 league minutes this season have averaged an xA of at least 0.14. That’s more than any other side and more than double the pool of Ipswich and Leeds (both three players) and three more than league-leaders Leicester (four players). This weekend will see Martin take his Southampton side to south Wales as he returns to Swansea City for the first time since leaving to join Saints in the summer. He’ll also come up against his former assistant at MK Dons and the Swans, Luke Williams. Williams, another disciple of the possession-based game, only joined Swansea as manager earlier this month after winning promotion from the National League and starting this season well at Notts County, breaking possession and passing records along the way. Swansea’s appointment of Michael Duff from Barnsley in the summer failed to work out because his style of play was so far departed from that of Martin and the playing squad that was left to him. On paper, there should be no such issues with Williams as boss. A win for Southampton will see them move into the automatic promotion places at the expense of Ipswich, who don’t play until Monday, and it would be the first time since 22 September that Kieran McKenna’s side have spent a night outside the top two. With their next game coming at Leicester, there is every chance that Southampton could end the month in the top two places, too, with the Championship schedule being hit hard next week by FA Cup action. If Southampton manage to get themselves into the top two, there’s every chance they’ll stay there. Russell Martin’s sides don’t give much away, after all. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to it with our Egypt vs Ghana prediction and preview. Matchday 2 in Group B kicks off with the two pre-tournament group favourites, Egypt and Ghana, in desperate need of a positive result after both sides failed to win their opening group matches.  Egypt led early on against Mozambique through Mostafa Mohamed – Egypt’s fastest goal in the Africa Cup of Nations since Ayman Mansour in 1994 against Gabon – but needed a stoppage-time penalty from captain Mohamed Salah to salvage a point. That came after Egypt had gone behind, with goals from Witi and Clésio putting Mozambique in front.  Remarkably, Egypt conceded more goals in this encounter than they had in their 11 previous AFCON group matches combined (one goal against Nigeria in 2022), while Mozambique scored 2+ goals in an AFCON game for just the second time in their history.  In truth, the Pharaohs deserved their point, and could maybe count themselves unfortunate they didn’t get all three. Egypt’s 21 shots at goal was the joint-most they’ve ever had in an AFCON match, while Mozambique scored with their only two shots on target, converting 25% of their touches in Egypt’s box into goals (2/8). Still, their point means the Pharaohs will be looking to avoid failing to win either of their first two group games in a tournament since doing so in 1992, a tournament that included defeat to Ghana on MD 2. Ghana’s AFCON 2023 campaign got off to terrible start with the Black Stars suffering a 2-1 defeat to Cape Verde on MD 1. It extended Ghana’s winless run at AFCON to five matches (D2 L3), their longest-ever winless run in the competition. Having lost their final game of the last edition of the tournament, they’re looking to avoid losing three AFCON games in a row for the first time in their history.  Although they came into the encounter against Cape Verde as pre-game favourites, Ghana were thoroughly outplayed. Cape Verde amassed 15 shots worth 3.0 expected goals, and Bubista’s side also enjoyed more of the ball.  Chris Hughton’s men now have the lowest estimated probability of any side of progressing from Group B (47.4%), while Egypt are still in a strong position to do so (81.7%). A loss here for either side could be terminal to their chances of qualification. This will be the fifth encounter between Egypt and Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations. They have met three times previously in the group stage (one win each and one draw), and once in the final, which Egypt won in 2010 (1-0). The last time the two met was in qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Drawn together in Group E, Egypt beat Ghana 2-0 at home before drawing 1-1 away on their way to qualifying for the finals.  According to the Opta supercomputer, it’s Egypt who are the favourites in this tie. They are given a 46.7% of beating Ghana (28.3%) in what is a crucial game for both sides. The draw occurred 25.0% of the time.  Both teams dropped in our overall tournament predictions after slow starts on MD 1. At the time of writing, Egypt are given a 6.3% chance of winning the title, down from 8.5% at the start of the tournament. Ghana, who were a 5.3% shot before a ball was kicked, are now given a slim 2.0% chance of going all the way.  Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Egypt: Mohamed Abou Gabal, Mohamed Sobhi, Mohamed El Shenawy, Ahmed El Shenawy, Ahmed Samy, Ali Gabr, Mohamed Hany, Mohamed Hamdy, Yasser Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdelmonem, Omar Kamal, Ahmed Abou El Fotouh, Ahmed Hegazy, Trézéguet, Mohamed Elneny, Marwan Attia, Mahmoud Hamada, Hamdi Fathy, Emam Ashour, Mohanad Lasheen, Zizo, Mohamed Salah, Koka, Mostafa Fathi, Kahraba, Mostafa Mohamed, Omar Marmoush.

The tournament hosts are back in action in Group A of AFCON 2023 as the Ivory Coast take on Nigeria at Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara on Thursday. The Elephants impressed in their opening game against Guinea-Bissau, with goals from Seko Fofana and Jean-Philippe Krasso handing them a 2-0 win. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see Ivory Coast avoid defeat throughout the group stage, with host nations of AFCON only having lost once in their last 38 group-stage games (W23 D14). The last time the tournament hosts lost at this stage was when Equatorial Guinea were beaten 1-0 by Zambia as joint-hosts in 2012. Jean-Louis Gasset’s side are looking to win their first two games of an AFCON since 2013, and take on Nigeria next, who were held to a surprise 1-1 draw by Equatorial Guinea in their first match. Star striker Victor Osimhen equalised for the Super Eagles just 99 seconds after Iban Salvador\\xa0had given Equatorial Guinea the lead, but despite recording an expected goals total of 3.52, José Peseiro’s men were unable to find a winner.  Osimhen had six shots, but finished the game with just a single goal to show for his efforts. The last time a Nigerian player had more shots in a single group stage game in the competition was Peter Odemwingie (seven) against Mozambique in January 2010. This will be Ivory Coast and Nigeria’s seventh meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations. As things stand, they can’t be separated. Of their six games for far, they have won two each and drawn two, scoring five goals each. Their last AFCON meeting was in 2013. Nigeria won 2-1 in the quarter-finals and went on to lift the trophy. The three previous meetings between Ivory Coast and Nigeria in the group stage of the tournament have produced only two goals (0-0 in 1980, 1-0 to Nigeria in 1990, 1-0 to Ivory Coast in 2008). According to the Opta supercomputer, it should be a close game but Ivory Coast are predicted to clinch their passage to the last 16 with a win in 40.7% of pre-match simulations. Nigeria grabbed their first victory of AFCON 2023 in 32.8% of those, while the draw occurred 27.5% of the time.  Understandably after being the only team in Group A to win their first game, the tournament hosts are heavily fancied to advance, doing so in 96.7% of simulations at the time of writing, and winning the group 63.6% of the time. Below are both teams’ current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Ivory Coast: Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté.\\xa0 Coach: Jean-Louis Gasset Nigeria: Olorunleke Ojo, Stanley Nwabali, Francis Uzoho, Kenneth Omeruo, William Troost-Ekong, Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Alhassan Yusuf, Raphael Onyedika, Joe Aribo, Frank Onyeka, Moses Simon, Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, Terem Moffi, Ademola Lookman, Umar Sadiq.\\xa0 Coach: Jose Peseiro Enjoy this?

Equatorial Guinea surprised many by earning a point in their opening game against Nigeria in Group A of AFCON 2023. The Elephants even took the lead against the three-time AFCON winners through Iban Salvador’s 36th-minute strike – their only shot on target in the game. Despite Napoli striker Victor Osimhen equalising soon after, and the Nigerians missing a host of chances in the second half, Equatorial Guinea hung on and will put themselves in a strong position to advance to the round of 16 should they defeat Guinea-Bissau on Thursday. This meeting with Guinea-Bissau presents Equatorial Guinea with the opportunity to both remain unbeaten in four successive AFCON games for the first time and score in three successive AFCON matches for the first time. Guinea-Bissau’s 2-0 defeat to hosts Ivory Coast in the opening game of the tournament came as no surprise, but they did limit one of the tournament favourites to a total of just 0.85 expected goals (xG). It’s at the other end of the pitch that the Djurtus have issues. Guinea-Bissau have had 88 shots and now gone 797 minutes at AFCON tournaments without scoring a goal, since Piqueti’s 13th-minute strike against Cameroon in January 2017. Their eight successive games without scoring at the AFCON is a tournament record. Before 2023, Guinea-Bissau have played in three AFCON tournaments (2017, 2019 and 2021). They have thus far failed to progress from the group stage and finished all three tournaments with the same record – fourth in the group with one draw and two losses. This will be the first ever Africa Cup of Nations meeting between Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. They did meet in a friendly match in Portugal on 23 March 2022, which Guinea-Bissau won 3-0, while Equatorial Guinea also lost a 2011 friendly against their opponents by three goals (4-1 defeat). The Opta supercomputer predicts that the most likely winner of this match is Equatorial Guinea, after they won in 39.4% of pre-match simulations. It’s likely to be tight, however, with Guinea-Bissau winning 33.8% of the time and a draw occurring in 26.8% of the 10,000 sims before kick-off at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan. Before their 1-1 draw with Nigeria on MD 1, Equatorial Guinea were given a 51.4% chance of progressing to the knockout stages. That has now improved following that impressive point. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer following the opening matches of the tournament: Equatorial Guinea: Aitor Embela, Manuel Sapunga, Jesús Owono, Saúl Coco, Basilio Ndong, Carlos Akapo, Esteban Orozco, Néstor Senra, Marvin Anieboh, Emilio Nsue, José Elo, Charles Ondo, Féderico Bikoro, José Machín, Santiago Eneme, Pablo Ganet, Álex Balboa, Jannick Buyla, Iban Salvador, José Miranda, Óscar Siafá, José Nabil, Salomón Obama, Noé Ela, Luís Asué.

The two underdogs of Group B at the Africa Cup of Nations go into their duel at Félix Houphouët-Boigny Stadium on the back of excellent results in their opening games. Cape Verde sealed a dramatic late 2-1 win against a lacklustre Ghana on Matchday 1 thanks to a stoppage-time goal from Garry Rodrigues. It was just Cape Verde’s third ever win at the AFCON, but it was more than deserved against the Black Stars. They had 15 shots in total, more than they’d managed in their previous three games in the competition combined (13). It was also the most they’d attempted in an AFCON game since January 2015 vs DR Congo (also 15). Jamiro Monteiro gave Cape Verde a lead that they held until just before the hour, when Alexander Djiku levelled. That was Ghana’s only shot on target all game, though, and they paid for an insipid showing when they were unable to stop Gilson Benchimol from waltzing through their defence and poking the ball to fellow substitute Rodrigues for a 92nd-minute tap-in. Rodrigues and his teammates races into the stands to celebrate.  Mozambique were mere minutes away from beating Egypt. A late Mohamed Salah penalty denied them, but a 2-2 draw was still a solid outcome. It could still prove to be a valuable point for the Mambas, especially if they can get a win in this second game against Cape Verde. They may well need to score at least twice to do so, though. Mozambique have never kept a clean sheet at the Africa Cup of Nations, conceding 28 goals in 13 games and letting in at least two in 12 of those. Only Zimbabwe (15 games) ever played more matches at the AFCON without at least one clean sheet. They defended manfully in the main against Salah and Egypt, though, so will take heart from that as they look for their first ever AFCON victory. Mozambique have drawn three and lost 10 of their games in the tournament.  This will be the first encounter between Cape Verde and Mozambique at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. They have faced off four times in AFCON qualifying, though, with Cape Verde winning twice and Mozambique once (D1). Their last clash came in March 2021 when Cape Verde won 1-0 thanks to a Faisal Bangal own goal at Estádio Nacional do Zimpeto. After their big win over Ghana, the Opta supercomputer makes Cape Verde favourites to make it back-to-back wins and seal qualification. Bubista’s side have been handed a 44.1% chance of victory, with Mozambique considered to have a 30.2% likelihood. The draw is rated at 25.7%.  Our pre-tournament predictions had Cape Verde reaching the last 16 – as they did two years ago – in 52.9% of simulations, but after their opening victory, that has shot up close to 89.2% (at the time of writing). Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Cape Verde: Márcio da Rosa, Vózinha, Dylan Silva, Stopira, Dylan Tavares, João Correia, Logan Costa, Steven Moreira, Pico, Diney Borges, Kenny Rocha, Laros Duarte, Deroy Duarte, Kevin Pina, Cuca, Patrick Andrade, Jamiro Monteiro, João Paulo, Ryan Mendes, Willy Semedo, Garry Rodrigues, Jovane Cabral, Bebé, Bryan Teixeira, Hélio Varela, Gilson Benchimol.\\xa0 Coach: Bubista Mozambique: Ivan Urrubal, Ernan, Fazito, Reinildo, David Malembana, Domingos Macandza, Bruno Langa, Mexer, Nanani, Edmilson Dove, Amadou, Clésio, Guima, Alfons Amade, Dominguês, Shaquille,\\xa0João Bonde, Nené, Gildo Lourenço, Stanley Ratifo, Geny Catamo, Witi, Lau King.\\xa0 Coach: Chiquinho Conde Enjoy this?

We look ahead to it with our Guinea vs Gambia prediction and preview. Matchday 2 in Group C ends with the two outsiders, Guinea and Gambia, both looking to find their first win of the tournament.  Guinea held Cameroon to a 1-1 draw in the opening round of games. They took an early lead through Mohamed Bayo and could well have held onto that advantage had captain François Kamano\\xa0not seen a straight red card towards the end of the first half. Frank Magri equalised for Cameroon, and left Guinea winless in their last four Africa Cup of Nations matches (D2 L2). Gambia were comprehensively beaten 3-0 by Senegal on MD 1. They too were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time, with Ebou Adams dismissed for raking his studs down Lamine Camara’s Achilles. Camara went on to bag a brace in the second period, after Pape Gueye had opened the scoring after four minutes. That result meant after going unbeaten in their first four games at the Africa Cup of Nations (W3 D1), Gambia have lost their last two matches without scoring. This will be the second meeting between Guinea and Gambia at the Africa Cup of Nations after facing off in the last 16 of the 2022 edition. The game resulted in a 1-0 win for Gambia (Musa Barrow with the goal) and two red cards. According to the Opta supercomputer, it’s Guinea who are the favourites in this tie. They are given a 48.3% of picking up their first win of the tournament, consigning Gambia (27.2%) to their second defeat. The draw occurred 24.5% of the time.  Both teams are very much outsiders in our overall tournament predictions. At the time of writing, Guinea are given just a 1.8% chance of winning the title, and Gambia are our second-longest side at 0.2%. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer. Both Guinea and Gambia are up against it even if they want to qualify for the last 16.  Guinea: Ibrahim Koné, Aly Keita, Moussa Camara, Mohamed Ali Camara, Sekou Sylla, Julian Jeanvier, Saïdou Sow, Mouctar Diakhaby, Antoine Conté, Issiaga Sylla, Ibrahim Diakité, Seydouba Cissé, Amadou Diawara, Naby Keïta, Mory Konaté, Ilaix Moriba, Abdoulaye Touré, Aguibou Camara, Mohamed Bayo, José Kanté, Serhou Guirassy, Morgan Guilavogui, Facinet Conté, Karim Cissé, François Kamano.\\xa0 Coach: Kaba Diawara\\xa0 Gambia: Modou Jobe, Lamin Sarr, Baboucarr Gaye, Ibou Touray, Omar Colley, Bubacarr Sanneh, Saidy Janko, James Gomez, Noah Sonko Sundberg, Jacob Mendy, Muhammed Sanneh, Sulayman Marreh, Ablie Jallow, Dawda Ngum, Alasana Manneh, Yusupha Bobb, Hamza Barry, Ebou Adams, Ebrima Darboe, Assan Ceesay, Muhammed Badamosi, Abdoulie Sanyang, Musa Barrow, Ebrima Colley, Yankuba Minteh, Alieu Fadera, Ali Sowe.\\xa0 Coach: Tom Saintfiet\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Two of the last three AFCON winners meet at Charles Konan Banny Stadium on Friday as Senegal face Cameroon in Group C. Defending champions Senegal impressed in their opening game, dispatching Gambia 3-0 thanks to Pape Gueye’s early opener and a brace from Lamine Camara. Aged 20 years and 14 days, Camara is the youngest Senegalese player to score a goal at the Africa Cup of Nations since Souleymane Camara against Zambia in 2002 (19y, 34d), and the youngest Senegalese ever to score two in an AFCON game. Camara is also the youngest player to score a brace at the Africa Cup of Nations since Tunisia’s Ali Zitouni in 2000 (19y, 32d). 2000 – Aged 20 years and 14 days, Lamine Camara is the youngest player to score a brace at the AFCON since Ali Zitouni for Tunisia in 2000 (19 years and 32 days). Banger. #SENGAM pic.twitter.com/gxWiBndR3M It was the fifth consecutive AFCON tournament that Senegal have won their opening game, a joint-record along with Nigeria (between 1976 and 1984). The Lions of Teranga are looking to win their first two matches of an AFCON since 2017. Standing in their way are Cameroon, who could only draw their first game against Guinea. Mohamed Bayo put Guinea ahead after 10 minutes, before Frank Magri headed in an equaliser early in the second half. Goalkeeper André Onana was missing from that game due to only playing for Manchester United in their 2-2 draw with Tottenham the day before, but he should be available to manager Rigobert Song for this one. Georges-Kévin Nkoudou will likely be crucial for Cameroon’s ability to create chances, having created seven in the draw with Guinea. Prior to this tournament, the last player to create more chances in a single AFCON game was Burkina Faso’s Charles Kaboré against Ghana in February 2013 (nine). Senegal pair Sadio Mané and Ismaïla Sarr recorded an assist each in their win over Gambia, and have assisted four (two each) of Senegal’s last five goals at the Africa Cup of Nations. This will be the fifth time Senegal and Cameroon have faced off at the Africa Cup of Nations. Their only previous meeting in the group stage saw Senegal win 2-0 in 1990, while the Indomitable Lions have won all three knockout clashes; in the 1992 quarter-finals (1-0), 2002 final (3-2 on penalties) and the 2017 quarter-finals (5-4 on pens). Only three goals have been scored in the four matches between Senegal and Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations, with both of their last two encounters finishing 0-0 after extra-time and heading to penalties. The Opta supercomputer considers Senegal to be the favourites, giving Aliou Cissé’s team a 47.8% chance of a win that would seal their passage to the last 16. Cameroon have a 27.6% likelihood of recording their first victory at AFCON 2023, while the draw is rated at 24.6%. Our pre-tournament predictions had Senegal as the favourites to win the trophy (12.8%), while Cameroon were seventh favourites at 7.4%. It was a good start for Senegal, whose chances of qualifying for the last 16 are already up in the high 90s. Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Senegal: Mory Diaw, Seny Dieng, Édouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Youssouf Sabaly, Ismail Jakobs, Formose Mendy, Abdoulaye N’Diaye, Abdou Diallo, Fodé Ballo-Touré, Abdoulaye Seck, Moussa Niakhaté, Krépin Diatta, Idrissa Gueye, Pathé Ciss, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Nampalys Mendy, Lamine Camara, Pape Gueye, Pape Sarr, Sadio Mané, Habib Diallo, Nicolas Jackson, Boulaye Dia, Ismaïla Sarr, Iliman Ndiaye, Abdallah Sima.\\xa0 Coach: Aliou Cissé Cameroon: André Onana, Fabrice Ondoa, Dévis Epassy, Simon Ngapandouetnbu, Nouhou Tolo, Junior Tchamadeu, Oumar Gonzalez, Darlin Yongwa, Christopher Wooh, Harold Moukoudi, Jean-Charles Castelletto, Enzo Tchato, Malcom Bokélé, Yvan Neyou, Olivier Kemen, Frank Anguissa, Ben Elliott, Wilfried Nathan Douala, Olivier Ntcham, Karl Toko-Ekambi, Frank Magri, Vincent Aboubakar, Moumi Ngamaleu, Faris Moumbagna, Leonel Ateba, Georges-Kévin Nkoudou, Clinton N’Jie.

With DR Congo and Zambia drawn in Group F of AFCON 2023 alongside 2022 World Cup semi-finalists Morocco, there’s a general feeling this game could be decisive. As suggested in our Group F preview for the tournament, DR Congo might have one of the outside bets for tournament top scorer in their ranks. Braga forward Simon Banza comes into AFCON 2023 as the leading goalscorer in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, with 14 strikes. He’s joined in attack by Brentford star Yoane Wissa, who has enjoyed a positive first half to the 2023-24 Premier League campaign. DR Congo qualified for AFCON 2023 as winners of Group I ahead of Mauritania, Gabon and Sudan. They finished the group with 12 points from six matches, with their two losses coming against the two teams that didn’t qualify. DR Congo were actually bottom of the group after two matches before rallying impressively to secure their place at the tournament.  DR Congo have previously qualified for AFCON 19 times, winning it twice, in 1968 and most recently in 1974, beating Ghana and Zambia in the finals respectively. In addition, they have finished third twice (1998, 2015) and fourth in 1972. DR Congo’s last appearance at AFCON was in 2019, when they reached the round of 16 before losing to Madagascar on penalties. The Zambians are back at AFCON for the first time since 2015, with this their 18th participation overall. In fact, the last time they won a match at the Africa Cup of Nations was in 2012, when they eventually edged the final on penalties against Ivory Coast. They haven’t won any of their six AFCON games since that success. Now led by veteran coach Avram Grant, Zambia qualified for AFCON 2023 as Group H winners, ahead of host nation Ivory Coast (who were guaranteed a place in the tournament anyway), Comoros and Lesotho. They won 13 points from their six matches, with their only loss coming against Ivory Coast in their first match despite a 94th-minute Patson Daka consolation goal to make it 3-1. Daka’s five goals in qualifying was only surpassed by Victor Osimhen (10). Zambia have previously participated at AFCON 17 times. They have won it once, in 2012, beating Ivory Coast 8-7 on penalties following a 0-0 draw after extra time. They have also come second twice, and third three times. Zambia’s last appearance at AFCON was in 2015, when they disappointingly didn’t make it out of the group after going ahead but losing 2-1 to Tunisia. This will be the fourth meeting between these two teams at the Africa Cup of Nations. They met in the final 50 years ago in 1974 (DR Congo as Zaire), with Zaire eventually winning 2-0 in a replay after the original match ended 2-2 two days earlier. This is the only AFCON final to ever go to a replay. The last match between DR Congo and Zambia at the AFCON ended in a 1-1 draw in the group stage of the 2015 tournament. The Opta supercomputer predicts DR Congo will win this AFCON 2023 group stage game against Zambia, with the Leopards winning 43.0% of the pre-match simulations. In our pre-tournament AFCON 2023 predictions (before a ball was kicked), both of these nations were considered rank outsiders for the trophy, with DR Congo the 11th favourites (2.4%), well away from nations such as Senegal (12.8%), Ivory Coast (12.1%), Morocco (11.1%), Algeria (9.7%) and Egypt (8.5%). Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer following the opening matches of the tournament: DR Congo: Baggio Siadi, Lionel Mpasi, Dimitry Bertaud, Arthur Masuaku, Henock Inonga, Chancel Mbemba, Rocky Bushiri, Joris Kayembe, Dylan Batubinsika, Gédéon Kalulu, Gaël Kakuta, Brian Bayeye, Grady Diangana, Samuel Moutoussamy, Aaron Tshibola, Charles Pickel, Yoane Wissa, Simon Banza, Meschack Elia, Fiston Mayele, Théo Bongonda, Silas Katompa Mvumpa, Cédric Bakambu.

Exactly 13 months on from losing 2-1 to Croatia in the World Cup third-place play-off, the Atlas Lions get their AFCON Group F campaign started against Tanzania. Given what Morocco achieved in Qatar and the fact they’ve broken into the top 15 teams in the world, this should – in theory – be a mismatch, with Tanzania making only their third appearance at the AFCON. But if the first few days of AFCON 2023 have told us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected, with Nigeria, Egypt and Ghana all falling to shock results, with the latter even suffering a late defeat to Cape Verde. There’s undoubtedly been an aura of confidence enveloping Morocco since the World Cup, however, and the talent they possess is considerable with the likes of Achraf Hakimi, Youssef En-Nesyri, Hakim Ziyech, Sofyan Amrabat and Bilal El Khannouss, who is one of our lesser-known players to watch. Their route through qualifying was fairly straightforward as well. They won qualification Group K ahead of South Africa and Liberia, as well as Zimbabwe, who were disqualified due to FIFA suspending them for political interference. Walid Regragui’s men finished with nine points from their four matches, their only loss coming against South Africa, who also made it to AFCON 2023. Of the 23 nations that reached the tournament (Ivory Coast automatically qualified as hosts), no team had their qualification confirmed earlier than Morocco (24 March 2023). This will be their 19th participation in the AFCON, though their record is unspectacular. They’ve only won it once, in 1976, and reached the final on just one other occasion, losing the 2004 showpiece to Tunisia. Two years ago, in the 2021 edition, Morocco reached the quarter-finals but lost to eventual finalists Egypt 2-1 after extra time. Tanzania, on the other hand, are very inexperienced at this level. They’ve participated at AFCON only twice prior to 2023 and never progressed beyond the group stage, only earning a single point over their two tournament runs. \\xa0 They qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up to Algeria in Group F ahead of Uganda and Niger. They got eight points from their six games, the lowest tally of any qualifying team that played all six matches, as well has having the joint-lowest goal difference (-1). They confirmed their qualification with a draw against Algeria on 7 September, being the only team to take points off the Fennec Foxes in qualifying. This will be the first encounter between Morocco and Tanzania at the Africa Cup of Nations. They faced each other last November in World Cup qualifying – Morocco won 2-0 in Dar-es-Salaam. Morocco are heavy favourites for this match, with the Opta supercomputer predicting a win in favour of the Atlas Lions. They won 62.9% of the pre-match simulations, compared to Tanzania’s win probability of just 18.0%. The draw is rated at 19.1%. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Morocco as third favourites to lift the trophy, going all the way in 11.1% of the 10,000 simulations. Only defending champions Senegal (12.8%) and hosts Ivory Coast (12.1%) were deemed likelier to take the title than Morocco. On the flip side, Tanzania are considered one of the weakest sides at the tournament. Their 0.6% win probability before the tournament started was only better than Angola and Namibia, both on 0.5%. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Morocco: Munir Mohamedi, Yassine Bounou, Mehdi Benabid, Nayef Aguerd, Achraf Hakimi, Romain Saïss, Chadi Riad, Yahya Attiat-Allah, Abdel Abqar, Yunis Abdelhamid, Noussair Mazraoui, Mohamed Chibi, Sofyan Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Amir Richardson, Selim Amallah, Oussama El Azzouzi, Amine Harit, Azzedine Ounahi, Bilal El Khannouss, Sofiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri, Abde Ezzalzouli, Ismael Saibari, Tarik Tissoudali, Amine Adli, Ayoub El Kaabi.

Our latest edition includes numbers on El Clásico, Premier League game state, and Manchester United forwards. Some of our favourite things come in halves. Half a lager, half a dozen eggs, half and half scarves… Okay, maybe not everything. With the Premier League on its winter break, we only got half a matchday from Friday to Sunday, but we weren’t exactly short-changed. That being said, we’ve decided to kick things off in Spain (or Saudi Arabia) this week by looking at the Supercopa de España final between Real Madrid and Barcelona. Never fear though Premier League fans, we’ll also be looking at which teams have spent the most time in the lead, level and behind in games this season. No half measures from SVQ this week. We don’t need a winter break, though it could be argued that writing a weekly newsletter isn’t quite as physically draining as playing elite football… aargh! Finger cramp! If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week.  We were treated to an extra Clásico when Real Madrid and Barcelona both advanced to the final of the Supercopa de España in Saudi Arabia, which seemed like excellent news all round for football fans. And it was, unless you happen to support Barcelona. A hat-trick from Vinícius Júnior and another goal from Rodrygo gave Carlo Ancelotti’s men a comfortable win, with Robert Lewandowksi’s excellent strike ultimately a consolation in Real Madrid’s 4-1 victory in Riyadh. The treble from Vinícius was just the 18th hat-trick in El Clásico history, joining the likes of Ferenc Puskás, Gary Lineker, Romario, Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Karim Benzema in firing three in one game against the old enemy. With there being just 32 minutes between his first and third goals (7th and 39th minutes) it was the second-quickest Clásico treble ever, behind only Madrid’s Jesús Narro, who scored his three goals against Barça in January 1951 in 21 minutes (between the 8th and 29th minutes). The Brazilian slips in ahead of Iván Zamorano, who scored a hat-trick against the Blaugrana in January 1995 between the 5th and 39th minutes (34 minutes), suggesting there must be something about Los Blancos facing Barcelona in January. Vinícius took his three goals from an overall expected goals (xG) total in the game of 2.6, with his first and third goals tap-ins after Madrid broke Barça’s high line, before he tucked away a penalty after being fouled by Ronald Araújo, who was later sent off for two bookings. With Real Madrid seven points ahead of fourth-place Barcelona in LaLiga – albeit a point behind leaders Girona having played a game fewer – the Clásico perhaps doesn’t have the significance it usually does this season. That won’t take any of the shine off a fine effort from Vinícius, though. Game state, it’s what football’s all about. I mean, quite literally, the state of games is the thing we care about most, though admittedly largely the state of it when the final whistle goes. We don’t mean ‘state’ as in\\xa0“Look at the state of that shower of useless…”\\xa0but whether a team is winning, losing or drawing in a game. It will probably not surprise many to learn that, in the 2023-24 Premier League so far, Manchester City have been behind for the lowest proportion of their game time (11%). That would have been even less had they not been 2-1 down at Newcastle United for 37 minutes on Saturday before Kevin De Bruyne made football look like the easiest thing in the world to turn it around for the defending champions at St James’ Park. There are some interesting sub-stories from the above viz, though. Liverpool lead the Premier League despite having been drawing games for longer than any other team (53%), and only being ahead for 33% of the time, less than six other teams including West Ham and Brighton. However, Jürgen Klopp’s men are good at not being behind, with only Man City losing for less time than their 14%. Brighton have been the most all-or-nothing team, only drawing for 34% of the time, winning for 34% and being behind for 32%, meaning they are incredibly difficult to predict. There is almost an exact one-in-three chance they’ll be winning, losing or drawing at any time. The bottom end of the table is perhaps more predictable, with Burnley (45%) and Sheffield United (48%) being behind for the longest time. In fact, the Blades have only been leading for 6% of their games, so next time you’re ahead in a match Sheffield United fans, please do enjoy it while it lasts. We have to talk about Manchester United, though, and this time it’s not necessarily a criticism. Erik ten Hag’s men have been almost exclusively winning or losing every game this season, until recently. Their 0-0 draw at Liverpool last month and the 2-2 home stalemate with Tottenham on Sunday are their only two draws in 21 league games (W10 L9), despite their game state across those games being a draw for 51% of the time, with only three teams drawing for longer. All that matters is the score at the final whistle, though, of course. There may have only been five games in the Premier League this week, but we only need five questions, so it all worked out rather well, really. Answers at the bottom of the page. 1.\\xa0Zeki Amdouni found the net for Burnley against Luton on Friday, his fourth league goal of the season. Who are the only two Swiss players with more goals in a Premier League season? 2.\\xa0Following their 1-0 win over Fulham, over half of Chelsea’s Premier League wins this season have come since the start of December (five of nine). Who are the only team to have picked up more points in the competition than their 15 in that time? 3.\\xa0Of Kevin De Bruyne’s 65 Premier League goals, 28 have come from outside the box. Of players to score at least 50 goals in the competition, who is the only player to have recorded a higher percentage from distance than the Belgian (43%)? 4.\\xa0In Everton’s 0-0 draw with Aston Villa, Séamus Coleman made his 355th Premier League appearance. Whose record for appearances in the competition for the Merseyside club did he beat? 5.\\xa0Rasmus Højlund’s fine strike against Tottenham on Sunday was Manchester United’s earliest Premier League goal at Old Trafford (2 minutes, 32 seconds) since who found the net early on in December 2020 against Leeds United? This week’s question comes from Muritala Azeez (@Az_Constitution) who asks:\\xa0“Is there truly an increase in the output of Højlund and Rashford?” Do you have a stat-based question you’d like Opta to answer in a future edition of SVQ? Email us at\\xa0editors@theanalyst.com\\xa0or message us on X\\xa0@OptaAnalyst\\xa0with #AskOpta and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: In terms of goals, yes. Looking just at their Premier League numbers this season, prior to December, Marcus Rashford had scored two (0.18 per 90 mins) and assisted one (0.09 p90) in 12 games (all starts), while Rasmus Højlund was yet to score in nine appearances (eight starts). Since the start of December, Rashford has again scored two (0.46 p90) and assisted one (0.23 p90) in eight games (four starts), while Højlund has also scored two (0.38 p90) and assisted one (0.19 p90) in seven appearances (five starts). However, in terms of xG, Rashford has actually gone down quite a bit, with an average of 0.41 xG per 90 minutes prior to December and just 0.09 per 90 since. Despite breaking his duck against Aston Villa last month and adding another against Spurs on Sunday, Højlund’s xG per 90 has gone down from 0.34 to 0.13 in the same timeframe. If you include creativity in their output, Rashford’s numbers are also not too favourable in recent games. Before December, the England international had created 15 chances in total and 12 from open play for his Manchester United teammates in the Premier League. Since the start of December, he has created just one chance in total (which was from open play), going from 1.31 chances created per 90 down to just 0.23. Højlund, on the other hand, created seven chances (all from open play) before December and has created six since, with his per-90 rate going up from 0.97 to 1.14. All that said, if the goals and assists are starting to arrive, the other stats won’t particularly matter to manager Erik ten Hag right now.

We look ahead to it with our Mali vs South Africa prediction and preview. Monday night’s game between Mali and South Africa will be the second of Group E in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. These two sides, together with Tunisia and Namibia, make up what looks like the most even group on paper. All four teams have a realistic shot of qualifying for the last 16. According to the Opta supercomputer, Mali have a 74.9% chance of doing just that, while their first opponents of the tournament, South Africa, have a 66.8% likelihood of progression.  Mali qualified for AFCON 2023 as winners of Group G, ahead of Gambia, Congo and South Sudan. They finished with 15 points from their six games, only dropping points in a 1-0 loss to second place Gambia. Across all qualified teams, only Algeria finished their group with more points (16).  Mali are AFCON regulars. This is their 13th participation in the Africa Cup of Nations, including their ninth in a row; no side has played as many games as Mali (54) at the tournament without ever winning the trophy. Their best performance dates back to 1972 when they lost 3-2 in the final against Congo.  Recent editions have seen them progress from the group stage before being knocked out at the next hurdle. They reached the round of 16 in the last two AFCON tournaments, but lost to Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea in 2019 and 2021 respectively. Despite an injury crisis coming into the tournament – coach Éric Chelle will be without big players in Ibrahima Koné, Crystal Palace’s Cheick Doucouré, Massadio Haïdara and former Southampton winger Moussa Djenepo – they’ll be hoping to go better than that this year.  South Africa qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up of Group K, ahead of Liberia and the disqualified Zimbabwe. They got seven points in their four games, with their only loss coming against group winners Morocco, who were also one of only two teams to qualify earlier than South Africa, who secured their spot on the March 28, 2023 (Morocco: March 24 2023, and Algeria: March 27 2023). South Africa have previously participated at the AFCON 10 times. They won their first ever AFCON as hosts in 1996, beating Tunisia 2-0 in the final in Johannesburg, but after that heady win, Bafana Bafana have struggled to shine in their subsequent nine AFCON appearances. Their most recent campaign was in 2019, when they reached the quarter-finals but lost 2-1 to Nigeria. More than half of the squad currently play for Mamelodi Sundowns, who have been the most dominant club in South African club football over the last decade.  The South African side are currently the top-ranked club team in Africa based on the Opta Power Rankings: This will be the third encounter between Mali and South Africa at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. The two previous meetings saw Mali prevail, both times in the quarter-finals: 2-0 in the 2002 edition and on penalties in 2013 (1-1 after extra-time, 3-1 on penalties). According to the Opta supercomputer, Mali are predicted to get their 2023 AFCON campaign off to a positive start, winning this match in 43.5% of pre-match simulations. South Africa took all three points in 30.6% of those, while the draw occurred 25.8% of the time.  In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had both of these sides as outside shots for the title. Mali won AFCON 2023 in 3.6% of the supercomputer’s simulations, while South Africa won it 2.4% of the time.  Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Mali: Djigui Diarra, Aboubacar Doumbia, Ismaël Diawara, Mamadou Fofana I, Kiki Kouyaté, Sikou Niakaté, Hamari Traoré, Amadou Danté, Falaye Sacko, Moussa Diarra, Lassana Coulibaly, Adama Traoré, Yves Bissouma, Amadou Haidara, Aliou Dieng, Diadié Samassékou, Kamory Doumbia, Boubacar Traoré, Mohamed Camara, Moussa Doumbia, Sékou Koïta, Fousseni Diabaté, Ibrahim Sissoko, Lassine Sinayoko, Siriné Doucouré, Youssoufou Niakaté, Nene Dorgeles.

The second match of Group D at AFCON 2023 will be between Burkina Faso and Mauritania at Stade de la Paix in Bouaké on Tuesday. Burkina Faso qualified for AFCON 2023 as Group B winners ahead of Cape Verde, Togo and Eswatini. They finished the group with 11 points, the lowest total for a group-winning nation that played all six qualifying games, edging out Cape Verde by a single point, against whom they suffered their only group stage loss. Their qualification was confirmed on 28 March 2023, with only hosts Ivory Coast, Morocco and Algeria securing their places earlier. The Stallions have previously qualified for AFCON on 12 occasions. Their best performance was in 2013, when they reached the final but were defeated 1-0 by Nigeria. They have also come third once (2017), defeating Ghana in the third-place play-off, and fourth twice, in 1998 and two years ago, losing in the third-place match on penalties to DR Congo and Cameroon respectively. They have scored in their last 14 AFCON matches, which is not only the current longest active streak, but also the second-longest in AFCON history. In their two AFCON warm-up games, Burkina Faso lost 2-1 to Iran on 5 January before winning 2-1 against DR Congo five days later. That loss to Iran is their only defeat across their last six internationals. Burkina Faso have never won their opening game at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament (D5 L7), but they open up their 2023 AFCON with a game against a team who haven’t won a single Africa Cup of Nations match ever, Mauritania. The underdogs have drawn two games and lost four across two previous AFCON tournaments (2019 and 2021) and haven’t even led in a match at the tournament. They’ve only scored one goal in their six AFCON games and that was a penalty – they come into this game on a run of 468 minutes without a goal in the competition and were one of just two teams that failed to score at the 2021 tournament despite attempting 38 shots. Mauritania qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in Group I, ahead of Gabon and Sudan, but behind DR Congo. They went into their final match against Gabon on the 9 September 2023 with the winner guaranteed to qualify for the tournament. Mauritania won that decider 2-1 thanks to first-half goals from Hemeya Tanji and Aboubakar Kamara. They come into this match on a three-game scoreless streak, having failed to net in games versus DR Congo, South Sudan and Tunisia. However, their last goal came against Burkina Faso in a friendly back in October. This will be the first encounter between Burkina Faso and Mauritania at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. Their last meeting only came back in October, when Burkina Faso won 2-1 in a friendly played in Morocco. Mohamed Konate and Stephane Aziz Ki put Burkina Faso into a 2-0 lead before Pape Ibnou Ba got one back for Mauritania midway through the second half. Their last competitive meeting came in a March 2019 AFCON qualifier, which Burkina Faso won 1-0 with a goal from Bertrand Traoré. Burkina Faso are predicted to win this AFCON 2023 group game against Mauritania by the Opta supercomputer. They won 47.6% of the pre-match simulations, while Mauritania picked up their first ever AFCON victory in 27.6% of sims before kick-off in this clash at Stade de la Paix on Tuesday. Despite making the semi-finals in three of the last five AFCON tournaments, Burkina Faso aren’t fancied to pick up their first Africa Cup of Nations title in 2023 by the Opta supercomputer. In our pre-tournament AFCON predictions, they were given just a 1.9% chance of winning the trophy and below 12 other teams. Senegal were installed as favourites, ahead of host nation Ivory Coast, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria. Only Angola and Namibia (0.5%) were given a smaller chance of winning the tournament than Mauritania. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Burkina Faso: Hervé Koffi, Hillel Konaté, Kilian Nikièma, Sébastien Tou, Edmond Tapsoba, Steeve Yago, Issoufou Dayo, Valentin Nouma, Abdoul Guiébré, Adamo Nagalo, Nasser Djiga, Issa Kaboré, Blati Touré, Bertrand Traoré, Gustavo Sangaré, Sacha Bansé, Mamady Bangré, Cédric Badolo, Ismahila Ouédraogo, Dramane Salou, Adama Guira, Djibril Ouattara, Mohamed Konaté, Abdoul Tapsoba, Aziz Ki, Hassane Bandé, Dango Ouattara.

Anything other than progress from Group E will be a major disappointment for Tunisia, who begin their Africa Cup of Nations campaign on Tuesday against one of the least-fancied teams in the whole tournament, Namibia, at Amadou Gon Coulibaly Stadium in Korhogo. The Carthage Eagles may be without a few recognisable names, with Wahbi Khazri retiring from the national team in 2022, Manchester United’s Hannibal Mejbri opting out of the squad and Elias Saad being blacklisted, but they should still have enough to at least avoid the failure of group stage elimination. Beating Namibia first up would see them take a big step towards the knockouts considering four of the best third-place teams also go through. Beyond that, though, there aren’t many expecting them to go that deep into the tournament. Head coach Jalel Kadri isn’t particularly highly regarded at home, they aren’t known for playing especially exciting football and have got past the quarter-finals once (2019) since winning their maiden title as hosts in 2004. Nevertheless, qualifying presented few issues for Tunisia, who won Group J ahead of Equatorial Guinea, Botswana and Libya. They took 13 points from their six matches, the same as Equatorial Guinea, edging them out on goal difference thanks to beating Botswana on 7 September 2023, while Equatorial Guinea drew with Libya in the final round of matches. This will be Tunisia’s 21st participation in the tournament and a run to the semi-finals would likely be seen as a good account, seeing them go one better than in the 2021 edition when they were eliminated 1-0 by Burkina Faso in the last eight. By contrast, Namibia are one of the least experienced sides at this level in the tournament. They’ve only participated at the AFCON three times before this and never made it out of their group, earning only two points over their three appearances. But they just about did enough to qualify for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in Group C, edging out Burundi by a point. Kenya were also drawn into their section but were disqualified due to the Football Kenya Federation’s suspension by FIFA. Namibia won five points from their four games, with a surprise win over group winners Cameroon proving decisive – Peter Shalilule and Absalom Iimbondi got the goals in a 2-1 victory.  No team qualified for AFCON on a later date than Namibia on 12 September 2023 (Cameroon qualified the same day). Tunisia and Namibia have never met in the AFCON before; the last time they faced each other in any official game was a 2007 friendly that the Carthage Eagles won 2-0. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tunisia are firm favourites to begin their Group E campaign with a victory as the Opta supercomputer rates their chances at 61% for this game. Namibia came out on top in 19.2% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations, slightly less often than the draw (19.8%). In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Tunisia going all the way 6.3% of the time, making them eighth favourites and less than half as likely to win the trophy as frontrunners and defending champions Senegal (12.8%). Namibia, on the other hand, had their success chances rated at just 0.5%, making them the least likely to win it all alongside Angola. Below you’ll find the current, up-to-date chances of progression for both teams all the way through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Tunisia: Mouez Hassen, Béchir Ben Saïd, Aymen Dahmen, Wajdi Kechrida, Yassine Meriah, Oussama Haddadi, Montassar Talbi, Ali Maâloul, Ali Abdi, Yan Valery, Hamza Jelassi, Naïm Sliti, Ellyes Skhiri, Bassem Srarfi, Sayfallah Ltaief, Hadj Mahmoud, Aïssa Laïdouni, Mohamed Ben Romdhane, Alaa Ghram, Houssem Tka, Hamza Rafia, Anis Ben Slimane, Youssef Msakni, Taha Khenissi, Elias Achouri, Haythem Jouini, Seifeddine Jaziri.

After Algeria’s terrible 2021 tournament appearance, can they make a strong start at Stade de la Paix in Bouaké? Djamel Belmadi’s Algeria side will be looking to do something they didn’t manage at the 2021 AFCON – win a match. Their dismal showing at the tournament two years ago came despite entering on a 34-game unbeaten run. Their three matches in Cameroon saw them score just once from 46 shots, and even that was a consolation goal in their final group stage game versus Ivory Coast. They enter this tournament in good form, too. They are currently on an 11-game unbeaten run (W8 D3) since last losing in a November 2022 friendly with Sweden (2-0). They have won their last three matches in a row, including an impressive AFCON warm-up victory over Burundi on 9 January, in which goals from Baghdad Bounedjah, Islam Slimani, Mohamed Amoura and Riyad Mahrez sealed a 4-0 win. Much of their success in this edition will depend on the form of star player and captain Mahrez, who we earmarked as a key man in our AFCON Group E preview. He’s had an impressive season at Al-Ahli in the Saudi Pro League since leaving reigning Premier League and UEFA Champions League winners Manchester City. Algeria qualified for AFCON 2023 by winning Group F of qualification ahead of Tanzania, Uganda and Niger. They dropped just two points across qualifying, with their 0-0 home draw against Tanzania in the final game the only match they failed to win. As a result, their total of 16 points was the most of any side across the AFCON 2023 qualifiers. Of the 23 nations that had to qualify for AFCON 2023 (Ivory Coast automatically qualified as hosts), only Morocco (24 March 2023) qualified earlier than Algeria (27 March 2023). Algeria have participated at the AFCON 19 times before this edition, and won the trophy on two previous occasions, in 1990 – when they defeated Nigeria in the final as hosts – and more recently in 2019 when they beat Senegal 1-0 for the title thanks to a second-minute Bounedjah goal. At the last AFCON tournament played in 2022, they unexpectedly exited in the group stage after finishing bottom with just one point and one goal from three games versus Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone. It would go against recent form to see Angola going goal-crazy in this match. Their last four games have all ended 0-0, while they have scored just once in their last seven international matches – that coming via Gelson Dala in a 1-1 draw with Mozambique in October. Angola qualified for AFCON 2023 by coming second in Group E ahead of the Central African Republic and Madagascar. They won nine points across their six group stage matches, despite winning only twice, both victories coming against the Central African Republic, and their one loss to eventual group winners Ghana. Angola have previously participated in AFCON eight times. Their best performances came in 2008, when they reached the quarter-finals, falling to Egypt, and in 2010 as hosts also reaching the last eight before losing to Ghana. Angola’s last appearance at the tournament was in 2019, when they failed to make it out of the group, finishing third in the standings behind Mali and Tunisia. This will be just the second meeting between Algeria and Angola at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament. They previously came up against one another in the AFCON 2010 group stage, with the match ending 0-0 in Egypt. It was the final game of the group on that occasion, with the goalless draw seeing both Algeria and Angola qualify from Group A at the expense of Mali and Malawi. The Opta supercomputer is predicting an Algeria victory in this match, winning 64.3% of the pre-match simulations, compared to Angola’s win ratio of 17.2%. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Algeria as fourth favourites to win the trophy (9.7%) behind only Senegal, Ivory Coast and Morocco but ahead of Egypt, Nigeria, Cameroon, Tunisia and Ghana. Alongside Namibia, Angola had the lowest chance of winning this AFCON tournament at 0.5%. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Algeria: Moustapha Zeghba, Anthony Mandréa, Oussama Benbot, Raïs M’Bolhi, Aïssa Mandi, Ahmed Touba, Rayan Aït-Nouri, Mohamed Amine Tougaï, Ramy Bensebaïni, Zinéddine Belaïd, Yasser Larouci, Kévin Van Den Kerkhof, Youcef Atal, Hicham Boudaoui, Nabil Bentaleb, Youcef Belaïli, Sofiane Féghouli, Adam Ounas, Ismaël Bennacer, Houssem Aouar, Ramiz Zerrouki, Farès Chaïbi, Riyad Mahrez, Baghdad Bounedjah, Mohammed Amoura, Islam Slimani.

Cameroon come into AFCON 2023 with selection headaches, with Bryan Mbuemo out injured and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting not taken to Ivory Coast after reportedly being dropped for missing recent friendlies. Goalkeeper André Onana has missed the entire preparation for the tournament as well and will likely be unavailable for this game after Cameroon agreed to let him stay with Manchester United to play against Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday. Fabrice Ondoa has deputised between the sticks and will probably do so against Guinea. As we said in our AFCON Group C preview, manager Rigobert Song will be looking to strike pair Vincent Aboubakar and Karl Toko Ekambi for inspiration. Aboubakar scored eight goals in the 2021 edition, just one behind the all-time tournament record held by Zaire’s Ndaye Mulamba in 1974 (nine). Cameroon are not fancied by many to go all the way and win the tournament, despite only Egypt (seven) having won it more often than the Indomitable Lions (five), but the same was true before the 2017 AFCON, which they did win. Opposite Song in the dugout will be another former Premier League player as Kaba Diawara leads Guinea into the 2023 AFCON. The ex-Arsenal striker will look to improve on Guinea’s performance two years ago, when they were eliminated in the last 16 by The Gambia. The Syli National are appearing at their 14th AFCON, which is the most times a team has competed at the tournament without ever winning it. Star striker Serhou Guirassy will have been hoping to carry his outstanding German Bundesliga form into the tournament and fire his country to glory, which he still could, but he has been hampered heading into the tournament by an injury sustained in Guinea’s final warm-up game against Nigeria. A scan suggested it was only a minor strain, but Guirassy seems unlikely to line up against Cameroon. Coming into the tournament, Cameroon drew their only warm-up friendly 1-1 against Zambia, while Guinea beat Nigeria 2-0. This will be the third encounter between Cameroon and Guinea at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations, all taking place in the group stages. The two previous meetings ended in draws: 2-2 in 1998 and 1-1 in 2015. The 2015 clash saw Cameroon take the lead when Benjamin Moukandjo scored directly from a corner, before Ibrahima Traoré equalised from 20 yards just before half-time. Ahead of kick-off, Cameroon are predicted to win according to the Opta supercomputer. The Indomitable Lions have been given a 54.3% chance of victory, with Guinea judged to have a 23.3% likelihood of winning. The draw occurred in 22.4% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions suggested that Cameroon were seventh favourites to lift the trophy, doing so in 7.4% of simulations. Guinea won the tournament in just 1.5% of simulations, behind the likes of DR Congo, South Africa and Burkina Faso. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Cameroon: André Onana, Fabrice Ondoa, Dévis Epassy, Simon Ngapandouetnbu, Nouhou Tolo, Junior Tchamadeu, Oumar Gonzalez, Darlin Yongwa, Christopher Wooh, Harold Moukoudi, Jean-Charles Castelletto, Enzo Tchato, Malcom Bokélé, Yvan Neyou, Olivier Kemen, Frank Anguissa, Ben Elliott, Wilfried Nathan Douala, Olivier Ntcham, Karl Toko-Ekambi, Frank Magri, Vincent Aboubakar, Moumi Ngamaleu, Faris Moumbagna, Leonel Ateba, Georges-Kévin Nkoudou, Clinton N’Jie.

Look ahead with our Senegal vs Gambia prediction and preview. Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations title defence begins at Stade Charles Konan Banny in Yamoussoukro on Monday against their neighbours Gambia, who will be plotting a major upset as they hope to build on the positivity gleaned from their first ever AFCON appearance two years ago. The Lions of Teranga had almost become perennial underachievers at the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this century; despite producing an enviable amount of talent, it took them 17 years to reach another final after losing on penalties to Cameroon in their first ever appearance in the title match in 2002. In fact, 2006 aside, they didn’t even reach the semi-finals in that span. Defeat to Algeria in the 2019 final may not have been the outcome they’d hoped for, but it was a big step, and two years ago they finally ended their long wait to lift the trophy by beating Egypt on penalties. \\xa0 Now, they’re looking to do it all again after cruising through qualifying Group L ahead of Mozambique, Benin and Rwanda. They went unbeaten in that section, winning 14 points from their six games, with their two draws coming against Benin and Rwanda in the final two games after already confirming their qualification. Gambia, the smallest country in West Africa and one that is completely surrounded by Senegal bar its coast, don’t have a particularly extensive AFCON history but they’ve made real strides in youth development since the turn of the century and are beginning to reap the rewards with talented played like Yankuba Minteh now coming through. The last AFCON saw Gambia make their first ever appearance at the tournament and they defied the odds to go as far as the quarter-finals. A 2-0 defeat to Cameroon, for whom Karl Toko Ekambi scored a brace, ended their fairytale run, but it was a commendable effort that highlighted their progress in the world of international football. They reached AFCON 2023 after coming through the preliminary qualification phase and then finishing as runners-up to Mali in qualifying Group G above Congo and South Sudan. They won 10 points from their six games but finished with neutral goal difference, their qualification run characterised by narrow results such as the 3-2 win over South Sudan that was secured thanks to a 96th-minute winner from Hamza Barry. Gambia’s spot in Ivory Coast was confirmed on 10 September 2023 – only Cameroon and Namibia qualified later. As mentioned, this will only be Gambia’s second appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations; they didn’t cross paths with Senegal two years ago, instead coming up against Mauritania, Mali, Tunisia, Guinea and Cameroon, so this contest will be the first ever between the two neighbours at the AFCON. This will be their first official meeting in any competition at senior level since the 2016 CAF African Nations Championship preliminary round in 2015, with Senegal winning both legs of their tie (4-1 on aggregate). However, teams competing in the African Nations Championship can only field players from their national league competitions, meaning the competition carries little significance for many in comparison to the AFCON. Reigning champions Senegal are strongly backed by the Opta supercomputer to get their title defence off to a winning start at the 2023 AFCON. They won a whopping 65.7% of the pre-match simulations, making them the team most likely to win on Matchday 1. By comparison, Gambia are given just a 16.2% probability of taking all three points and putting a cat among the pigeons in the first round of matches. The draw is rated at 18.1%. Earlier in the week, our pre-AFCON 2023 tournament predictions made Senegal favourites to win the whole competition at 12.8%. If they were to go all the way, they’d be only the fourth nation to win the Africa Cup of Nations back-to-back after Ghana (1963 and 1965), Cameroon (2000 and 2002) and Egypt (2006, 2008 and 2010). Below are both sides’ current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Senegal: Mory Diaw, Seny Dieng, Édouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly, Youssouf Sabaly, Ismail Jakobs, Formose Mendy, Abdoulaye N’Diaye, Abdou Diallo, Fodé Ballo-Touré, Abdoulaye Seck, Moussa Niakhaté, Krépin Diatta, Idrissa Gueye, Pathé Ciss, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Nampalys Mendy, Lamine Camara, Pape Gueye, Pape Sarr, Sadio Mané, Habib Diallo, Nicolas Jackson, Boulaye Dia, Ismaïla Sarr, Iliman Ndiaye, Abdallah Sima.\\xa0 Coach: Aliou Cissé\\xa0 Gambia: Modou Jobe, Lamin Sarr, Baboucarr Gaye, Ibou Touray, Omar Colley, Bubacarr Sanneh, Saidy Janko, James Gomez, Noah Sonko Sundberg, Jacob Mendy, Muhammed Sanneh, Sulayman Marreh, Ablie Jallow, Dawda Ngum, Alasana Manneh, Yusupha Bobb, Hamza Barry, Ebou Adams, Ebrima Darboe, Assan Ceesay, Muhammed Badamosi, Abdoulie Sanyang, Musa Barrow, Ebrima Colley, Yankuba Minteh, Alieu Fadera, Ali Sowe.\\xa0 Coach: Tom Saintfiet\\xa0 Enjoy this?

Egypt get their CAF Africa Cup of Nations campaign under way on Sunday, hoping to go one better than their agonising runners-up finish two years ago. The Pharaohs were beaten in the final by Senegal on penalties in Cameroon, but Mohamed Salah and co. will want to make up for that and add to their nation’s record seven tournament wins, starting their quest with a Group B opener against Mozambique at Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan. Egypt qualified for AFCON 2023 by winning Group D ahead of Guinea, Malawi and Ethiopia. They finished with 15 points from six matches, only dropping points in a surprise loss to bottom place Ethiopia in June 2022 thanks to goals from Dawa Hotessa and Shimelis Bekele, before getting revenge in the reverse fixture in September last year. Captain Salah will be entering the tournament in particularly good form, having scored 14 goals in the Premier League this season for Liverpool, and 18 in all competitions, as well as recording eight assists. He also recently scored his 200th goal for the Reds, which allowed us to write about his incredible numbers since heading back to English football. Salah should not have the entire scoring burden on his shoulders for Egypt, though. Omar Marmoush is having a fine campaign in the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt, and though he might not be a guaranteed starter for his country, he has 15 goal involvements (12 goals, three assists) in all competitions at club level this season. That is already the same total as he managed for the previous two seasons combined. Mostafa Mohamed has also been impressing in Ligue 1 this season, scoring 14 goals in 2,977 minutes of French top-flight action. Only three forwards in the division have won more aerial duels since the start of 2022-23 than Mohamed (109), who also ranks third for headed goals (5) and fifth for headed shots (25).\\xa0 Egypt are the tournament’s most proficient team. This is their 26th appearance and, as mentioned, no country has won AFCON as often as their seven times, while they have been regular participants in the final in recent times, featuring in five of the last six. Rui Vitória’s side come into the tournament in good form too, having won eight of their 10 games in 2023. They also picked up a win in their solitary warm-up game against Tanzania last Sunday, with former Aston Villa winger Trézéguet opening the scoring before an own goal from goalkeeper Aishi Manula sealed it. Mozambique will be appearing at their fifth AFCON, though it is their first since 2010 when they again faced Egypt in the group stage, losing 2-0. They have finished bottom of their group in every previous tournament they have participated in. In fact, Mozambique are yet to register an AFCON win, which will undoubtedly be the target heading into this tournament. Chiquinho Conde’s team qualified for the finals ahead of Benin and Rwanda, which was seen as a huge achievement in itself back home, so it would be an incredible celebration in the country if they can find a victory in Ivory Coast.\\xa0 As mentioned in our AFCON Group B preview, 40-year-old Domingues is back for Mozambique, having played every game at the 2010 tournament. He is the country’s most-capped player with 106 appearances and the top scorer (16) among players who are still active. Mozambique played two games prior to the tournament, beating Lesotho 2-0 before a 1-1 draw against Botswana. One of their big hopes will be wideman Geny Catamo, who we selected as one of our players to watch ahead of the 2023 AFCON. This will be the fourth encounter between Egypt and Mozambique at the Africa Cup of Nations. The previous three meetings all produced a 2-0 group stage victory for Egypt in 1986, 1998 and 2010. That last clash was decided by an own goal from Dario Khan and a late second from substitute Mohamed Gedo, who also went on to score the winner in the final against Ghana as Egypt lifted the trophy that year. Ahead of kick-off, Egypt are heavily fancied to begin their 2023 AFCON campaign with a win by the Opta supercomputer. They won 62.4% of pre-match simulations, with just 18.3% won by Mozambique. Only 19.3% ended in a draw. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions handed Egypt an 8.5% chance of winning the competition behind Senegal, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Algeria. Mozambique were big outsiders, with just a 0.6% chance of going all the way, with only Angola and Namibia having a lower likelihood. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Egypt: Mohamed Abou Gabal, Mohamed Sobhi, Mohamed El Shenawy, Ahmed El Shenawy, Ahmed Samy, Ali Gabr, Mohamed Hany, Mohamed Hamdy, Yasser Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdelmonem, Omar Kamal, Ahmed Abou El Fotouh, Ahmed Hegazy, Trézéguet, Mohamed Elneny, Marwan Attia, Mahmoud Hamada, Hamdi Fathy, Emam Ashour, Mohanad Lasheen, Zizo, Mohamed Salah, Koka, Mostafa Fathi, Kahraba, Mostafa Mohamed, Omar Marmoush.

Expectations for Ghana are arguably at their lowest in a generation, with their performance at the last Africa Cup of Nations statistically their worst ever showing. They head into the 2023 edition eager to prove a point and that quest begins against Cape Verde at Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny on Sunday. The Black Stars should have enough quality in their squad to see them through a Group B that also contains record champions Egypt and Mozambique, but beyond that there’s real doubt about whether they can go deep into the tournament, with results over the past year or so seeing them drop out of Africa’s top 10 according to the FIFA rankings ahead of this tournament. Nevertheless, Chris Hughton’s side at least did enough to book their ticket to Ivory Coast, doing so as winners of qualifying Group E by finishing above Angola, Central African Republic and Madagascar. They went unbeaten in their group but drew all three away matches to finish with 12 points from their six games. This will be their 24th AFCON participation and have won the tournament four times, with only Egypt (7) and Cameroon (5) surpassing that. However, they’ve not won it since 1982, when they defeated hosts Libya 7-6 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the final. Two years ago, it felt like they were further away from glory than ever before. They didn’t make it out of their group, finishing bottom with a single point behind Morocco, Gabon and Comoros. It was a far cry from their run of reaching at least the semi-finals in all six AFCON tournaments between 2008 and 2017. Ghana’s opponents on Sunday, Cape Verde, will be competing in the tournament for the fourth time. Their best performance came in 2013 when they reached the quarter-finals before losing 2-0 to the Black Stars. They also reached the knockout stage of the 2021 edition, going out in the last 16 to eventual champions Senegal. Cape Verde qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in Group B ahead of Togo and Eswatini, finishing only one point behind section winners Burkina Faso. They amassed 10 points from their six games, with a late defeat to Togo in the final round of fixtures ultimately inconsequential for their qualification. That being said, given they went into Matchday 6 level on points with Burkina Faso, that defeat did deny the Islanders top spot. Ghana and Cape Verde have met just once before at the AFCON – after all, the latter had never even qualified for the tournament before 2013. As mentioned before, that past meeting came during Cape Verde’s debut campaign in 2013 as Ghana ran out 2-0 winners in the quarter-finals. A Mubarak Wakaso double – the clincher coming in the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time – earned the Black Stars a 2-0 victory at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Ghana are backed to begin their 2023 AFCON campaign with a victory by the Opta supercomputer. They won 53.8% of the pre-match simulations, compared to 23.6% going the way of Cape Verde and 22.6% ending in a draw. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Ghana going all the way and lifting the trophy in 5.3% of scenarios – that made them ninth favourites, which tallies fairly closely with them being ranked 11th on the continent by FIFA. Below you’ll find the current, up-to-date chances of progression for both teams all the way through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer.

We look ahead to it with our Nigeria vs Equatorial Guinea prediction and preview. After Friday night’s tournament-opener between Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, AFCON 2023 continues on Saturday with the second match in Group A, as Nigeria take on Equatorial Guinea. Nigeria are AFCON veterans. This is their 20th appearance at the competition, and they have won it three times, with only three teams having won it more. They last won it in 2013, though, when they defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in the final, and have only made it as far as the semi-finals on one occasion since (2019). However, the last time the tournament was held in the Ivory Coast in 1984, they made it to the final, where they were beaten by Cameroon. The 1980s and 1990s were an AFCON golden era for the Super Eagles, as they included a run of eight tournaments in which Nigeria reached the final on five occasions. Since their 1994 triumph, however, they have only made it to the final twice in 14 AFCON tournaments. Nigeria qualified for AFCON 2023 as winners of Group A, ahead of Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and São Tomé and Príncipe. They finished the group with 15 points from their six games, with a loss to Guinea-Bissau representing the only points they dropped across their qualifying campaign. Victor Osimhen was their key man, ending as the top goalscorer across all of AFCON qualifying, netting 10 times – twice as many as any other player – leading Nigeria to the best goal difference of any team (+22). Despite him scoring so many goals, Nigeria still had more different goalscorers (10) than any other team in AFCON qualifying. Given that their last appearance at AFCON in 2021 ended with a surprise round of 16 defeat at the hands of Burkina Faso, they will be hoping that their strong showing in qualifying precipitates a better tournament this time around. Equatorial Guinea, meanwhile, are playing in only their second AFCON tournament in which they have made it through qualifying rather than as hosts (their fourth tournament overall, having hosted twice – in 2012 and 2015). They qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in their group, beaten to top spot by Tunisia only on goal difference. They finished the group with 13 points from six matches, with their only defeat a 4-0 loss to Tunisia, also dropping points to Libya in a 1-1 draw in the final round of fixtures, which ultimately allowed Tunisia to leapfrog them and win the group. Having made at least the quarter-final on each of their three previous AFCON appearances, Equatorial Guinea will hope to build on what was a decent showing in qualifying. They were quarter-finalists last time out in 2021, so may hold hope of at least a repeat of that performance. This will be the first encounter between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea at the Africa Cup of Nations. They did, however, meet in qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with Nigeria winning both matches without conceding a goal (1-0 and 2-0). According to the Opta supercomputer, Nigeria are predicted to get their 2023 AFCON campaign off to a positive start, winning this match in 59.0% of pre-match simulations. Just 20.4% were won by Equatorial Guinea, leaving 20.6% of simulations to end in a draw. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Nigeria as the sixth favourites to win the competition. They won AFCON 2023 in 8.0% of the supercomputer’s simulations, behind favourites Senegal, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Algeria and Egypt. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Nigeria: Olorunleke Ojo, Stanley Nwabali, Francis Uzoho, Kenneth Omeruo, William Troost-Ekong, Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Alhassan Yusuf, Raphael Onyedika, Joe Aribo, Frank Onyeka, Moses Simon, Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, Terem Moffi, Ademola Lookman, Umar Sadiq.

How will they fare against the Premier League’s surprise title challengers? We look ahead to Sunday’s game at Goodison Park with our Everton vs Aston Villa prediction and preview. Everton seemed to be looking up when they started December with four successive victories, pulling clear of the Premier League’s bottom three and clawing back the 10 points they were deducted with interest. However, three defeats over the festive period have dragged the Toffees back into the relegation conversation, and things don’t get any easier for them on Sunday as they face surprise title challengers Aston Villa. Everton approached their trip to Tottenham on 23 December seven points clear of the bottom three, but defeats to Spurs (2-1), Manchester City (3-1) and Wolves (3-0) – as well as Luton Town’s resurgence – have seen that buffer cut to one point, and the Opta supercomputer now assigns the Toffees a 17.1% chance of relegation. Sean Dyche’s side stopped the rot in the third round of the FA Cup last week, holding Crystal Palace to a goalless draw at Selhurst Park despite Dominic Calvert-Lewin controversially receiving the first red card of his career. The Toffees have since won an appeal against the striker’s dismissal, so he avoids a three-match ban and will be eligible to face Villa. Calvert-Lewin has gone nine league games without a goal since netting Everton’s winner against West Ham in October. He has just three Premier League goals from an expected goals (xG) total of 6.92 this season – no player in the competition has underperformed their xG figures by a greater margin. Dyche will hope to provide the striker with more support on Sunday, with Abdoulaye Doucouré – Everton’s top scorer with six league goals this season – closing in on a return after almost a month out injured. Dwight McNeil is out after suffering an ankle injury last week and Idrissa Gueye is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, but Ashley Young could be available to face his former club. Everton may have plenty of defending to do against a team that routed them 4-0 in August’s return fixture, and they will again lean heavily on the experience of James Tarkowski. Since Dyche’s first game in charge of the Toffees in February 2023, Tarkowski has blocked the most shots of any Premier League player (62), while ranking second for clearances (174) and third for headed clearances (98). He also topped the charts for all three metrics between the start of 2017-18 and 10 April 2022, when playing under Dyche for Burnley (236 blocks, 967 clearances, 571 headed clearances). Tarkowski and company have a job on their hands to keep Villa quiet, with Unai Emery’s team having won 85 Premier League points throughout 2023, putting them second only to Man City (93). Emery is averaging 2.02 points-per-game with Villa (91 points from 45 matches), and he is currently the only manager in Premier League history to average over two points per game across 40+ matches with a team without leading them to the title. Might that change in 2024? With Liverpool not in action until January 21 as the Premier League observes its staggered winter break, Villa know a victory at Goodison Park will take them level with Jürgen Klopp’s leaders. They had to ride their luck somewhat in their last league outing, beating 10-man Burnley 3-2 at Villa Park as Douglas Luiz converted a contentious 89th-minute penalty. It’s often said that those moments can define title races, though, and Villa have now scored seven Premier League goals in the 89th minute or later this season, a tally only matched by Liverpool. Leon Bailey and Moussa Diaby were also on target in that match, with Ollie Watkins laying on goals for both. Watkins’ 17 Premier League goal involvements (nine goals, eight assists) in 2023-24 are only bettered by Mohamed Salah (22) and Erling Haaland (18), and he is just the fifth different English player with at least eight goals and eight assists through 20 games of a Premier League season, and the first since Harry Kane in 2020-21 (12 goals, 11 assists). It was another late show for Villa in the FA Cup last week, as Matty Cash’s deflected 87th-minute strike handed them a 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough, with their first FA Cup win since 2016 teeing up a fourth-round trip to Chelsea. Villa could have Pau Torres and Youri Tielemans available for Sunday’s game, though former Everton left-back Lucas Digne is not expected back until later this month after suffering a thigh injury. The reverse fixture represented one of the low points of Everton’s season as they were hammered 4-0 at Villa Park on Matchday 2, with John McGinn and Jhon Durán joining Luiz and Bailey on the scoresheet. Villa have had Everton’s number since returning to the Premier League in 2019, going unbeaten in their nine league meetings in that span (seven wins, two draws), winning the last five in a row. Everton have also lost their last three home league matches against Villa, as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 19 (seven wins, nine draws). Overall, Everton have struggled to match the Premier League’s elite under Dyche. Since beating a table-topping Arsenal side 1-0 in his first match in charge last February, the Toffees are winless in nine league games against teams starting the day inside the top six (one draw, eight defeats), losing their last seven in a row. However, the Toffees did dump Villa out of the EFL Cup last September, with James Garner and Calvert-Lewin scoring in a 2-1 win at Villa Park. Having endured a miserable festive period, Everton are looking to avoid losing four successive Premier League games for the first time since doing so in March 2022 under Frank Lampard. Dyche, meanwhile, last lost four in a row in the competition with Burnley in April 2022. He was sacked shortly after that run. Perhaps Villa’s away record might inspire some hope for the Toffees, though. While Emery’s team have collected a league-high 28 points at home this term, they have only won four of their 10 away games (two draws, four defeats), losing 3-2 at Manchester United on Boxing Day on their last road trip despite holding a 2-0 lead.  Villa will be hoping to carry their 2023 form into 2024. They won 26 league games last year, the second-most in one calendar year throughout their league history, having won 28 matches in 1972 when playing in the second and third tiers.

For a quick primer on how they’re calculated,\\xa0you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Vitaliy Mykolenko: 69.1 (out of 100)James Tarkowski: 65.3Dwight McNeil: 65.0Abdoulaye Doucouré: 65.0Amadou Onana: 63.1 Douglas Luiz: 73.2 (out of 100)Ollie Watkins: 72.9John McGinn: 72.8Leon Bailey: 71.8Ezri Konsa: 71.4 While Villa have won most of their points at home this term, the Opta supercomputer makes them favourites for an away win on Matchday 21. Of 10,000 match simulations conducted before kick-off, Villa won 40.2%, with Everton victorious in 30.6% and 29.2% finishing level. In the supercomputer’s season predictions, Villa’s title hopes are currently rated at 2.5%, behind those of City (56.6%), Liverpool (37%) and Arsenal (3.4%). Emery’s men do look good for UEFA Champions League qualification, though, securing a top-four finish in 72.1% of simulations.  Everton’s current position of 17th (23.8%) is their most common across our projections, with Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton Town still seen as the most likely trio to suffer the drop.

For every step forward under Erik ten Hag, Manchester United seem to take another back as they continue to struggle from a stop-start undertone to their underwhelming Premier League campaign that next sees them welcome Tottenham – buoyed by two new signings – to Old Trafford on Sunday. Festive celebrations were few and far between for manager Ten Hag over another busy December period as his side were defeated by West Ham United and Nottingham Forest, either side of a 3-2 comeback triumph over Unai Emery’s in-form Aston Villa. It was a perfect microcosm of United’s season, an insipid loss followed by an inspiring win and then another dour defeat. From 10,000 season simulations ahead of the 2023-24 campaign, Opta’s predictions suggested United would finish fourth – guaranteeing another season of UEFA Champions League football at least – but the reality has been much harsher. Ten Hag’s men sit eighth in the league table heading into Matchday 21, nine points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal and eight behind Tottenham, whose fifth-place position could be enough to secure Champions League qualification depending on how other English sides fare in Europe this term. A 2-0 victory over League One’s Wigan Athletic courtesy of goals from Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes in Monday’s FA Cup third-round tie will have raised spirits somewhat, but pressure continues to mount on Ten Hag, who may need to act in the January transfer window to arrest a disappointing spell of returns during his second season in Manchester. United will be without midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, though, with the Moroccan away at the African Cup of Nations. Jadon Sancho has also completed a return to former side Borussia Dortmund, signing on a loan until the end of the season with no option to buy after a period of exile following a disagreement with Ten Hag. The hosts will at least be boosted by some positive news on the injury front, as Ten Hag confirmed at his press conference on Friday that Casemiro, Lisandro Martínez, Luke Shaw, Antony, Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen are all back in training. As frustrations continue to rise at Old Trafford, former Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou has taken to life at Tottenham with relative ease. Spurs are just six points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after MD 20, while they trail second-placed Villa by three and Manchester City, in third, by only one. Postecoglou’s men suffered a festive setback after a 4-2 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion, a result perhaps understating their poor performance due to late goals from Alejo Véliz and Ben Davies, but they responded with a 3-1 triumph over Bournemouth on New Year’s Eve as Pape Sarr, Son Heung-min and Richarlison scored before Pedro Porro proved the difference in the FA Cup third-round win against Burnley. Son has since departed for the Asian Cup with South Korea, while Senegal’s Sarr and Mali’s Yves Bissouma will compete at the African Cup of Nations. Postecoglou also has James Maddison, Davies, Cristian Romero, Manor Solomon, Veliz and Ivan Perisic out injured as fitness problems persist at Spurs, who will decide on the availability of centre-back Radu Dragusin after beating Bayern Munich to his signature from Genoa. Richarlison has scored five goals in his last five Premier League games – against Newcastle United (two), Forest, Everton and Bournemouth – as many as his previous 45 appearances in the competition beforehand and would have been expected to step up in Son’s absence. However, the Brazilian has only one goal in 10 league appearances against Manchester United, scoring for Everton in April 2019. Postecoglou could therefore turn to another new arrival in Timo Werner after the former Chelsea striker joined from RB Leipzig on loan until the end of the season. The Germany international, whose deal includes an option to buy for a reported £15 million, only scored 10 goals in 56 Premier League games for the Blues but Postecoglou will be hoping the forward can add some much-needed firepower, starting at Old Trafford on Sunday. As for other team news for the visitors, Ben Davies will miss up to a month with a hamstring problem while Giovani Lo Celso is also out with a muscle strain. However, Cristian Romero could return on Sunday after recovering from a hamstring issue. Tottenham are looking to complete their first league double over Man Utd since the 1989-90 campaign, having won 2-0 thanks to Pape Sarr’s finish and a Lisandro Martínez own goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the reverse fixture in August. With a victory on Sunday, not only could Tottenham inflict another top-four blow to their hosts, but Postecoglou would become the first Spurs manager to win both of his first two games against Manchester United with the club in all competitions. However, Ten Hag’s men will fancy stopping their visitors as no team has won more home games against an opponent in Premier League history than United’s 24 against Spurs (level with Arsenal against Everton). Meanwhile, expect both teams to go for blow-for-blow in this one considering none of the last 17 Premier League meetings between United and Tottenham at Old Trafford have finished level, with the Red Devils winning 13 of them (L4). United finished 2023 with defeat against Nottingham Forest but they haven’t lost their last game of a calendar year, and then their first league game of the following year since 2011-12 (defeats to Blackburn and Newcastle). However, Ten Hag’s men have lost nine of their 20 Premier League games this season, as many defeats as they suffered in the whole of last season. There have been just four Premier League campaigns where they’ve lost 10+ games (2013-14, 2015-16, 2018-19 and 2021-22), with 2015-16 the only one of those where they didn’t change their manager during the season. Postecoglou’s men continue to fire on all fronts regardless of injury struggles, with the Brighton defeat Spurs’ only blemish in their last five league games after defeating Newcastle, Forest, Everton and Bournemouth. Expect at least one goal from the visitors, too, as Tottenham have scored in each of their last 32 Premier League games, the longest ongoing run of any side in the competition. It is their joint-longest scoring run in league history, also scoring in 32 in a row from April to December 1949 and February to November 1962.

Tottenham have a 36.8% chance of finishing in the UEFA Champions League spots, albeit fifth place – their current position that could still be enough – occurs the most often in 32.6% of season simulations. Meanwhile, United’s top-four prediction sits at just a meagre 1%, with ninth – one behind their current league-table standing – the most likely finish at 18.9% from Opta’s 10,000 data-led scenarios.

We look ahead to Saturday’s late kick-off with our Newcastle vs Manchester City prediction and preview. It’s fair to say 2023 was a good year for Manchester City, and as Pep Guardiola’s treble winners approach their first Premier League game of 2024, it’s starting to feel like more success is around the corner this year. With City starting to click into gear, boosted by the return of key players and the missteps of their rivals, are out-of-form Newcastle United set for a difficult outing on Saturday? City have been immaculate since their successful trip to the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, reeling off Premier League wins over Everton (3-1) and Sheffield United (2-0) before routing Huddersfield Town 5-0 in the FA Cup last Sunday. Largely owing to Arsenal‘s recent drop-off, City’s chances of retaining their league title rose by 18% between 20 December and 3 January, according to the Opta supercomputer, and they are one of just three Premier League teams who have not lost any players to the Africa Cup of Nations or Asian Cup tournaments for the coming weeks. Though the likes of Rodri, Ederson, Kyle Walker and Nathan Aké were rested, Guardiola did go strong for last week’s FA Cup third-round tie against the Terriers, and he was rewarded with a dominant win featuring a Phil Foden brace as well as goals from Julián Álvarez and Jérémy Doku. Foden has also been in fine form in the Premier League, involved in seven goals in his last 10 appearances in the competition (four goals, three assists). Since Christmas, Foden leads all players in the league for chances created from open play (nine), and he produced a mesmerising performance in City’s last league meeting with Newcastle, creating seven open-play chances as his team triumphed 1-0 at home in August. One huge positive from last week’s cup win was Kevin De Bruyne’s return from injury, as the Belgian laid on Doku’s goal on his first appearance in almost five months, recording his 30th assist across all competitions since the start of last season. Despite De Bruyne only playing three games this term, his 30 assists is the most of any player from Europe’s top five leagues since the start of 2022-23, with Mohamed Salah second on 24. While De Bruyne and Doku are back in the reckoning, City must assess Erling Haaland, who is nearing a return to fitness after suffering a foot injury in early December. Bernardo Silva was ill last week but should be back on Tyneside, though John Stones remains a major doubt. Guardiola will want City to make a better start than they managed in their last two away league games – comeback wins over Luton Town and Everton. Only three teams have previously won three straight Premier League away games when conceding first in each: Leeds United in 1999, Tottenham in 2013 and Manchester United in 2020 (a run of six). Newcastle, meanwhile, endured a far less productive festive period and have lost six of their last nine Premier League matches (three wins), only one fewer defeat than they suffered in their previous 44 (24 wins, 13 draws, seven losses). After going down to Luton, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, they could lose four successive league games for the first time since January 2021 (a run of five). City, meanwhile, have only lost one of their last 32 league games against teams on losing runs of three or more matches, winning 22 and drawing nine. However, the Magpies eased the pressure on boss Eddie Howe with a commanding 3-0 FA Cup victory over local rivals Sunderland last week, with Alexander Isak netting twice after Dan Ballard put through his own net for the Black Cats. Isak has now scored in three straight games for the second time this campaign, while his total of 13 goals in 22 matches across all competitions this season is two more than he netted in 29 appearances throughout 2022-23 (for Real Sociedad and Newcastle combined). While Newcastle should be in high spirits after their first Tyne-Wear derby win since August 2011, they suffered yet another injury blow at the Stadium of Light, with Joelinton sustaining a thigh issue. The Brazilian joins Jacob Murphy, Callum Wilson, Joe Willock, Harvey Barnes, Elliot Anderson, Matt Targett and Nick Pope on a lengthy injury list. Newcastle will need a far better defensive performance than they managed on their last league outing, having allowed a Premier League-record 7.11 expected goals (xG) in a 4-2 defeat at Liverpool. Martin Dúbravka made 10 saves at Anfield but it wasn’t enough for the visitors, who have lost five of their seven league games (one win, one draw) without first-choice stopper Pope in the last two seasons. Newcastle have a truly dismal record against City, who have won more games (30), scored more goals (98) and kept more clean sheets (22) against the Magpies than versus any other club in their Premier League history. Indeed, Saturday’s hosts have only won one of their last 32 Premier League matches against City (five draws, 26 defeats), a 2-1 victory at St James’ in January 2019. City have also scored in each of their last 30 Premier League games against Newcastle, the longest scoring streak one side has managed against another in the competition’s history. In English top-flight history, the last team to score in more consecutive matches against a single opponent was Chelsea, who netted in 37 games straight against Newcastle between 1933 and 1969. City were, however, shut out when the teams met on this ground in the third round of the EFL Cup in September, falling to a 1-0 defeat. Newcastle could now beat the Citizens twice in the same season for the first time since 1983-84. Only Aston Villa (28) and Liverpool (26) have bettered Newcastle’s return of 24 points at home in the Premier League this season, Howe’s men winning eight and losing two on Tyneside. They were, however, beaten 3-1 by Forest last time out at St James’ Park, and they could now suffer back-to-back home defeats for the first time under Howe. Across all competitions, City have won their last five games since squandering a two-goal lead in a 2-2 home draw against Crystal Palace in mid-December. Guardiola’s team have also taken 19 points from their 10 away Premier League matches this season (six wins, one draw, three defeats), a tally only matched by title rivals Liverpool.\\xa0 The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world.

Of 10,000 match simulations conducted before kick-off, City won 55.2%, with Newcastle triumphing in 19.4% of scenarios and 25.4% finishing level. In our season predictions, City are back to being title favourites. They retain their crown in 57.5% of the supercomputer’s simulations, ahead of Liverpool (36.5%), Arsenal (3.4%) and Villa (2.1%). Newcastle have slipped 11 points adrift of the top four and are now considered outsiders for UEFA Champions League qualification. They have just a 1.2% chance of a top-four finish and a 3.9% likelihood of finishing fifth, with eighth (18.8%) now their most common position in our projections. Enjoy this?

It was a day to forget for Raheem Sterling and Chelsea on Matchday 2 of the 2023-24 Premier League season as they went down 3-1 to West Ham at London Stadium. However, there was the slimmest of silver linings, for Sterling at least. A goal-fest in May 2023 between Fulham and Leicester City saw two penalties, the first of which was won by Jamie Vardy, which had drawn the veteran striker level with Sterling as the player with the most spot-kicks earned in Premier League history. However, Sterling forcing a foul from West Ham’s Tomáš Souček with the score at 1-1 in the August 2023 game put him back in front of Vardy. Since then, he distanced himself even further, winning two more penalties for Chelsea against Burnley (October 2023) and Fulham (January 2024), taking his total penalties won in Premier League history to 26.  Vardy will have to wait a while to hunt down Sterling’s total again, currently back in the Championship with Leicester. However, while the 36-year-old has won all 23 of his penalties for one club, Sterling’s 26 are split between his time at Liverpool (four) Manchester City (19), and now Chelsea (three). Nineteen for one club puts Sterling joint-second with Wilfried Zaha who has won all 19 of his for Crystal Palace. Of current Premier League players, Mohamed Salah and Danny Welbeck (both 13) and Ashley Young (12) are the ones closest to entering the top five.  It’s no surprise to see all three of Sterling, Zaha and Vardy feature in the list for most penalties won in a single season in the Premier League, but they all trail Andrew Johnson of Crystal Palace who earned eight in the 2004-05 campaign. Despite all those spot-kicks, Palace were actually relegated that season. The Eagles won 12 penalties in total that campaign, which was a joint-league high until Leicester in 2015-16 surpassed that tally, helped by Vardy. But the Foxes’ tally was pushed into second place in 2019-20 when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United side won an incredible 14 penalties in one campaign, after having earned 12 in the season before. Bournemouth had an unwanted achievement at the other end of the scale in 2022-23, when they became just the ninth team to fail to win a single penalty in a Premier League season. Every other team in 2022-23 won at least three penalties, with the introduction of VAR surely making spot-kicks even more likely, but Bournemouth, unfortunately for them, were not handed even one spot-kick. It makes their unlikely survival that season even more impressive. Enjoy this?\\xa0Subscribe\\xa0to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

Now that he’s back, how much of a difference can the Belgium international make? You’ve all played those computer games where you’re up against the final boss, who looks vulnerable and on the cusp of being vanquished, before they find another weapon from somewhere and knock you back down again. That must be how Manchester City’s rivals feel having worked so hard to edge ahead of the defending Premier League champions, only to see the ominous figure (and fantastic hair) of Kevin De Bruyne return from injury. Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering side have wobbled in recent times, allowing for Liverpool, Arsenal and even Aston Villa to threaten the status quo, which for five of the last six seasons has been City at the top of the tree. When De Bruyne came off with a hamstring injury against Burnley in the opening game of the Premier League season, it provided an intriguing possibility. How would Man City manage without their creator-in-chief for half the season? Initially, they were fine, winning their first six Premier League games as well as the UEFA Super Cup. Defeat at Newcastle United in the EFL Cup was followed by back-to-back Premier League losses at Wolves and Arsenal, though, before an even longer run of dropped points in November and December. City won just one out of six league games prior to the FIFA Club World Cup (D4 L1), seeing them lose their grip on the top spot. Victories against Everton and Sheffield United post-Christmas have taken them back up into third place in the Premier League, though, ahead of Arsenal on goal difference and five points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand. Now, following De Bruyne’s return from the bench in the FA Cup third round thrashing of Huddersfield Town – including an obligatory assist – City look ready to do as they so often do and put their foot down in the second half of the season; starting with a repeat of the first fixture they failed to win following De Bruyne’s injury. Return of the 👑It's good to have you back on the pitch, @KevinDeBruyne \\U0001fa75 pic.twitter.com/kAc4N01h3p A trip to Newcastle on Saturday could be a tricky prospect for the defending champions, having lost 1-0 there in the EFL Cup earlier this season, and with Eddie Howe’s side boasting the third-best home record in the division in 2023-24. But with their brilliant Belgian available again it could be a different story this time for Manchester City. So, how much have they missed De Bruyne? It’s no secret that he’s a creative fellow. On Man City’s way to the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League treble last season, De Bruyne played 49 games, created 137 chances, 99 from open play, and created 44 big chances (a chance from which the attacking team would usually be expected to score). His 28 assists was eight more than the player with the next most from Europe’s top five leagues (Lionel Messi – 20), 12 more than any other Premier League player (Mohamed Salah – 16) and 15 more than any other City player, which was Riyad Mahrez (13) who left for the Saudi Pro League at the end of last season. Of the remaining City players, Jack Grealish recorded the next most assists in all competitions last season (11) but the most significant discrepancy was in big chances created. As mentioned, De Bruyne was directly responsible for 44 in all competitions in 2022-23, almost three times more than the next most for City, which was Grealish (16). That shows how much creativity was being lost when De Bruyne trudged off injured at Turf Moor. But did it really impact City’s ability to make chances and score goals, or did others step up in his absence? On average last season, De Bruyne created 3.4 chances per 90 minutes, with 2.4 from open play, 1.1 big chances and 0.7 assists. City have spread the wealth more this season, though, with their top performer for chances created per 90 (not including De Bruyne’s three appearances) being Julián Álvarez (2.8), while Grealish leads for chances created from open play per 90 (2.4 – matching De Bruyne from last season) and Jérémy Doku is top for assists per 90 (0.6). Nevertheless, City eased through their Champions League group and were untroubled on their way to winning the FIFA Club World Cup last month, so let’s look specifically at the Premier League. At the halfway point of this season, Man City have scored 45 goals (2.4 per game), had 311 shots (16.4 per game) and created 49 big chances (2.6 per game). Compare that to last season, when they scored 94 goals (2.5 per game), had 600 shots (15.8 per game) and created 103 big chances (2.7 per game). So, City are more or less scoring as many and have actually had slightly more chances per game, although it should be noted that De Bruyne did also miss six of their 38 league games last season. (The graphics below exclude own goals) Their ability at working shots inside the box is also pretty much identical, suggesting they aren’t having many problems working their way through low blocks. City had 410 shots in the penalty area last season in the Premier League (10.8 per game) and have had 202 so far this term (10.6 per game), but their expected goals (xG) have gone down slightly from 2.12 per game in 2022-23 to 1.97 in 2023-24, perhaps indicating the quality of chances being created hasn’t been quite as good on average. There is little question that Man City are a better team with De Bruyne in the team, but his return should not necessarily be seen as a significant needle mover. Since the start of last season, City have played 33 league games with De Bruyne and 24 without. On average, they have scored 2.5 goals with him and 2.4 without, conceded 0.8 goals with and 1.1 without, and have won 2.3 points per game with and 2.2 without. One person who should be very pleased to see De Bruyne back is Erling Haaland. Last season saw eight of Haaland’s Premier League goals assisted by De Bruyne – only three players have created more goals for a single teammate within a Premier League season. The Norwegian has still fired in the goals this season but is averaging 0.92 goals per game in all competitions, down from 1.13 last season. Having said that, even without the Belgian’s presence, Haaland has been averaging more shots per 90 this season (4.2, up from 3.9) has had slightly more big chances per 90 (2.0, up from 1.9) and has a marginally higher xG per 90 (0.98, up from 0.94). It may not be a shock to learn that De Bruyne led the way for City in terms of attacking sequence involvements per 90 in the Premier League last season (7.2), ahead of second-place Rodri (6.5) (minimum 360 minutes). Of those to have played at least 180 minutes this season, Rodri is out in front with an impressive 8.2 per 90, while Grealish is just behind with 8.0. Doku has almost matched De Bruyne’s total from last year at 7.1 per 90, while Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Álvarez are each on 6.7, all more than they managed last season. This shows how much several of City’s players have stepped up while De Bruyne has been out. The former Chelsea and Wolfsburg man could potentially make his most significant contribution in the second half of the season in the big games, though. Among City’s slips in the first half of the campaign were 1-0 defeats away to Arsenal and Aston Villa and a 1-1 home draw with Liverpool. In the corresponding fixtures last season, De Bruyne recorded a goal and an assist in both comfortable wins against Arsenal (3-1) and Liverpool (4-1), while he assisted Haaland in a 1-1 draw at Villa. His numbers speak for themselves, and who knows? Perhaps City having to manage without him means others will continue to step up even when De Bruyne is regularly back in the team, taking some of the burden off his shoulders and even allowing him to be eased back in rather than rushed. There is no question Guardiola would rather have De Bruyne available to him than not, and he could well be the catalyst for a charge to another title (and perhaps even another treble) over the next few months. The City boss said after the win over Huddersfield: “Kevin needs to accumulate training sessions, training sessions and more training sessions – even more than games… Now with Newcastle [next weekend] we have another chance, then we have two weeks to have good training sessions here and in Abu Dhabi [during the winter break], so we are ready for the second part of the season. “But I am incredibly happy to have him back because Kevin helps you to win games.” The question is, can he help Man City win enough games from here to make it six Premier League titles in seven seasons?

Can the Blues make it three league wins on the spin? Chelsea will put cup commitments to one side as Mauricio Pochettino’s team aim to make it three straight Premier League wins when they host fellow EFL Cup semi-finalists Fulham at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Blues swept aside Preston North End with a 4-0 demolition in their FA Cup third-round tie last weekend but suffered a disappointing 1-0 loss away at Championship side Middlesbrough in their EFL Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday. Chelsea will look to bounce back in the Premier League, though, where they have recently recorded back-to-back victories over Crystal Palace and Luton Town. A fine Cole Palmer double, coupled with the former Manchester City man’s assist for Noni Madueke’s goal at Kenilworth Road, seemed to have Pochettino’s visitors easing to a routine victory on Matchday 20 against Luton, but then Ross Barkley and Elijah Adebayo scored to set up a tense finale, though Chelsea held out for a 3-2 triumph. Owing to a turgid start to the season, however, the Stamford Bridge club sit 10th in the league table heading into MD 21 – some four places below Opta’s sixth-place prediction for Chelsea from 10,000 Premier League campaign simulations ahead of the 2023-24 campaign – with it clear for all to see that Pochettino still has a lot of work to do. The former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain boss may apportion some of the struggles to injury issues amid his attempts to knit together a plethora of big-money signings – and expect further Todd Boehly activity in the January transfer window – as Pochettino’s lineup remains without a host of key figures. Wesley Fofana, Reece James, Marc Cucurella, Robert Sánchez, Carney Chukwuemeka and Trevoh Chalobah are all long-term absentees, while Christopher Nkunku suffered another setback with a hip injury. Ben Chilwell and Benoît Badiashille are back in full-team training ahead of Saturday’s kick-off, though. With those injury troubles, Pochettino may look to the increasingly reliable Palmer as his chief creative asset. The English attacking midfielder squandered two brilliant opportunities against Middlesbrough in Tuesday’s EFL Cup semi-final but has scored eight Premier League goals this season, more than any of his Chelsea teammates. The only player to score more in a single campaign for the Blues in the competition while aged 21 or younger is Christian Pulisic in 2019-20 (nine). Fulham have had similar commitments to Chelsea outside of league football in the last week, defeating Rotherham United 1-0 in their FA Cup third-round tie thanks to Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s goal, before losing 2-1 at Liverpool in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final clash on Wednesday. Marco Silva’s men claimed a 2-1 win over top-flight title contenders Arsenal in their last Premier League outing on New Year’s Eve as Raúl Jiménez and De Cordova-Reid powered the hosts to a comeback victory at Craven Cottage after Bukayo Saka’s early opener. The 31 December triumph over Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal was a welcome return to form for Fulham, whose 13th-place league-table position before MD 21 owes to a run of three straight league defeats – against Bournemouth, Burnley and Newcastle United – prior to their win over the Gunners.  As for Fulham’s team news, Silva’s lineup will be somewhat depleted for the Stamford Bridge trip, with Nigerian pair Calvin Bassey and Alex Iwobi as well as Senegal’s Fodé Ballo-Touré on international duty at the African Cup of Nations. The west-London visit will likely be too soon for Adama Traoré too, though Tim Ream was back on the bench at Anfield on Wednesday. Chelsea will fancy their chances here considering they are unbeaten in their last 18 home league games against Fulham (W11 D7) since a 2-0 loss in the second tier in October 1979. Continue to look away Fulham fans… the Cottagers have won just one of their last 23 Premier League games against Chelsea (D8 L14) overall, though that was a 2-1 success at home last January. Indeed, Fulham’s 10% win rate against Chelsea (8 wins from 77 meetings) is the lowest of the 3,116 occasions of a side facing another at least 50 times in English league history. The Blues were also 2-0 victors in the reverse fixture this term as Mykhailo Mudryk and Armando Broja found the net. Pochettino, across spells with Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, has enjoyed facing Fulham in his managerial career, winning all five of his Premier League meetings against them – only against Hull City (six from six) does he have a better 100% win rate in the competition. It has been another turbulent season for Chelsea but they have won their last two Premier League games – against Crystal Palace and Luton – last winning three in a row in October 2022 (a run of four). Pochettino’s men can also rely on home comforts given they have also won their last three – including against Sheffield United and Brighton and Hove Albion –\\xa0 at Stamford Bridge in the competition, but they have not managed four in succession on home soil since a six-game run in July 2020. Adding in a chaotic 4-1 win over Tottenham in November, Chelsea have won their last two Premier League London derbies, as many as they had in their previous 13 such games (D4 L7), but Fulham are also looking to win three consecutive top-flight London derbies for the first time since April 2013. However, Fulham have lost each of their last four Premier League away games – against Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Aston Villa – while conceding 3+ goals in each. Only two sides have lost five in a row on the road in the Premier League while shipping three or more goals each time – Ipswich Town in April 1995 and Barnsley in November 1997.

For a quick primer on how they’re calculated,\\xa0you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Conor Gallagher: 75.0 (out of 100) Thiago Silva: 72.5Raheem Sterling: 70.4Cole Palmer: 68.4Moisés Caicedo: 68.0 Tom Cairney: 75.1 (out of 100) Willian: 65.8Alex Iwobi: 64.7Bernd Leno: 64.6Harry Wilson: 63.4 Dictated by their dominant head-to-head record, Chelsea are backed by the Opta supercomputer to defeat Fulham, winning 49.7% of 10,000 simulations before kick-off. A draw may be Fulham’s best hope, with the data-backed predictions producing that result in 27.7% of simulations, while an away win comes in at just a 22.6% chance, though Fulham will take heart from their strong showing at Anfield on Wednesday, albeit in defeat. Despite the likelihood of a home win here, Chelsea are still expected to finish 10th – their current league-table position – in 20.2% of season simulations, while Fulham’s most likely end-of-season standing ranks as 13th in 20.2% of Opta simulations.

We look ahead to Friday’s game at Turf Moor with our Burnley vs Luton prediction and preview. With FA Cup third-round weekend done and dusted, the Premier League returns for a staggered Matchday 21 as half the competition’s teams take a winter break. There are still plenty of intriguing contests taking place, though, starting on Friday as Burnley face Luton Town at Turf Moor in a match which could have huge ramifications for both teams’ survival hopes. With 17th-placed Everton not in action until Sunday, when they host Aston Villa, second-from-bottom Burnley know they will move within two points of safety with a win. However, Vincent Kompany’s side are coming off a frustrating festive period, having suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats against Liverpool (2-0) and Aston Villa (3-2) since beating Fulham 2-0 on 23 December. Burnley produced a gallant performance against Tottenham in the FA Cup last Friday, but Pedro Porro’s stunning strike was the difference, with Zeki Amdouni missing a glaring chance to send the tie to a replay at the death. Kompany’s men are now able to focus purely on their survival bid, though they must improve their home form if they are to have any chance of avoiding the drop. Burnley have lost nine of their 10 home Premier League games this campaign, the exception being a 5-0 rout of Sheffield United. They are the first team in English top-flight history to lose nine of their first 10 home matches at the start of a season, while only one team has ever lost 10 of their first 11 in Football League history – Newport County doing so as a fourth-tier side in 1970-71. Lyle Foster’s omission from South Africa’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations could prove a major boost to Burnley in the coming weeks, with the striker boasting four goals and three assists in just 894 minutes of Premier League action this campaign. However, Foster sustained a knock in last week’s defeat at Tottenham and must be assessed before Friday’s game. Burnley are also hoping to have defenders Jordan Beyer and Hjalmar Ekdal available, though Charlie Taylor is doubtful with a shoulder injury and Luca Koleosho is a long-term absentee. Though Burnley were tipped by many to impress on their top-flight return in pre-season, Luton have been the most competitive of the promoted clubs thus far, and they know a victory at Turf Moor would lift them out of the bottom three as well as dragging Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace into the relegation conversation. Rob Edwards’ Hatters enjoyed a broadly positive festive period, clinching back-to-back wins over Newcastle United (1-0) and Sheffield United (3-2) before just coming up short in a 3-2 defeat to Chelsea, almost fighting back from 3-0 down to earn a point at Kenilworth Road. They were then held to a goalless draw by third-tier Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup, with a replay to be held next week. Ross Barkley and Elijah Adebayo were on target as Luton were just held off by Chelsea on their last league outing, and both have emerged as key players for the Hatters in recent weeks. Adebayo is their leading Premier League scorer with five goals in the competition, though only one of those efforts – against Forest in October – has come on the road. The only Luton player with more than one away league goal this campaign is Carlton Morris (two), who has fallen down the pecking order after going 13 league games without netting, home or away. With Adebayo always offering an aerial threat, Luton might fancy their chances of adding to Burnley’s set-piece woes on Friday. Only Forest (nine) have conceded more goals from dead-ball situations (excluding penalties) than Burnley’s eight in the Premier League this season, with the Clarets giving up a competition-high 8.41 expected goals (xG) from such scenarios. The dead-ball prowess of Alfie Doughty could allow Luton to take advantage of those frailties, with only West Ham’s James Ward-Prowse creating more chances (25) or recording more assists (five) from set-pieces than Doughty (22 chances created, four assists) in the Premier League this term. Issa Kaboré will be absent after being named in Burkina Faso’s AFCON squad, but Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu is available after being overlooked by DR Congo. Marvelous Nakamba and Tom Lockyer are Luton’s long-term absentees, with Reece Burke closing in on a return after suffering a thigh injury. This will be Burnley’s first home game against Luton in the top flight since January 1975, when a Billy Ingham goal handed them a 1-0 win. The Clarets are unbeaten in their last seven league games against Luton overall, winning four and drawing three. After earning their first Premier League win of the season at Kenilworth Road in October, they could do the double over the Hatters for the first time since 1994-95 in the second tier. Jacob Bruun Larsen scored a stunning winner five minutes from time in the reverse fixture, with that goal coming just 65 seconds after Adebayo cancelled out Foster’s opener to make it 1-1. However, Luton have a good record at Turf Moor, going unbeaten through their last seven away league games against Burnley (three wins, four draws) since suffering a 2-1 defeat in March 1995 under David Pleat. Following their dramatic Boxing Day victory over Sheffield United, Luton are targeting back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since December 1987, when they achieved the feat under Ray Harford. Burnley, meanwhile, have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions since thrashing the Blades in early December, drawing one and losing five during that time. Though the Clarets have failed to score in their last two at Turf Moor, neutrals may have reason to expect some prime-time entertainment on Friday. Thirteen goals have been scored across the three previous Premier League matches between promoted clubs this season, at an average of 4.3 per game. That is the highest figure ever recorded in matches between promoted sides in a single campaign in the competition. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world.

Of 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of kick-off, Burnley won 38.5% to Luton’s 32.4%, with 29.1% finishing level. The outcome of this contest could have a huge impact on both teams’ survival chances, with Luton currently given more hope of escaping the drop than Burnley. In the supercomputer’s season predictions, Luton are relegated in 65.3% of scenarios, giving them a 34.7% chance of survival. Burnley, meanwhile, return to the Championship in 91.6% of our simulations, finishing 19th 46.5% of the time. \\xa0 Enjoy this?

Morocco became the first African team to make it past the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals just over a year ago, before eventually losing to France at the semi-final stage of Qatar 2022. They’ll be looking to follow up that success with their first AFCON title since 1976.

We are now just a few days away from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations getting started, with hosts Ivory Coast facing Guinea-Bissau in Saturday’s curtain raiser. Although only two of the top 20-ranked teams in the world according to FIFA are involved, AFCON rarely fails to capture the imagination. The talent on show will be plentiful, both in terms of superstars and up-and-coming prospects. Mohamed Salah, Mohammed Kudus, Sadio Mané, Riyad Mahrez, Victor Osimhen and Ismael Bennacer are among the big names for whom there’ll be great expectations, but as with any major international tournament, there will be less familiar faces hoping to leave a lasting impression. Ahead of Saturday’s big kick-off, we’ve identified eight players as ‘ones to watch’ as they aim to announce themselves on the international stage. Red Bull Salzburg have earned a reputation as a breeding ground for talented young players over the past few years, especially for forwards. Karim Konaté looks to be next off the so-called production line, and this tournament gives him the opportunity to make a real statement. At 17, Konaté was actually in Ivory Coast’s squad for the last Africa Cup of Nations by virtue of his spectacular breakthrough at ASEC Mimosas – he didn’t feature, but his inclusion was an early indication of the regard he was held in. And while he may not begin this tournament as a starter for the AFCON hosts, who are – as ever – blessed with serious talent in forward positions, Konaté can reasonably expect to play a much bigger part than he did in Cameroon two years ago. Quick, intelligent and possessing the abilities of a potentially elite finisher, Konaté could be a real wildcard for Ivory Coast; he might play off the left for the most part, but he already has a strong track record of having a decisive impact in the box at whatever level he’s played. No one has scored more than him in the Austrian Bundesliga this season (8), and his 9.1 non-penalty expected goals (xG) is 2.6 more than anyone else. Granted, playing for the best team in the league is undoubtedly an advantage here, but it’s still evidence of how he’s getting shots away in dangerous areas, which is obviously a big plus for a forward. Only six players have registered more shots than Konaté (38) this season in Austria’s top flight but none of those have a conversion rate that comes close to his 21.1%, with all but four of his attempts coming inside the box. With just one AFCON title since their maiden success in 1992, Ivory Coast have been one of the biggest underachievers in this tournament; nevertheless, they’ll once again be expected to go deep into the tournament, hopefully providing Konaté with ample opportunities to shine. Admittedly, choosing one of the two top scorers in the Bundesliga this season for a ‘ones to watch’ piece might not be a particularly hot take, but for the casual/infrequent viewer of German football tuning in to watch the AFCON, Guirassy probably won’t be that familiar beyond seeing his name in transfer gossip columns. Those columns have linked Guirassy with a host of huge clubs, including Manchester United and Newcastle in the Premier League, and with a release clause set at roughly €17.5 million (£15m), he’s very much in the shop window. Having struggled to live up to his potential as a young player and becoming something of a joke figure at Köln, Guirassy, 27, is now in the form of his life at Stuttgart. His goals were instrumental in helping the team avoid relegation from the Bundesliga last term; this season they’ve helped put Stuttgart on course for a return to the Champions League, having last competed among Europe’s elite in 2009-10. A very well-rounded striker, Guirassy’s goalscoring exploits in 2023-24 have been remarkable. His haul of 14 from the first eight matchdays of this season was a Bundesliga record, and he ultimately reached the winter break with 17. Now, that makes it sound like he hit a bit of brick wall in the context of his previous form, but it’s worth noting he missed a couple of games due to injury and was only fit enough to come on as a second-half substitute in another two. Nevertheless, Guirassy’s output for the season retains its gleam. No player with more than seven goals across the top five European leagues this term has a better conversion rate (35.4%) than him, and he’s also put away 60% of his big chances (opportunities a player would be expected to finish), a record only five players presented with at least 10 such chances can better. Guirassy’s 4.8 overperformance in relation to his non-penalty (np) xG of 9.2 is fourth highest across the top five leagues and highlights just how clinical he’s been, scoring some wonderful goals in the process. It may not be completely sustainable form, but 9.2 np xG is still a brilliant return that suggests he’s consistently getting himself into threatening positions. It also converts to 0.78 on a per-90-minute basis, putting him fifth in the top five leagues (minimum 600 minutes played). Guinea find themselves in a difficult group alongside Senegal, Cameroon and The Gambia, so a dependable finisher could be their trump card, assuming the knee injury he sustained in a pre-tournament friendly doesn’t turn out to be serious. In Edmond Tapsoba and now Adamo Nagalo, Burkina Faso potentially have a highly talented centre-back partnership they can build around for the next decade – not that they’ve been partnered together extensively yet. Nagalo, 21, hasn’t always been a centre-back, though. Much of his formative years were spent in midfield and that perhaps goes some way to explaining his technical and passing abilities. Despite not turning 22 until September, Nagalo already boasts considerable experience at club level with Nordsjælland, whom he joined in 2020 from the highly-regarded Right to Dream academy, which is part of the same ownership group as the Danish Superliga club and behind the development of players like Kudus, Kamaldeen Sulemana, Ernest Nuamah and Simon Adingra. Reportedly of interest to Brighton in the past, Nagalo is an exceptionally confident distributor who plays a vital role in tempo-setting from the back for his club. Experts question some of his decisions in terms of positioning, but with respect to the abilities that a modern ball-playing centre-back requires, Nagalo looks likely to be in one of Europe’s top leagues in the not-too-distant future. He’s the only defender in the Danish top tier (minimum 620 minutes played) to average over 100 touches per 90 minutes played (110.4), and he also attempts the most passes per game (100.1) as he helps Nordsjælland establish control. Only FC Copenhagen full-back Kevin Diks (664) has played more passes in the opposition’s half among defenders in the division than Nagalo (555), who’s also proven himself to be an adept progressor of the ball through carries (defined as a movement of five metres or more with the ball). Nagalo has progressed the ball 1,807m up field via 180 progressive carries, coming second to Diks alone in both metrics, not only highlighting his positive mentality but also sound technical skills. Burkina Faso will do well to match their run to the semi-finals from two years ago, but in Tapsoba and now Nagalo, they possess real play-making talent at the back that could provide a solid foundation to another expectation-defying campaign. Aged 18 at the time, Bilal El Khannouss had less than a year’s experience in senior football when he was handed his Morocco debut during the third-place play-off at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Although it was his misplaced pass that led to Mislav Orsić’s clincher as Croatia won 2-1, the teenager otherwise looked the part with his silky, delicate touches and confidence carrying the ball. Nearly 13 months on, El Khannouss will likely be expecting to play a slightly more important role for Walid Regragui’s men having tallied a few more starts for the Atlas Lions during 2023. He’s also continued to develop well at Genk, enjoying a positive 2023-24 campaign even if his club have been disappointing collectively. El Khannouss is a creative and technically gifted central midfielder who is capable of playing deeper or as a number 10. Just as comfortable running with the ball as he is picking out defence-splitting passes, the 19-year-old already looks like a gem and is having a big impact on the Belgian Pro League this season. Only four players have created more chances in open play than his 34 and he also ranks as high as joint-third for secondary chances created (23) – essentially the pass to a player who creates an opportunity – highlighting El Khannouss’ ability to be influential both in build-up and the final third. His play-making and creativitiy are helped by excellent vision and the technique to complete the passes he visualises. The graphic above suggests El Khannouss’ key passes are often on the longer side and the data backs up this theory. Among players with at least 15 open-play chances created in the Pro League this season, he ranks joint-sixth for longest average length of key pass (24.5m), and three of those above him are either wide midfielders or full-backs, meaning their outputs are likely distorted by crosses. Beyond specifically impacting things in attack, El Khannouss also brings purpose to Genk in possession, with his 107 progressive passes bettered by only five players. He has also made the joint-third most successful switches (17), a key function considering the importance of Genk’s wide forwards Alieu Fadera and Joseph Paintsil, both of whom will also be in AFCON action with The Gambia and Ghana respectively. Morocco do have plenty of talent in midfield, but if El Khannouss gets an opportunity to shine, don’t expect him to pass it up.  While Fadera’s promising first season at Genk undoubtedly marks him out as a player worth keeping your eye on, Gambia teammate Yankuba Minteh promises to receive plenty of attention because he’s owned by Newcastle United. Signed from Odense Boldklub last year and loaned out to Feyenoord for the season, there have been mutterings that Newcastle could attempt to cut his time in the Eredivisie short due to their injury crisis, and for many Magpies fans, the AFCON will offer a first glimpse of the 19-year-old right winger in competitive action. Whether there is any realistic chance of his loan being cut short, there’s no question Minteh remains rather raw. His decision-making in the final third needs work and he has a tendency to overcomplicate things. But he’s a very exciting talent nonetheless, with his brave and direct running out wide making him a real handful for defenders, regardless of his end product. Among players to play at least 500 minutes in the Eredivisie this term, Minteh’s average of 10 dribble attempts per 90 is second only to Osame Sahraoui (11), and he’s carrying the ball 315m per game, nearly 20m further than anyone else. Of those 315m, 186.1m are deemed to be him progressing the ball up field, putting him behind only centre-back Dávid Hancko (204.2m), with Minteh’s 15.1 progressive carries every 90 minutes the third most in the division. He also works hard off the ball; Minteh’s the only player in the Eredivisie (minimum 500 minutes played) in 2023-24 to average more than 1.9 possession regains in the final third (2.2) and he ranks sixth for tackles per 90 (3.5) as well, which are good signs for a player hoping to break into an Eddie Howe side. The Gambia aren’t short on explosive attacking talent, but given they are alongside Senegal, Cameroon and Guinea in a very difficult Group C, there’s an opportunity for their players to make a name for themselves here, and Minteh certainly looks capable of bringing a bit of chaos. As far as in-demand centre-backs go, Ousmane Diomande is one of the hottest properties in Europe at the moment, with many of the continent’s biggest clubs apparently keen on the Sporting CP defender. A fine physical specimen, quick and agile for his build, and a graceful ball-playing defender, Diomande has almost everything the modern centre-back needs and has only just turned 20. He’s approaching the one-year anniversary of his move to Sporting, who were so impressed with his performances for Mafra in the Portuguese second tier that they struck a deal with his parent club Midtjylland to sign him in a transfer that could be worth over €12m despite him never even playing for the Danish side. All but two of Diomande’s 28 Primeira Liga appearances since then have been as a starter, with head coach Rúben Amorim quickly warming to the young talent. Friday’s 5-1 demolition of Estoril was the first league game he’s missed this season, with Sporting sitting top of the table on 40 points from 16 matches. Diomande has mostly featured on the right side of a back three for Sporting and he plays an important role in getting the team on the front foot with his positive mentality. While ball progression via passing isn’t exactly a standout strength of his, only three centre-backs in the Primeira Liga can better his 158 progressive carries this term. And although the point about progressive passing stands, his 52 involvements in build-up sequences ending in a shot is 11 more than any other central defender in the division and highlights his reliability on the ball at the back. He’s also recorded the most secondary chances created among centre-backs (11). Much like at club level, Diomande will be playing in an Ivory Coast side that expects to be on the front foot, so that should suit him. But his recovery pace will also be a real bonus to coach Jean-Louis Gasset, especially against the better sides. Diomande’s game still requires a bit of polishing, but he’ll be in one of the top leagues sooner rather than later, and this tournament could take his breakthrough to the next level. A teammate of Diomande’s at Sporting CP, Geny Catamo is a bundle of energy on the right flank and undoubtedly Mozambique’s most talented attacking player. Comfortable either as a wing-back – where he’s mostly played at club level – or further forward as an inverted winger, Geny has only established himself in Sporting’s senior side this season after patiently waiting for a crack in the first team since joining four years ago. However, his breakthrough was recently rewarded with a new long-term contract containing a release clause set at €60m, evidence of the regard Sporting hold him in. Geny may not be the tallest but he’s blessed with searing pace and loves to run at defenders, with his 4.9 dribble attempts per 90 minutes the ninth-most in the Primeira Liga (minimum 500 minutes played) this season. This is combined with a direct and positive mindset as Geny ranks sixth for carries (19.2) and progressive carries (11.3) every 90 minutes. He isn’t yet a reliable creative source, however his 1.3 secondary chances created per 90 puts him 10th in the division and suggests he is using the ball well in the final third – his three secondary assists is also only bettered by four players (none have more than four). Of course, Mozambique are one of the least fancied teams at the AFCON, with their 0.6% chance of winning the trophy considered the third-lowest of all by the Opta supercomputer. But at the same time, there also won’t be any pressure. Geny can be electrifying; Mozambique will hope he can spark at least an unlikely run to the knockouts, though they’ll have to cope without him on Matchday 1 due to suspension. Like Guirassy, Omar Marmoush is another talented attacker heading to the AFCON during a fine campaign in the Bundesliga. Marmoush also isn’t exactly an unknown quantity given his star status at Eintracht Frankfurt this season, but to viewers unfamiliar with the German top flight, he could be a breath of fresh air. The 24-year-old isn’t a guaranteed starter for the Pharaohs so will have to make the most of any opportunities he gets to impress, but his form at Frankfurt suggests he’s more than capable of doing some damage. Although his former Wolfsburg coach Oliver Glasner departed Eintracht between Marmoush signing and officially joining on a very shrewd free transfer, he’s taken his game to a new level playing almost exclusively as a centre-forward under Dino Toppmöller – but a simple fox in the box he certainly is not. Quick, strong and technically excellent, Marmoush’s talents make him a threat across the frontline and in many different scenarios. He scored poacher-like goals against Mainz, Union Berlin and Borussia Dortmund, whereas in a 3-1 win at Hoffenheim he transformed a hopeful long ball into a goal as he turned John Brooks inside-out before a clever outside-of-the-boot finish into the bottom-right corner. The latter goal was a prime example of his carrying proficiency, which arguably marks him out as somewhat unusual among central strikers – even if he does drift out wide a bit. He’s tallied 15 more carries (151) and carried the ball 250m further (1,786m) than any other striker in the Bundesliga this term, while his combined total of 18 shots and chances created at the end of a carry is bettered only by Victor Boniface (23) among the same group of players. In all competitions in 2023-24, Marmoush has 15 goal involvements (12 goals, three assists), which is already the same total as he managed for the previous two seasons combined. It would also be remiss of us not to mention his inspirational display in the 5-1 hammering of Bayern Munich last month, when he scored once and got two assists. He heads to Ivory Coast in the form of his life. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

The 34th edition of the CAF Africa Cup of Nations kicks off on Saturday, with hosts Ivory Coast taking on Guinea-Bissau at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan in Group A. It’ll be their 100th AFCON game, so they’ll be looking to celebrate reaching the century with a strong performance in front of their own fans. On the only previous occasion that Ivory Coast hosted AFCON, they exited in the group stage (1984), so a win in this match would ease worries about them repeating that disastrous tournament finish. History shows they are strong starters, with Ivory Coast unbeaten in their last 12 opening games at an AFCON tournament (W7 D5). Their recent form suggests that they aren’t shy of goalscorers in their side, either. They have scored 16 goals in their last three matches, with a 9-0 win over Seychelles and 2-0 win over Gambia in World Cup qualification followed up by a pre-AFCON friendly win over Sierra Leone (5-1).  Ivory Coast automatically qualified for AFCON 2023 as hosts, but they had to take part in qualifying anyway, finishing runners-up in Group H ahead of Comoros and Lesotho. They finished the group with 13 points from their six games, with their draw against Lesotho being the only point Lesotho earned in qualifying, and their single loss coming against group winners Zambia. Ivory Coast have previously participated at AFCON 24 times, a number only bettered by Egypt (25). They have been crowned champions twice, in 1992 and 2015. Both finals were against Ghana and both finished 0-0 after extra-time, then going to penalties. The 1992 final was the first major international final penalty shootout in which every player for both teams took a spot kick. Ivory Coast’s last AFCON appearance was again decided by a shootout after a goalless draw, but one which they were on the wrong end of, losing 5-4 to Egypt in the round of 16. Guinea-Bissau have failed to score in their last seven matches at the AFCON, a record for any team in the history of the competition. In total, it’s been over 11 hours since they last found the net (707 minutes). Their final warm-up game for this tournament did see them score twice, but their defence was breached six times in a 6-2 friendly loss to Mali on 6 January. Guinea-Bissau qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in Group A, ahead of Sierra Leone and São Tomé and Príncipe. They got 13 points from their six matches, and were the only team in the group to take points off rampant group winners Nigeria. In fact, it was a Nigerian 95th-minute winner against Sierra Leone which secured Guinea-Bissau’s qualification to this tournament on 18 June 2023. Before 2023, Guinea-Bissau have qualified for AFCON three times, those being the last three tournaments (2017, 2019 and 2021). They have thus far failed to progress from the group stages, but finished all three tournaments with the same record – fourth in the group with one draw and two losses. This will be the first encounter between Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau at the Africa Cup of Nations. Tournament hosts Ivory Coast are backed to start their 2023 AFCON campaign with a victory by the Opta supercomputer. They won 59.0% of pre-match simulations, compared to 20.4% won by Guinea-Bissau, while 20.6% of games ended in a draw. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Ivory Coast on a 12.1% chance of winning the competition behind favourites Senegal and ahead of Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria and Cameroon. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Ivory Coast: Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté Coach: Jean-Louis Gasset Guinea-Bissau: Ouparine Djoco, Jonas Mendes, Fernando Embadje, Sori Mané, Marcelo Djaló, Fali Candé, Jefferson Encada, Edgar Ié, Opa Sanganté, Nanu, Prosper Mendy, Nito Gomes, Dálcio, Zidane Banjaqui, Janio Bikel, Moreto Cassamá, Mauro Rodrigues, Alfa Semedo, Famana Quizera, Carlos Mané, Mama Baldé, Marciano Sanca, Zé Turbo, Carlos Gomes, Zinho Gano, Franculino Djú Coach: Baciro Candé Enjoy this?

We assess why they have signed him. You didn’t need hindsight to know Spurs were taking a huge risk by ending the summer 2023 transfer window with only two recognised centre-backs that their manager trusts in the squad. Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero had already shown that they were a perfect fit together, and they had shown that their new partnership had the potential to be a fruitful one for Tottenham for years to come. And up until November, it looked like the risk might just pay off. But then Spurs were made to pay. Romero did a Romero and got himself sent off for a wild lunge against Chelsea – leading to a three-game ban – and Van de Ven’s hamstring pinged 12 minutes later. Since returning from suspension, Romero has suffered a hamstring injury of his own (while also getting away with a couple of fouls that might have drawn red cards). With Postecoglou unwilling to play the soon-to-depart Eric Dier or loaned-out-youngster Ashley Phillips, it has meant full-backs Ben Davies and Emerson Royal deputising at the heart of defence. After an unbeaten start to the season, a run of four defeats and a draw saw Spurs’ ever-so-brief title challenge fall apart. Even if it weren’t for those injuries and suspensions, signing another centre-back in January would surely still have been the “priority” that Postecoglou has called it. And so, Spurs have completed a deal for Genoa’s Romanian centre-back Radu Dragusin. The 21-year-old becomes the latest import from Serie A – a market Spurs have concentrated on more than any other Premier League side in recent years and have had some real success with. Romero, Rodrigo Bentancur, Dejan Kulusevski, Destiny Udogie and Guglielmo Vicario have all improved Tottenham’s current first-choice XI having moved directly from Italy. There may be some concern that Dragusin could struggle to adapt to Postecoglou’s style of football. After all, he has been playing for recently promoted Genoa, who have adapted to life in the top flight by allowing their opponents the ball. They rank 18th of 20 teams in Serie A this season for possession, averaging just 42.1%, and allow the opposition to dominate territory, too. As the below graphic shows, Genoa only have significantly more of the ball than their opponents close to or inside their own penalty area. They rank among the least proactive teams when out of possession, allowing their opponents an average of 14.8 passes per defensive action (PPDA) – the fifth lowest rate in the Italian top tier. To put it lightly, they aren’t playing much like Postecoglou’s possession-heavy Tottenham, who average 9.7 PPDA – the second-lowest figure in the Premier League this season. There are a good few reasons not to fear too much, though. Firstly, Postecoglou looks for specific attributes in his players and has plenty of experience in training his squad members to be the players he wants them to be. Take Udogie and Pedro Porro, for example, who a few months ago had basically only ever played at wing-back, and now look like two of the Premier League’s most accomplished inverted full-backs. Or Vicario, who had played behind a much deeper defence at Empoli, but looks perfectly at home playing out from the back and sweeping up behind Postecoglou’s high line. Those three players have been up there with the Premier League’s biggest success stories of 2023-24 so far. But the main reason to be optimistic that Dragusin could make the adjustment in playing style is that he has done so a few times already in his career. He is adaptable, driven, open-minded and, of course, still very, very young. “He is totally professional,” Alexander Blessin, the former Genoa manager who signed Dragusin in 2022, tells Opta Analyst. “He works hard on the pitch and in the gym after training. But he was also very inquisitive. We worked with him every week with individual video analysis, and he took everything on. We saw him improve a lot.” Dragusin moved to Italy back in 2018, when Juventus signed him as a 16-year-old, and he was handed his debut under the possession-focused Andrea Pirlo. Although he only made a few short appearances under him, Pirlo obviously saw in the teenager an ability to play his passing game. When Pirlo was replaced by Massimiliano Allegri in 2021 – and Juventus’ average possession dropped below 55% for the first time in any season in more than a decade – Dragusin was loaned out to Sampdoria, where he made only 13 appearances, before moving to Salernitana for the second half of 2021-22.  A look at our team styles comparison graph for that season shows the types of team he was playing for. Salernitana were the most direct team in the league, while they averaged the second-fewest passes per sequence, while Sampdoria’s sequences had more passes and progressed up the field more slowly.   Then Genoa and Blessin came calling after being relegated to Serie B. That move and his debut soon after meant Dragusin had played senior league football for four different teams in less than two years. With Genoa aiming to be a possession-dominant force in Serie B, it meant another drastic change in style for Dragusin. Blessin had seen enough in a player who was still only 20 to be convinced he should do everything he could to sign him, even though he had been playing for a more defensive side than he wanted Genoa to be. “He was my dream player for Genoa that season,” Blessin says. “Still young, but physically strong, a model athlete and a very good defender. “We still had to work on some things with him. We did a lot with him on his tactical behaviour and positioning against the ball. “Also, he is right-footed but played on the left side of defence and sometimes his build-up play wasn’t so strong. But he worked very hard every day and got better and better.” The results from that 2022-23 campaign speak for themselves. Genoa won automatic promotion straight back up to Serie A, with Dragusin playing more regular-season minutes (3,375) than any other outfielder in the league. He played a key role in Genoa building through the lines, ranking third in Serie B for successful passes (1,641) and successful passes in his own half (1,213). He also ranked 11th in the league for the number of different open-play passing sequences in which he played a part (1,425). He was clearly heavily involved in the in-possession side of the game for a team that wanted to keep and dominate the ball. They were near the slower and more intricate end of our team style comparison scale in Serie B, having been at the opposite end in Serie A just a season before. Dragusin was key to that transition going smoothly. He did plenty of important work bringing the ball out of defence. Only two other centre-backs made more carries – defined as moving with the ball a distance of at least five metres – than him (435) in Serie B in 2022-23, with almost half of those carries (208) defined as ‘progressive’, which means moving at least five metres up the pitch towards the opposition’s goal. Dragusin ranked fifth, meanwhile, for carries that ended with a pass (370), showing that he kept his composure and looked to find a teammate after breaking a line or drawing in pressure by carrying the ball forward. His aforementioned passing numbers suggest he was often successful with his passes, too. Having gone back up to the top flight this summer and made his move to Genoa permanent – finally taking the brave decision to leave Juventus behind for good – Dragusin has seen less of the ball and has had to do far more defending. Again, he has proved able to adapt. Only Cagliari’s Alberto Dossena (97) has made more clearances in Serie A this season than Dragusin (87). He also ranks third both for headed clearances (45) and aerial duels won (59), with the latter tally the most of all defenders. When the ball is on the floor, he prefers not to make an attempt to win the ball with a tackle, instead hoping for a physical battle – he has actually had more shots this season (17) than he has attempted tackles (16). He is very strong and extremely quick – something that will help him in Tottenham’s high line and cover across the pitch in the space vacated by the attacking inverted full-backs – so he is more than happy for his opponent to try and take him on. His tendency not to attempt tackles and the fact he has good recovery pace mean he doesn’t get caught out very often (sounds a bit like Van de Ven, right?). He has only been dribbled past once all season and has also only been booked once. By way of comparison, one of Tottenham’s current stand-in centre-backs, Emerson Royal, is being dribbled past on average 1.7 times every 90 minutes this season and has three yellow cards to his name in 14 hours less playing time than Dragusin (777 minutes compared to 1,710). It would be difficult for any new signing to be more rash than the woefully ill-disciplined Romero but Spurs fans will still be pleased nonetheless to know how infrequently Dragusin gets booked. He has mostly played in a back three over the past 18 months for Genoa, but Spurs often build with a three-man defence as both full-backs invert simultaneously, so he could well learn their in-possession game without too much trouble. He is also extremely versatile; despite playing most of his football at left centre-back, he can play across the back line. In Genoa’s last six games, for example, he has played on the left side of the back three twice, in the middle of the three on three occasions, and once on the right side of the three. The fact that he alone can act as a back-up to both Van de Ven and Romero as a left-sided or right-sided centre-back is a huge bonus. He also has the potential to one day usurp one of them. Blessin, having worked closely with the youngster, is in no doubt as to Dragusin’s prospects in the Premier League. “He is a model professional,” he says. “He has the perfect character to make his next step a success.” All the ingredients are there to suggest this is another Serie A import that Spurs fans should be excited about.

Wu Lei is the top scorer in the current Chinese squad and the second-highest scorer in their history, with 32 international goals. He comes into this tournament as one of their most experienced and dangerous attacking players, so he will carry much of the burden going forwards. In the last edition of the Asian Cup in 2019, he scored twice and was the joint-highest scorer in the Chinese team alongside Yu Dabao. He was their main attacking threat, taking at least 10 more touches in the opponent’s penalty area (29) than any other teammate, while also recording 1.62 expected goals, second only to Yu Dabao (1.72). He had five shots in the games against Thailand and the Philippines, the joint most by a Chinese player in a single Asian Cup match on record (since 2007). In the recently-concluded 2023 Chinese Super League season, Wu Lei scored 18 goals, helping Shanghai Port to the title, with only Leonardo scoring more (19). In fact, since leaving Spanish side Espanyol in August 2022 and returning to Shanghai Port, he has scored 29 goals in the league, the joint-highest tally among Chinese Super League players. Wu Lei is known for his speed and is a huge weapon on the break. Since moving back to Shanghai, he has had 13 shots from counter-attacks, ranking second in the league during that period alongside Oscar Maritu (14). Wu Lei, however, is the best finisher from such situations, having scored at least three more goals (five) on the counter than any other player. Wei Wei Australia head into the 2023 AFC Asian Cup buoyant from a reasonably successful World Cup campaign that saw them scuppered at the last-16 stage by eventual champions Argentina. With a familiar squad named for their return to Qatar, the Socceroos will be optimistic of an even deeper drive into the knockout stages. The inclusion of Melbourne Victory’s Bruno Fornaroli was inevitable given the Uruguay-born striker was in sensational form in the A-League Men, displaying the kind of natural goal-scoring acumen reminiscent of the days of Tim Cahill, Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and co. in the green and gold. After only seven games of the 2023-24 A-League Men season, Fornaroli was brushing with history, becoming the second-fastest player to 10 goals in a season (seven matches) behind only Jamie Maclaren’s six-game effort in 2019-20. In the process, he became just the third player to log 100 goals in the competition after Maclaren and Besart Berisha. Fornaroli has scored four goals in a game twice in his last nine appearances in the competition, with his haul against Western Sydney Wanderers in December coming from just four shots. That made him one of only two players to have scored four or more goals in multiple games in the competition alongside Shane Smeltz (2). Two caps in March 2022 for the Socceroos means Fornaroli won’t come into this as a complete newcomer, but he’ll be hoping to get more than the 45 and 22 minutes he was allowed on the pitch in those fixtures as Australia look to claim their second AFC Asian Cup title. Shane Miles and Lukas Zaher Ali Mabkhout, the all-time leading scorer for the UAE national team and the UAE Pro League, is a cool and calm character. It’s become a common sight to see him produce little more than a smile as his celebration after scoring; after all, he’s scored so many over the years that anything more exaggerated might become tiresome.  Even if we ignore his post-scoring behaviour, Mabkhout is generally not completely satisfied with just getting goals. He also plays a pivotal role in his club side, Al Jazira, with his movements inside and outside the penalty area, plus the creation of chances for teammates. Over the last three UAE Pro League seasons, he’s been involved in the third-most attacking sequences, and more than any other striker in this period. His status in the UAE Pro League is significant given he’s scored more goals than anyone else in it, but Mabkhout has other records in sight as well. He’s aiming to become the most prolific Arab player in all top-tier leagues around globe, with his 216 goals behind only Omar Al Somah (230) – currently playing for Al-Arabi in Qatar – and Abderrazak Hamdallah (229) of Saudi Arabia’s Al-Ittihad. But as alluded to before, Mabkhout’s record at international level is no less impressive, and he has a record in sight at this tournament as well. No player scored more goals than Mabkhout across the last two editions of the Asian Cup (nine goals), tied with Qatar’s Almoez Ali, who scored all nine of his in the last edition to set a single-tournament record. Both players are now just five away from Iran great Ali Daei’s all-time benchmark of 14. His Qatari rival may offer some stiff competition, but it’s certainly not an achievement that’s out of Mabkhout’s reach. He might crack a little more than a smile if this proves to be a fruitful campaign. Amro Hannoun After wins over former world champions Germany and Spain in the 2022 World Cup, Japan have emerged as a footballing force to be reckoned with. The Samurai Blue arrive at this AFC Asian Cup in red-hot form, especially in front of goal, having scored four or more in eight of their 11 games since Qatar 2022. Japan’s squad is brimming with talent, with a plethora of players now plying their trade in Europe as key cogs for their respective sides, including captain Wataru Endo at Liverpool.  One other such player is Real Sociedad’s Takefusa Kubo. The 22-year-old is fulfilling the promise shown at an early age that made Barcelona take notice of him in 2011, and then Real Madrid in 2019. After being named as La Real’s Player of the Season in 2022-23 for his 13 goal contributions (9 goals and 4 assists) in La Liga, Kubo has followed it up with another nine goal involvements (6 goals and 3 assists) already this term. His six goals in 2023-24 have come from a non-penalty expected goals (npxG) value of just 2.6, with only Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham (+5.8) boasting a better npxG differential than Kubo (+3.4) in Spain’s top flight this season. The former Real Madrid talent is a menace while driving with the ball at his feet. The left-footed tricky winger is blessed with quick feet and vision to break lines with his passing. With a tendency to cut inside from the right, Kubo is adept at turning these opportunities into shots, further adding to his threat. Only Rodrygo (34) and Iñaki Williams (31) have recorded more shot-ending carries in La Liga than the Japan international (28) this season. After finishing as runners-up in the 2019 edition of the AFC Asian Cup, Japan will be eager to bring home a record-extending fifth title. If they do, there’s every chance Kubo will have been the difference. Yash Thakur Son Heung-min will be the first name that springs to mind when many people think of Asia’s best football exports. He became the first Asian player ever to finish a season as the top scorer in one of Europe’s top five leagues in the 2021-22 Premier League campaign with 23 goals, the same as Mohamed Salah. He’s arguably the continent’s greatest player ever, but there’s one thing missing: a trophy. After his former Tottenham partner-in-crime Harry Kane moved to Bayern Munich in search of finally winning some silverware, the AFC Asian Cup is the best chance for Son to do so. He has tried three times before, representing South Korea at the tournament in 2011, 2015 and 2019, but he’s yet to lift the trophy. The closest he got was in 2015 when his current Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou denied Son at the last hurdle, with Australia beating the Taeguk Warriors 2-1 after extra time in the final in Sydney. The 2019 edition was Son’s worst. He failed to score a single goal, attempting just three shots while playing just shy of 300 minutes, but the good news is he’s on fire again this season. Son has scored 12 goals and recorded five assists in 20 Premier League appearances for Postecoglou’s new-look Spurs, already exceeding last season’s goal involvements tally (10 goals and six assists) from 16 fewer matches. He’s also the biggest xG overperformer in the competition (+4.9 – 12 goals from 7.1 xG), highlighting just how deadly he’s been in front of goal. He’s well known as a sharpshooter, but Son – now a captain at club and international level – can also be a reliable source of creativity. He’s one of the four forwards involved in 100+ shot-ending open-play sequences in the Premier League this season (115), while Salah is the only forward who has created more chances in open play. Considering his talents as a double-threat in attack plus the leadership and experience he brings, Son is the player who can lead this team down the path of glory to the triumph his legacy deserves. Yonghun Lee Feras Al Brikan may only be 23 years old, but with 38 caps for Saudi Arabia, his experience is already quite extensive and he’ll take on a key role in Qatar after becoming one of the most-trusted players of Hervé Renard during his time in charge. Nicknamed ‘the melody player’ for his trademark celebration in which he mimics strumming a stringed instrument, Al Brikan will hope his teammates are playing to the same rhythm over the next month, with Saudi Arabia aiming to win a record-equalling fourth title and first since 1996. Although Al Brikan was first capped in 2019, it wasn’t really until late 2021/early 2022 that he cemented his place as Saudi Arabia’s main striker, with three goals in a run of five World Cup qualifiers – his strikes all came in victories as they defeated Japan, China and Oman. He started his club career with Al Nassr but, after only being used sparingly due to the presence of Abderrazak Hamdallah as first-choice in attack, he made the decision to leave for Al-Fateh in 2021. He’s not looked back since, going from strength to strength and boasting a scoring record of better than one in two (32 goals in 62 matches). This form persuaded Saudi Pro League title hopefuls Al-Ahli to make a move for him in September, and it’s proven a shrewd move with Roberto Firmino embarking on a 16-match barren run in front of goal since netting a hat-trick on his debut in August. Al Brikan’s last game for Al-Fateh actually came in a 5-1 mauling of Al-Ahli, impressing the latter’s coach Matthias Jaissle so much in his goal-scoring performance that the German supposedly pushed for his signing immediately. It’s been a good match so far as well, with Al Brikan scoring seven in 12 SPL games this season, making him the division’s top-scoring Saudi player since his debut in April 2018 (43). What distinguishes Al Brikan the most is the accuracy of his shots and how clinical he’s been over the past few years. Since joining Al-Fateh, Al Brikan has scored 39 goals in the Saudi Pro League; among players who’ve netted at least 30 goals in that period, he has comfortably the best conversion rate (33.1%). In a Group C that also contains Iraq, Thailand and Tajikistan, Al Brikan can expect opportunities to display such abilities, which would be a welcome sight for Saudi fans who have only seen him net once for the senior side since early 2022.

The misinterpreted quotes were quickly taken out of context to mock the ex-midfielder and they’ve followed him throughout his managerial career.\\xa0\\xa0 This placed great pressure upon Motta ahead of his first senior management role at Genoa in 2019, and the former Italy international was sacked just nine league games into his reign – something that was certainly not an anomaly at the Marassi under the tumultuous ownership of Enrico Preziosi. Motta then took charge of relegation-touted Spezia for the 2021-22 season, leading the side to safety despite a transfer ban. His team recorded 10 victories (including scalps at both Milan and Napoli), their outright most in a single Serie A campaign.\\xa0\\xa0 Motta, however, was still largely underestimated when appointed as Bologna head coach in September 2022. The club dismissed the late great Siniša Mihajlović, much to the fanbase’s disdain, after winning none of their opening five league games of 2022-23. The ill-feeling grew when Motta was unable to win any of his first four matches,\\xa0causing an almighty stir at the Dall’Ara. The Rossoblù had dropped to 17th in the league table, but things soon clicked for Motta. He gradually earned the adoration of the Bologna faithful last season, steering the side well clear of the relegation zone and into the top half. He’d implemented a completely new style of play in Emilia-Romagna, with his possession-based philosophy attracting many plaudits. And rightly so, as Bologna sealed ninth spot in Serie A last term, their highest top-flight finish in 11 years.\\xa0\\xa0 Remarkably, Motta’s team have kicked on even further this season, as they occupy fifth place and sit just a point off the top four. In fact, their total of 32 points after 19 games is their best tally at this stage of a Serie A campaign in the three-points-for-a-win era (since 1994-95). This is despite the departures of key players Marko Arnautović, Nicolás Domínguez and Jerdy Schouten last summer. The seven-time Italian champions have been reinvigorated by Motta and the workings of technical director Giovanni Sartori, the architect of the Atalanta team that reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2019-20.\\xa0\\xa0 Bologna have developed into one of the most progressive teams in Italy under Motta, who shifted\\xa0from their previous 3-5-2 system into a dynamic 4-2-3-1. His side look to dominate games and exert pressure on the opposition through control of the ball, with Bologna boasting the third-highest possession share in the division this season (56.8%) while attempting more passes than any other Serie A side (10,175).\\xa0\\xa0 Their possession is facilitated by continuous rotations to utilise space and provide progression between the lines. They’ve had 280 open-play sequences comprising 10 or more passes, with only Inter recording more in the league (296). Motta deploys several modern principles, with his side constantly moving to create third-man combinations and provide numerical superiority over the opposition. This enables them to bypass their opponents’ press and work the ball into dangerous positions, with only three teams recording more forward passes than Bologna’s 3,070 in Serie A across 2023-24, and they’ve completed more passes in their own half than any other side in the Italian top flight (4,938).\\xa0 The team’s patterns of play under Motta are geared towards maintaining possession and acting as protagonists with the ball, explaining how they’ve had the second-most ball touches of any Serie A side\\xa0this term (13,557), behind only reigning champions Napoli (13,580). Bologna operate with a clear identity and adopt a patient build-up to lure opposition pressure, which is partially demonstrated by them having the second-lowest direct speed upfield in the division this term (1.65 metres per second), with only Monza going about their business in a more considered manner (1.62m/s).\\xa0\\xa0 However, after consolidating possession, Bologna then seek to transition with intensity. Their centre-backs are integral as they invert into midfield to create passing lanes, which has been extremely well executed by defender Riccardo Calafiori. The 21-year-old has been one of the revelations of the season at the Dall’Ara. Signed as a full-back from Basel in the summer, Motta has transformed Calafiori into one of the most sought-after central defenders in Italy. He and his central-defensive partner often advance into the opposition half with neat interchanges to set their side on the front foot, though that does not mean Calafiori shirks his defensive responsibilities as only Alberto Dossena (128) has won possession on more occasions than Calafiori (108) among defenders.\\xa0 Motta’s side then look to attack proactively with vertical passes and rapidly transition from back-to-front. Forward Joshua Zirkzee expertly leads the line, providing a constant out-ball with his terrific hold-up play. He\\xa0conducts forward moves by dropping deep before threading passes into the paths of forward runners or simply bringing teammates into play, with his 34 successful layoffs this term second only Marcus Thuram’s 35. The 22-year-old’s quick feet allow him to operate in tight spaces as well, prompting many of Bologna’s instinctive free-flowing forays forward.\\xa0\\xa0 Key to the Dutchman’s great start to life at the club has been his on-pitch rapport with attacking midfielder Lewis Ferguson. The Scotland international plays just behind the striker and constantly drifts into the half spaces, dragging markers out of position to\\xa0create space for Zirkzee. But Ferguson offers a considerable threat in his own right. Having recently overtaken the great Denis Law as the highest-scoring Scot in Serie A history after netting his 11th league goal for the Rossoblù, Ferguson has the highest non-penalty expected goals (xG) total (3.84) and joint-most shots (37) among midfielders in Serie A this term.\\xa0 Meanwhile, Bologna’s wingers maintain their width by hugging the touchline and isolating defenders one-on-one, ensuring only Napoli (26.2 metres) have a greater absolute width per sequence than Motta’s side this season (25.8m). And with Zirkzee operating as a false nine, their dynamic wide players attempt to flood the space left in behind with penetrative runs.\\xa0\\xa0 In fact, this ability to alternate attacking movements that instil doubt and disorganise opposition defences is a key facet of Motta’s setup. Bologna boast the third-highest passing accuracy in the opposition’s half in Serie A (80.2%), which showcases just how decisive they can be in transition, and yet they manage to maintain a high level of control and resist most urges to go long, with a\\xa0staggering 91.4% of their passes kept short, the joint-highest percentage in the Italian top-flight (alongside Milan); they are consistently intentional with the ball as they attempt to dictate games rather than rush into decisions. Unsurprisingly then, they have played the third-fewest long passes (872)\\xa0in Serie A across 2023-24.\\xa0\\xa0 But they’re not infallible. Probably their biggest issue this term has been a degree of\\xa0bluntness in the final third. They have only the 10th highest non-penalty xG (20.1)\\xa0in the division,\\xa0the sixth-fewest touches in the opposition box (354) and have played the fewest\\xa0passes into the box (416).\\xa0\\xa0 Furthermore, Bologna\\xa0have only registered more shots than seven other Serie A teams this season. Sure, their 83 shots on target is the seventh most and they boast the second-best shooting accuracy (50.3%, behind Milan on 52.5%), evidence of them actually being quite effective when opportunities arise, but the overarching issue is a lack of creative ingenuity or subtlety that could be their undoing in the long run.\\xa0 Certainly, there doesn’t look to be much danger of Bologna’s defence being a problem at this point, as they’ve been one of the most solid sides in Italy’s top tier. They’ve conceded the third fewest goals in the division (16), which is their lowest at this stage of the season since 1979-80 (15 goals). Motta’s team are extremely well organised and tough to break down, conceding the third-lowest xG against this campaign (16.9). They deploy a low block, which is unusual in comparison to the modern concepts that they adopt in possession, and are one of just three sides yet to make an error leading to a goal in Serie A alongside Napoli and Fiorentina. They’ve also faced the fourth-fewest shots on target (64) and their eight clean sheets in Serie A is already as many as they managed in the entirety of last season. \\xa0 But it’s not just the backline that’s responsible for their impressive defensive record. Bologna defend from the front with their pressing, aiming to suffocate opponents into mistakes. This doesn’t necessarily translate into lots of turnovers in the final third, or high turnovers (115, ranked 15th), because they are often quite deep, but on average Bologna allow their opponents just 11.6 passes before engaging with a defensive action (PPDA), Fiorentina (10.7) and Napoli (11.3) being the only two Serie A teams to press with greater intensity. The Rossoblù have attempted more tackles (326) than any other side, though, further evidence of their spirited approach off the ball. \\xa0 All the various nuances of their tactical style help identify the reasons behind what has\\xa0been the best season – so far – for Bologna in recent memory. Three league defeats is their fewest at this stage of a campaign since they last went on to win the title in 1963-64 (one defeat in their first 19 games), and their 10-match unbeaten streak earlier this term was their longest in Serie A since a run between December 1979 and March 1980.\\xa0 Their assault on the top half of the table, coupled with the fact Motta only has less than six months remaining on his current deal, has turned the heads of several big clubs around Europe. However, Motta is adamant his focus is fully on securing European football for Bologna for the first time since reaching the last 32 of the 1999-2000 UEFA Cup; the Opta supercomputer\\xa0gives them a 41.1% chance of maintaining their form and finishing in the top six.\\xa0 Nevertheless, it’s only natural that the ever-dwindling term on his contract at the Dall’Ara contributes to uncomfortable uncertainty for Bologna. All they can do is hope to keep reaping the rewards of one of the most promising head coaches in European football for as long as they have him. Only one thing’s for certain; no one’s mocking Motta now. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

His form has led to links to many of Europe’s biggest clubs, but in the short term, it looks like he could fire his current club to silverware. I can’t guarantee anything, what I can say is that if any player leaves [this window] it’s through a release clause. Our idea is to not sell anyone in January… I’m calm about it. Those are the recent words of Sporting CP manager Rúben Amorim, who was addressing the growing interest in star striker Viktor Gyökeres. The 25-year-old Swede has only been in Portugal since August and already his name has been strongly linked with a moves to some of Europe’s elite, and for very good reason. Gyökeres has been in phenomenal form since arriving at the Estádio José Alvalade, scoring 20 goals and providing nine assists in 23 matches. With Sporting perched at the top of the Primeira Liga, one point clear of city rivals Benfica and five clear of Porto in third, and into the knockout stages of both domestic cup competitions and the UEFA Europa League, it is Gyökeres that has given the Sportinguistas belief that he can be the man to drive them to their 20th top-flight title and their first since 2020-21. The Sporting faithful have fallen in love with their new man, serenading him with a song each time he steps on and off the Alvalade turf.\\xa0 🔊 | It’s safe to say Viktor Gyökeres likes his song from the Sporting fans.🇸🇪  pic.twitter.com/xlATkFMgrU Back in the summer, his move to Sporting felt somewhat surprising. The Sweden international was heavily linked to clubs in the Premier League after a stellar season in the Championship with Coventry City that saw him not only find the back of the net 21 times, but also finish the season with 12 assists – with no player in the league providing more. His overall goal involvement tally (33) was three more than any other player in the division. So, what Coventry had on their hands was a ruthless goalscorer who is equally adept at creating for teammates and has a physical profile that is unquestionably suited to English football. At this point, a step up into the Premier League seemed almost inevitable. That was until Sporting, one of Portugal’s Os Três Grandes – or ‘big three’ – threw their name into the hat; a club willing to smash their transfer record to bring this dynamic talent to Lisbon. Sporting offered the lure of European football, something the Swede had yet to taste, and a project guided by Amorim with lofty aims of once more capturing the league title – something they have only done once since 2002. Sporting pulled the trigger and splashed out big, paying €20 million plus a possible €4 million in add-ons to secure Gyökeres’ signature. It was the first time the club had paid €20m or more for a single player. Sporting have consistently been outscored by their big-three rivals, Porto and Benfica, especially in recent times. In their title-winning campaign in 2020-21, their first since 2001-02, Sporting scored 65 goals to Porto’s 74 and Benfica’s 69. In the seasons that have followed, Sporting finished second in the Portuguese top flight (2021-22), scoring 73 goals, 13 fewer than winners Porto and five fewer than Benfica. Last season, Sporting dropped to fourth, finishing 13 points behind league winners Benfica and finding themselves (71) outscored by Benfica (82), Porto (73) and Braga (75). Across the last four seasons, Sporting haven’t seen many players hit 10+ goals: two players in 2022-23: Francisco Trincão (10) and Pedro Gonçalves (15); two in 2020-21: Paulinho (11) and Pablo Sarabia (15); one in 2020/21: Pedro Gonçalves (23); and none in 2019-20. In February 2021, Sporting broke their then-club record to bring Braga’s Paulinho to the club with the hope that he would help share the goalscoring load with Gonçalves, but since he signed for the club, he has found the back of the net just 26 times in 80 appearances. Seven other players in the division have outscored him in this period. In the two-and-a-half year period between him and Gyökeres joining, few players scored consistently for Sporting. In Gyökeres, Sporting saw a solution to their goalscoring issues, a player who could help shift the club away from an overreliance on Paulinho and Gonçalves and be the standout star to fire them back up the table and to Primeira Liga glory. So far, he is doing exactly that. This season, Gyökeres is currently averaging a goal or an assist every 70.8 minutes, which is the best average for a Sporting CP player (500+ mins played) in a single season since Opta’s full coverage of the Primeira Liga started in 2016-17. In the league alone, the 26-year-old has scored 11 goals from an expected goals (xG) of just 7.16, giving him an overperformance of 3.84 – the biggest overperformance of any player in the division. Of players to have had at least big chances this term – chances the player would be expected to score – Gyökeres has the joint-best big chance conversion rate in the league, boasting a very healthy 66.67%, having scored eight of his 12 big chances so far this season. When looking at how he has fared across all competitions, the numbers are even more impressive. In the UEFA Europa League, the former Coventry man has three goals and one assist in five matches; in the Portuguese League Cup (Taça da Liga), he has three goals in one match; and in the Portuguese Cup (Taça de Portugal) he has three goals in two appearances. Add those numbers to the 11 goals and eight assists he has amassed in his 15 league matches and he ends up with a very impressive total of 29 goal contributions (20G 9A) in just 23 matches. Fans of the big three in Portugal will tell you that a surefire way for a player to become adored by the supporters is by making an impact in the matches against the other big sides. On Gyökeres’ first ever visit to the Estádio da Luz, the home of fierce city rivals Benfica, in November, he fired his side ahead on the stroke of half-time, and as the match went on, it looked like he had secured Sporting all three points. That was until Benfica scored a dramatic double in injury-time to snatch the victory from the Lions. Fast forward to December, and Sporting welcomed Porto to the Estádio José Alvalade. Once again, Gyökeres was on hand to score the opening goal, the only difference being that this time the Swede made sure he ended up on the winning side, helping his side further by providing an assist for Pedro Gonçalves in the second half to seal a vital 2-0 win. It meant that in two league games against Benfica and Porto, he has two goals and one assist. His opening goal against Porto served as the perfect example of what the Swedish international is good at. He was able to use his pace to burst down the left channel to latch on to a pass, had the composure to bring the ball under control while under pressure from veteran Pepe, was able to feint before taking the ball to the side of the Porto defender before unleashing a fierce effort in at the near-post past Portugal’s number one Diogo Costa. Gyökeres was already well on his way to becoming a hero at the Alvalade, but goals like this one only serve to expedite the process. It’s not just for his goalscoring exploits that Gyökeres has gained plaudits; the striker has firmly established himself as someone who can also create high-quality chances for others, leading the Primeira Liga assists charts this season (eight). In his most recent league match against Estoril, Gyökeres became the first player to provide a hat-trick of assists in a single Primeira Liga match this season, and also the first Sporting player to achieve this feat since Bruno Fernandes versus Portimonense back in 2019. With a strong physical presence and a desire to get on the ball and run at the opposition, Gyökeres is a nightmare for defenders when he picks up the ball and drives forward into attacking areas, whether that be through the middle or down the left flank, where he likes to drift. It’s from out wide that Gyökeres will often look to cut the ball back across the penalty area, usually aiming for someone at the back post or on the edge of the box. Two of his three assists against Estoril came in this manner – one from the left and one from the right – after he’d made his way into the box and had the intelligence to pick out Marcus Edwards, who was in a better position on both occasions. The two lines closest to the opposition’s goal on the below graphic represent these two assists vs Estoril. The 25-year-old ranks top of the Primeira Liga this season for carries with a take-on – moving at least five metres with the ball and then taking on an opponent – with 46, fourth for carries ending in a shot (14), and second for carries ending with an assist (3), rubbing shoulders with the likes of Ángel Di María, Rafa Silva and Edwards in all three columns. His willingness to take on players is a huge asset for Sporting. In fact, only Estoril’s Rafik Guitane (54) has completed more dribbles this season than Gyökeres’ 36. So, what next for the Swedish hitman? In Gyökeres, Sporting have a player that is more than capable of leading them to a league title. They paid big money in the hopes of finding a difference-maker in the final third, and so far that is exactly what they have got. Sporting have a Taça da Liga semi-final at the end of January against Braga, are into the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal and have a UEFA Europa League knockout playoff tie against Young Boys to come in February. If their star man continues in the form he’s been in of late, Sporting will certainly fancy their chances of ending this season with some silverware. It’s safe to say Gyökeres, a player who has yet to win major silverware in his career – and none at all since winning the Swedish second division in 2017 – needs no extra motivation. Beyond that, there is no reason to say he couldn’t end up in one of Europe’s big five leagues before long. Enjoy this?

Morocco impressed everyone at the 2022 World Cup, but can they go on to win the AFCON? They face a stiff test in a group alongside tricky opponents DR Congo and Zambia, while Tanzania are the outsiders. Two matches brought Morocco down to earth last June after the dizzying heights of reaching the World Cup semi-final in 2022: a goalless draw with Cape Verde and then a jarring loss to South Africa. But it was how they drew 1-1 with Cote d’Ivoire in October that seemed to jolt the North African country into the realisation that they could not bask in World Cup euphoria forever. That said, history seems to be on the side of the Atlas Lions as they chase a first AFCON title since 1976. When Cameroon danced their way to the 1990 World Cup quarter-final, they followed it with a 1992 AFCON semi-final place. Senegal’s 2002 World Cup heroics were followed by a quarter-final finish at AFCON 2004, and Ghana’s 2010 World Cup semi-final journey preceded an AFCON 2012 semi-final berth. So, then, Morocco can expect to finish in the quarter-final, at least? “If we finish in anything less than the AFCON semi-final, I will leave the job,” coach Walid Regragui told French media early last year. That bullish tone was before the draw with Ivory Coast, after which Regragui’s stance changed. “We are not favourites to win the AFCON,” he would then be widely quoted as saying. However, with a team in form, and being the neutrals’ favourite, Morocco will find it hard to convince anyone that this is not their AFCON to lose – especially when the host nation, Ivory Coast, is home to a large Moroccan community and the North Africans have so much going for them. A man not short of confidence, Regragui balances belief with copious doses of humility, too. His paradoxical nature should not be a surprise; he knows what heady wins and crushing failures feel like. As a player, he was part of the Morocco team that reached the final of AFCON 2004. And with the whole nation expecting a similar performance or better in 2006, he – and a team including ex-Arsenal man Marouane Chamakh, UEFA Champions League legend Noureddine Naybet and others – crashed out at the group stage. Should he win this tournament, Regragui will become only the second man in history, behind Egypt’s Mahmoud El Gohary, to win the African Champions League and the AFCON as a coach. Being French-born and trained, the 48-year-old however got his coaching education and opportunity in Africa. With a 27-man squad made up of both European- and Moroccan-born players, Regragui is the perfect man to gel together the different mentalities at play. But why is there so much pressure on this team? In the last decade, over $120 million has been spent by the football-obsessed King of Morocco and the government on improving infrastructure, talent identification and capacity building. The result has been a period of dominance of Moroccan football on multiple levels, with two CAF Champions Leagues, four CAF Confederations Cups, a second-place finish at the 2022 Women’s AFCON, a first-ever qualification to last year’s Women’s World Cup and the Women’s under-17 World Cup. Considering that fierce rivals Algeria won an AFCON in 2019, while Egypt are AFCON royalty, football fans in Morocco believe it is now or never. Group F is perfect for Morocco: not too easy, not too tough. And with a balanced team, the North Africans can play as the intense pressing and counter-attacking machine they’ve evolved into from the low-block style at the World Cup. In Qatar, the Atlas Lions were content with combining minimal possession (37.8% was the sixth lowest) with quick counters as they faced technically superior teams. At this tournament, the same will be done to them. A growing concern is the lack of efficiency, with the team scoring 38 goals in their last 28 games (averaging 1.4 goals per game), dating back to the start of the last AFCON. “We simply have to be more clinical, because it has become a habit since the World Cup that we create so many chances, but convert so little,” says former goalie Nadir Lamyaghri. “It is not normal that with the players we have, we struggle to score loads of goals.” At the last AFCON in 2021, Morocco had the third-best non-penalty expected goals (xG) per 90 average of 1.54, but scored just six non-penalty goals in their five games (1.13 per 90). At the 2022 World Cup, they were even less clinical, scoring 9.8% of their shots – 0.2% lower than at the last Africa Cup of Nations. That’ll need to change if they are to succeed here. Morocco have the quality to break down any opponent, with talents such as Achraf Hakimi, Hakim Ziyech and Bologna’s talented defensive midfielder Oussama El Azzouzi. Expect the Atlas Lions to start in a 4-1-4-1 formation at this tournament. Yassine Bounou should be in goal with Attiat Allah at left-back instead of Bayern’s Noussair Mazraoui (recovering from injury), while captain Roman Saïss (who famously lost his father during AFCON 2017 but insisted on playing and then scored) is a guaranteed starter at centre-back alongside West Ham’s Nayef Aguerd. Manchester United’s Sofiane Amrabat should start in defensive midfield and Azzedine Ounahi (arguably the team’s most important player behind Hakimi) further ahead. Selim Amallah can play anywhere in midfield together with the very technical Amine Harit or Bilal El Khannous. On the right of midfield Ziyech should start, while Leverkusen’s Amine Adli can pip the recently-injured Boufal to spot on the left side of attacking midfield.\\xa0 For the first time in his international career, the untouchable Youssef En-Nesyri (Sevilla) has credible competition up front from Olympiacos’ Ayoub El Kaabi (who has seven goals in the Greek Super League this season) and Gent’s nine-goal forward Tarik Tissoudali (who missed the World Cup due to injury but was key in Morocco’s World Cup qualification). En-Nesyri remains favourite because of his incredible work rate and defensive contribution.\\xa0 The team’s undisputed star is Hakimi, who from right-back has been the one world-class player that can be counted on in tough times. The PSG man is evolving into a Philip Lahm, Joshua Kimmich or Javier Zanetti, and we may see him contributing to more midfield duties as the tournament progresses. The full-back is the most creative Ligue 1 defender from open play so far this season, with 24 chances created and four assists. The Atlas Lions know they have a poor AFCON record – four semi-finals in 20 appearances – and traditionally don’t do well when the tournament is hosted in West Africa. Will their luck change? The glory days are long gone. In 1968 and 1974, DR Congo won the tournament in a previous guise, but very few Congolese today have any memories of those days. It’s just stories. “It has become important for us to write songs of today that can be sung by today’s people,” said the recently-retired legendary DRC forward Trésor Mputu Mabi. “Even when I led the team to bronze in 2015, that was not enough, because we need to be more consistent.” Since the turn of the century, DR Congo have somehow had a sorry AFCON story despite being stacked with talent: three group stage exits, then failure to qualify for three consecutive tournaments between 2008 and 2012, an inexplicable round of 16 crash against Madagascar in 2019, and not making it to the last edition at all. In came Sébastien Desabre, a man known to work well with scarce resources. League titles in Angola, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Tunisia preceded a stint with Uganda, who he led to an improbable last-16 finish at AFCON 2019. The 47-year-old inherited a DRC side in a bit of pickle left by Héctor Cúper, and the Leopards were bottom of their qualifying group. Without a single point after two defeats to Gabon and Sudan, and on a seven-match winless streak, Desabre led his side to four successive AFCON qualifier wins and a first-place finish in Group I after taking over. Unlike the early 2000s, when businessmen invested in top teams to keep local talent in the country, the best DRC players now call Tanzania and Angola home. As a result, there has been an increasing focus on tapping up players from the Congolese diaspora, something Desabre has actively encouraged. He said in December: “DR Congo have always had outstanding players. But if we’re going to go to the next level, there’s no question that we need the players who are dual nationals to choose who they’re going to play for at an earlier age. “If you took all the Congolese players who are in France, Belgium and Sweden, you’d have an absolute dream team. The thing is, these young players don’t choose to play for DR Congo at an early age because we don’t really have a national team project to offer them when they’re kids.” The most high-profile name Desabre has been chasing is Manchester United’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who has represented DRC at U20 level and England at U21. For now, he still hopes to feature for the Three Lions, despite formidable competition at right-back from Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, and Tino Livramento. Despite this setback, DRC were able to convince French-born SC Braga forward Simon Banza and Swiss-born defensive midfielder Charles Pickel to switch nationalities, and the duo have brought variety to the side. Banza’s enjoyed a brilliant season in the Portuguese top flight, leading the scoring charts with 14 goals at the time of writing and posting a league-high expected goals total (10.2), shot conversion (29.8%) and minutes-per-goal ratio (76). Preferring to play a 4-3-2-1, DRC will likely start Lionel Mpasi in goal, with Arthur Masuaku at left-back. Captain Chancel Mbemba, in great form with Marseille, should pair with Henoc Inonga Baka while either of Gedeon Kalulu or Joris Kayembe fills in at right-back. The wonderfully named Sammy Moutoussamy and Charles Pickel are the preferred defensive midfielders, and ex-Chelsea man Gael Kakuta has been great as a fulcrum. Brentford’s Yoane Wissa and Meschak Elia should be left and right wingers respectively. Wissa has been a positive in a somewhat shaky Premier League season for an Ivan Toney-less Brentford alongside Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo, who misses AFCON 2023 with injury. He’s their second-top scorer in league competition with four goals, while only Vitaly Janelt (23) has created more chances for the Bees from open play than Wissa (15). It is up front that things get interesting, though. Previous DRC sides of the last decade had medium-to-tall centre-forwards such as Cédric Bakambu, Neeskens Kebano and Dieumerci Mbokani. Now, they have the handful that is Silas Mvumpa. Imposing, fast, and capable of playing as a left or right winger, too, the 6-foot-2 Stuttgart man is deceptively mobile and deadly. If unavailable, they can look to Fiston Mayele, who is quick, technically very good and has an eye for a killer pass.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The main weakness of this team is their defending. Even though they conceded just four goals in qualifying, a stronger side will lay their set-piece deficiencies bare, while their full-backs are either too static or too adventurous – they need balance. The last time Zambia won a match at the AFCON, the trophy followed them to Lusaka. That was in February 2012, and the Chipolopolo then exited at the group stage of the following two tournaments. More woe came when they failed to qualify for the following three editions. Now, they are back for the first time since 2015, and with former Chelsea boss Avram Grant in tow. “All I have done is to keep the team calm and focused,” the Israeli told ZBC Sports in his usual understated way after booking the AFCON ticket. It’s typical of a man who is more known for his man management than for his tactical acumen. Grant’s jovial disposition makes underrating him easy, but leading Ghana to the final and fourth place in 2015 and 2017 respectively suggests the 68-year-old knows his African onions. Indeed, Grant has barely added new talent to the Zambian team he inherited, instead focusing on improving the existing set. Lameck Banda had just moved from Israel to Italy when Grant took the job in December 2022, and the quick forward became a credible attacking option. But the poster boy of the Grant era is midfielder Kelvin Kapumbu, who plays for Zambian top-flight side Zesco United. (A warning to commentators: the squad has another midfielder called Kelvin Kampamba, who also plays for Zesco United, and is also 27!) Previously prone to getting yellow and red cards, Kapumbu now channels his energies into intelligent runs, assisting with defensive duties and visionary play. When injury forced him to miss two games in November against Niger (Zambia lost 2-0) and Congo (won 4-2), his absence was conspicuous. “When I saw Kelvin at first, I actually did not think much of him. But I figured he had something, so I worked with him and – credit to him – he’s grabbed the opportunity,” Grant said recently. Zambia topped their qualifying group with a game to spare in the qualifiers, which included tournament hosts Ivory Coast, Comoros, and Lesotho with four wins, a draw, and just one loss in six matches, bagging 13 points in the process. “With Grant in charge, meritocracy has become the standard,” Zambian sports analyst Puncherello Chama says. “This has reflected on the morale in camp because the players know consistency is being rewarded.” That consistency has led to a quiet expectation that the Chipolopolo will come second to expected Group F winners, Morocco. Key to this hope is Leicester City striker Patson Daka, who contributed five goals in AFCON qualifying. The 25-year-old was a 2017 U20 AFCON winner and says that the senior team “is going to [Ivory Coast] with the mindset and belief that we can do anything we want.” His partner up front will be Saudi-based Fashion Sakala, who finished 2023 as the highest Zambian scorer across all competitions (club and country) with 22 goals and 11 assists in 52 appearances. Look out for Crvena Zvezda’s 24-year-old midfielder Kings Kangwa, and captain Lubambo Musonda, who is “positive and confident in the team to go all the way to the final and win it.” Lecce’s Lameck Banda is one to watch at this tournament, with the winger one of the most prolific dribblers in Serie A this season. He averages a similar number of take-ons (7.2 per 90) to Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (7.4) but completes more than the Georgian (3.2 vs 2.9) and only Matías Soulé has averaged more successful take-ons per 90 in Serie A this season (3.9) than Banda. Zambia usually go 4-3-3. Lawrence Mulenga is the most consistent Zambian goalkeeper, with Benedict Chepeshi at right-back and Rodrick Kabwe at left-back. Stoppila Sunzu, the only remaining member of the victorious 2012 AFCON squad pairs his vast centre-back experience with Ayr United’s Frankie Musonda, the only player in the squad not born in Zambia. The previously mentioned Kapumbu usually partners Emmanuel Banda, whose talent is long-range shots. Another recent revelation of this team is the exciting playmaker Kangwa. The Crvena Zvezda man took over this position from the stricken Enock Mwepu, the Brighton player forced to retire due to heart problems in 2022. Back in September 2023, Kangwa became just the seventh Zambian player to appear in the UEFA Champions League. A tricky group awaits, and despite having a squad of not-so-popular names, captain Musonda reckons Zambia “have a team that is able to fight; a team that is able to give their best.” Every AFCON, there is always that one team that wins the did-they-just-call-this random-player-into-the-national-team bingo. Tanzania win this edition with a player in the seventh tier of English football and two players from the fifth tier – but more about that later. The Taifa Stars qualified for the tournament by the skin of their teeth, which pretty much sums up the grit that has characterised Tanzanian football in the last decade. After waiting almost 40 years to reappear at the AFCON following their 1980 debut, the investment in growing the game has led to a second appearance (and third overall) in three editions. Simba SC and Young Africans (aka Yanga), the nation’s two club giants, have emerged as credible forces on the African club scene, with regular forays into the business end of the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup. Yanga reached the final of the Confederation Cup last season, losing to Algerian side USM Alger. This steady overall improvement has had a significant impact on the national team – but there’s a catch. Both clubs currently feature within the top 15 African sides in the Opta Power Rankings. Although the Tanzania Premier League is one of Africa’s most vibrant, with exciting atmospheres, a knowledgeable fan base and attractive compensation for players and teams, the quality in the Taifa Stars is still some distance from matching the league’s output. “The league’s very best players come from outside the country because clubs can afford to pay such talent,” says Hans van der Pluijm, a Dutch man who has coached in the local top flight since 2014. “Even though administrators are investing well in the top leagues, they need some deliberate policies at grassroots level to consistently produce quality players for the national team,” adds Privaldinho, a popular Tanzanian journalist. In effect, even though Tanzania can be proud to be the only East African nation at this tournament, a lack of depth is the reason they are expected to exit at the group stage. Will they be able to do better than the one point in six games from the last two editions? Tanzania booked their AFCON ticket not by playing excellent football, but by doing just enough to qualify on the last day in a group that included Algeria, Uganda, and Niger. Coach Adel Amrouche struggles with a distinct defensive naivety, and a side that tends to switch off after the hour mark. Full-backs Dickson Job and Novatus Miroshi are prone to leaving spaces that can exploited, and the team can be unimaginative in its build-up. Knowing they are the most unfancied team in Group F, Tanzania embarked recently on a search of players to shore up the existing core, which is how Swedish-born goalkeeper Kwesi Zion Kawawa made his debut in a World Cup qualifier against Morocco last November. From England’s fifth tier come three diasporans. Haji Mnoga, 21, who has represented England’s U17 side, plays for Aldershot Town and made his national team debut in March 2022. Then there’s Tarryn Allarakhia from Wealdstone, who has been called up for the first time. Finally, there’s another English National League inclusion in Mohammed Sagaf, a Somali-born playmaker at Boreham Wood. It’s his first-ever call-up, too. The most eye-raising, however, are Anthony Ben Starkie, who plays for Ilkeston Town in England’s seventh tier, and Miano Danilo, who plays for a provincial club in the south of Spain. To be fair, Starkie has previously played for Tanzania’s U17 and was part of the squad at the U20 AFCON in 2020, but questions have been raised about whether the thriving Tanzanian Premier League could not produce a better attacking midfielder.\\xa0 Former Aston Villa striker Mbwana Samatta and Algeria-based striker Simon Msuva, ranking second and third respectively in Tanzania’s all-time top scorers’ list, are ones to watch in this team. They scored Tanzania’s only two goals in their last AFCON appearance in 2019, in a 3-2 group stage defeat to Kenya. Samatta has been the darling boy for the last decade, but he’s not been good for the national team for a while, having last scored in 2019. He’s not been too hot in front of goal at club level this season either, with just two goals in 14 Greek Super League appearances for PAOK (across 673 minutes). He’ll need to be at his best to help the Taifa Stars advance out of Group F. Want more AFCON preview content?

Can the Tunisian’s cause a shock and replicate their only Africa Cup of Nations success to date (2004)? The Carthage Eagles go into this AFCON with one medium-term hope: to avoid Burkina Faso in the later rounds if possible. The north Africans have never beaten the Stallions, who have been responsible for some of their biggest heartbreaks. But before the two teams might meet, Tunisia need to deal with what’s in front of them. They are consistent quarter-finalists, having been there in nine of the last 10 editions. This is their 16th consecutive qualification and their 21st AFCON appearance overall. It has become common for Tunisian fans to see their team at the tournament, but there’s now a real thirst for another trophy since the 2004 title won on home soil. Will it be this year? “The way the team is set, you know we will go past the group stage. Winning the whole tournament has perhaps come too soon,” says Salam Sidiki, a Tunisian journalist. “The football we are playing now is not at the AFCON-winning level and our coach does not have what it takes.” Between 2017 and 2019, Tunisia played some uncharacteristically lovely football under coaches Henryk Kasperczak and Alain Giresse. Since then, they’ve reverted to the type of gritty, results-based football for which they are known. Tunisia will miss the experience of veteran Wahbi Khazri, with the 32-year-old retiring from the national team in 2022. Hannibal Mejbri of Manchester United has opted out of the squad, saying he wants to sort out his future by playing minutes at club level. Elias Saad, a decent forward at St Pauli, has been blacklisted by the Federation for attempting to pick and choose when to play. Despite the absences of these players, Tunisia will likely be fine. They don’t call them the Uruguay of African sport for nothing. Despite a population of ‘just’ 12 million (small in the context of African countries), they are the most successful handball nation, are African champions in basketball, the reigning African volleyball champions and, of course, they have Ons Jabeur – the most visible African tennis player now, male or female. This will be Jalel Kadri’s first AFCON. Widely derided in his home country, he was a surprise appointment.  As an assistant of former coach Mondher Kebaier, Kadri’s claim to fame came at the last tournament, where – after Kebaier was hit with COVID on the eve of a round of 16 meeting with Nigeria – he shocked everyone against the then in-form west Africans. It wasn’t a pretty performance, but it did the job. The 52-year-old has not played professionally, but with a managerial career spanning 20 years, why is he not a popular choice? “Tunisia typically does not shine when local coaches are in charge,” says football writer Oluwada Lotfi. Indeed, critics have accused the Federation of finding cheap options, with Kadri among the lowest paid coaches in the last decade of Tunisian national team football. As group favourites, they will look to attack in a 4-3-3. Expect Béchir Ben Saïd in goal, Wajdi Kechrida at right-back and Ali Maâloul (a legendary defender with more than 50 goals and many more assists) at left-back. Centre-backs could be Yassine Meriah and Montassar Talbi. In midfield is the Bundesliga duo of Aïssa Laïdouni and Ellyes Skhiri in addition to Lecce’s Hamza Rafia. Upfront, there are many options. The domestic league duo of Haythem Jouini and Bassem Srarfi have earned a spot, but 33-year-old legend Youssef Msakni will is capable of a solid hour before being subbed. Then there’s the team’s most technical player, FC Copenhagen’s Elias Achouri. A fearless dribbler, the French-born player is certainly one to look at to carry the team in future. So far in the Danish Superligaen this season, he’s tallied a league-high seven assists and only two players have been involved in more shots following a ball carry than him (19). Of players to have played at least 500 minutes in the competition, he’s among the top 10 most prolific dribblers with an average of 5.5 take-ons per 90 minutes in the Danish top flight. Another to watch from the diaspora pool is recently debuted, Swiss-born Sayfallah Ltaief, who is an explosive and tricky midfielder. With a balanced squad like this, it is no wonder that the coach Kadri has boldly predicted that “the minimum the public should expect is a semi-final finish.” If he does not reach that target, he will be sacked. Éric Chelle says he does not care if Mali win the tournament; he just wants them to be respected. It is not an odd take from the former captain of the Eagles, who has now been in charge for about 18 months. Mali are respected on the continent for their prolific production line of talent, in addition to a burgeoning reputation in youth football. However, at senior level they have no trophy to show for it, nor have they made a single FIFA World Cup appearance. Across their last eight AFCON appearances, the Eagles have crashed out in the group stages four times, and been knocked out in the last 16 in the last two. Embarrassingly, they exited the 2021 tournament after defeat to Equatorial Guinea. After five years in charge, Mohamed Magassouba was sacked. Mali finished third in last year’s U17 World Cup after getting to the quarter-finals of the 2019 U20 World Cup as well. It has been just reward for a country with one of the most prolific youth development programs in West Africa. And yet, they simply cannot put in consistent AFCON performances. Opta’s supercomputer AFCON predictions give the Eagles a 76% chance of getting into the last 16 and 39.4% chance of making the quarter-final at the time of writing. Hopes of breezing past the group stage suffered a setback as injuries have distorted Mali’s plans. Top striker Ibrahima Koné will be sorely missed upfront after he twisted an ankle in a friendly against Uganda in October. Crystal Palace’s Cheick Doucouré will miss out after having surgery on an Achilles tendon injury while Atalanta forward El Bilal Touré has still not recovered from a thigh injury. Also sidelined are Lens full-back Massadio Haïdara and former Southampton winger Moussa Djenepo, now at Standard Liege in Belgium. These injuries have raised expectations for Tottenham’s Yves Bissouma, who has established himself as a top Premier League midfielder with his passing and defensive abilities. Two consecutive Man of the Match performances in the first two matches of the season against Brentford and Manchester United did little to dim the 27-year-old’s hype. Bissouma was born in Ivory Coast, moved to Mali at 13, and is seen as a poster boy of the rising African star. Like Morocco’s Nayef Aguerd (West Ham) who featured prominently in domestic African football before making a name in the world’s biggest league, Bissouma is an inspiration for many locally based players. He has flourished under new Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou. Of players to play at least 800 minutes, Bissouma is among the top five midfielders for progressive ball carries per 90 in the Premier League this season, averaging 9.9 per 90 minutes, while only two midfielders have averaged more tackles in the competition this season than his 3.7 per 90. He is part of a technical Mali midfield that includes Amadou Haidara, Aliou Dieng, Mohamed Camara, Lassana Coulibaly, Moussa Doumbia, and Adama Traoré of Hull City. They also have the option of Boubacar Traoré as one of the many options in a talented midfield. Mali’s best finish was at the 1972 Nations Cup, where they finished second largely due to some stout defending. The current team are also solid defensively, but although they were the second highest scorers in qualifying, finding goals will be an issue. Their lack of an out-and-out striker means they will be quite reliant on the midfield, as they are expected to line up in a 4-3-3. 1996 is so far away now, and after that heady win in their debut campaign, Bafana Bafana are yet to shine in the subsequent nine AFCON tournaments. This time, though, there is quiet confidence about South Africa. More than half of the squad currently play for Mamelodi Sundowns, who have been the most dominant club in South African club football over the last decade – Sundowns have won eight out of the last 10 top-flight titles. In addition to that, they’ve made nine straight African Champions League group stage appearances – a joint-record with Al Ahly and Wydad Casablanca and recently won the inaugural African Football League. The South African side are currently the top ranked club team in Africa based on the Opta Power Rankings: All this success has led coach Hugo Broos to do the smart thing by moulding the team around his Sundowns stars, despite initially having his own style which required players from other teams. “International football is about results, and there isn’t a long time to camp these players. If you’ve got players featuring at a high level already, why not adapt things around them?” Broos said recently. It is now becoming normal to see five or six Sundowns players in the South African starting lineup. Broos is most famous for masterminding Cameroon’s fifth AFCON title in 2019, and the Belgian immediately earned the respect of South African fans with a string of bold calls once he landed the job.\\xa0 But one thing he has yet to solve is South Africa’s problems in front of goal. Broos has had to adapt the team’s traditional style of relying on wingers and second strikers. In his own words, he’s learnt to rely on “players who can use their physique and who can play with their backs to the goal”, especially in away games. Sadly, the two players the team has relied on are both out. Scarcely had Lebo Mothiba picked up a patella injury with Strasbourg in December then more bad news rocked the squad. Lyle Foster – who was the side’s top scorer in the qualifiers – and the medical team at his club, Burnley, wrote to the South African authorities, informing them that Foster has been suffering from mental health issues. The 23-year-old has played a prominent role for his club since the announcement, but he will not be at the AFCON. Former South Africa captain Aaron Mokoena told local station Radio 2000: “The Premier League is a very high-pressure environment. How is he able to play there and not for the national team? If he doesn’t want to play for us, he should let us know.” This means the Orlando Pirates duo of Zakhele Lepasa and Evidence Makgopa will look to take up the mantle. Lepasa leads all Orlando Pirates players expected goals per 90 (0.63) in the South African Premier Division this season – in fact, just two players in Lucas Ribeiro Costa (0.70) and Augustine Kwem (0.69) average a higher rate than him. Lepasa will need to replicate his domestic form on the international stage. Themba Zwane, a veteran who has been included in the squad after he was initially overlooked by Broos, has not scored this season – registering just one assist in 648 minutes for the Sundowns – but remains a big influence for club and country. He’s good behind the main striker, running the channels and has an eye for a pass. Broos has conceded that it had been a mistake to sideline the now 34-year-old Zwane when he took over in May 2021, explaining that he had been trying to prioritise younger players at the time. It’ll likely be a 4-2-3-1, with Ronwen Williams in goal. The back four will be made up of Khuliso Mudau at right-back, a centre-back pairing of Mothobi Mvala and Siyanda Xulu, and Aubrey Modiba at left back. The midfield diamond is the strongest area of the team, with Sphephelo Sithole – who left South Africa after playing in the 2015 U17 World Cup and has been abroad in Portugal ever since) and Teboho Mokoena, who can lay claim to being the best all-round midfielder in Africa. Zwane can operate right in front of these two, behind Percy Tau and Thapelo Morena. Upfront will be Lepasa or Makgopa. This will be South Africa’s 11th AFCON appearance, and with a history of crashing out at the group stages or quarter-finals, there’s finally belief that this squad should go further. When Namibia beat Cameroon in a March 2023 AFCON qualifier, it is fair to say the southern African country went mad. A major newspaper, The Namibian Sun, went with the headline ‘Cameroon who? Bring on Brazil!’ With Kenya disqualified from Group C, this crucial win all but sealed qualification, such that a loss to Burundi in June did not really matter. Under the guidance of coach Collin Benjamin, the Brave Warriors emerged from a challenging qualification group that included powerhouses Cameroon and Burundi. The qualifying campaign showcased Namibia’s resilience, highlighted by a remarkable victory over Cameroon in Johannesburg and a commendable draw against the Indomitable Lions in Yaoundé. These pivotal moments secured the Brave Warriors’ second-place finish in the standings, with five points, just two behind group leaders Cameroon, and earned them the ticket to Côte d’Ivoire. Namibia’s football journey is set for a historic chapter as the Brave Warriors gear up for their fourth appearance at the AFCON. Previous participation in 1998, 2008, and 2019 all saw eliminations in the group stages. Despite the euphoria around qualification, there is an unspoken worry that this may be the last tournament for several senior players due to several factors, including repeated poor camping conditions, uncertain payments of bonuses and constantly haphazard transportation arrangements.\\xa0 Joviita Kandjumbwa, a broadcaster, says “we should expect the players to do anything at this point to show their displeasure”. With a lack of a clear bonus structure in place as late as the New Year, boycotts can happen at any time. For now, this team – most of who grew up together and are from a core which won Namibia’s first ever sub-regional COSAFA Cup title in 2015 – have a nation to make proud. There undisputed star has been striker Peter Shalulile of Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa, recognized as one of the premier players on the continent. Shalulile, recently nominated in the top three of the Inter-Club Player of the Year, produced a stellar performance during the qualifiers. He scored in every game, including back-to-back goals against Cameroon, positioning him as a player to watch at the upcoming tournament. He’s scored four and assisted two more in the South African top-flight so far this season. Oh, and he started his career in South Africa at left-back. Apart from Shalulile’s offensive prowess, the experience brought by players such as Petrus Shitembi, Absalom Iimbondi, Marcell Papama, and others who participated in the previous AFCON, will be crucial for Namibia. This blend of seasoned players and emerging talents creates a dynamic team capable of facing the challenges that lie ahead. Namibia’s AFCON history has been marked by the pursuit of that elusive first win. With two draws and seven losses in their nine appearances, the Brave Warriors are determined to rewrite their narrative, particularly after a disappointing showing in the 2019 edition in Egypt, where they suffered defeats in all group stage matches. Renowned for their disciplined defence and swift counter-attacks, Namibia bring a strategic play style to the tournament. The team, led by the experience of coach Benjamin and captain Denzil Haoseb, aim to surprise onlookers as they navigate through a formidable group featuring COSAFA rivals South Africa, Tunisia, and Mali. Benjamin knows Namibian football like the back of his hand. “I live it, I breathe it and hopefully, I will leave this earth proud of what I did for my country,” he told the state broadcaster following AFCON qualification, less than two years after taking the job in June 2022.\\xa0 He was part of each of the three Namibian squads to qualify for all their AFCON appearances, and it is a key reason why his players trust him. Shitembi told One Africa TV: “He’s been there and done that. He understands what we need to do, so we listen to him.” They should, especially when he has the record of being the only Namibian to have ever played in the UEFA Champions League for Hamburg. “Before we think of outplaying our opponents, we have to outplay our previous performances in the tournament. AFCON is our World Cup and our aim is to leave a mark,” Benjamin said after announcing his final squad. Aware of their lack of technical proficiency compared to the continent’s big boys, Namibia make no tactical pretensions. They play to their strengths, usually sitting back and hitting on the counter. Expect a 4-4-1-1, with Lloyd Kazapua in goal, Ananias Gebhardt and Denzil Haoseb in central defence and Riaan Hanamub at left-back. England-born Ryan Nyambe, a flying ful- back, is one of most cerebral players in the squad. The Derby County man can play both right and left-back positions well. In midfield, Ngero Katua will play centrally, potentially with the most experienced member of the squad in Petrus Shitembi, while Deon Hotto and Absalom Iimbondi take the left and right wings respectively. Destined for big things is Kosovo-based, 21-year-old wonderkid forward Prins Tjiueza. At his age, he wears the mythical 10 jersey and usually plays as a second striker for his country. Once Shalulile eventually leaves, there will be a lot of pressure on the youngster to deliver big-game performances. \\xa0“We as Namibians are a small country with a big heart, and if I am expected to make the country proud, that is what I will try hard to do all the time,” Tijueza told One Africa TV.

Algeria will look to make up for a terrible showing at the last edition, while Burkina Faso have made the semi-finals in three of the last five AFCON tournaments. Mauritania and Angola are the outsiders, but will be hoping to cause an upset. At the last Africa Cup of Nations tournament, Algeria served a masterclass in how not to defend a title. The Fennecs were unrecognisable from the team that slalomed to the 2019 trophy, due to being predictable as well as having a lack of freshness in the squad. It has also been suggested that being unbeaten in 35 games as of January 2022, Djamel Belmadi’s team were obsessed with besting Italy’s 37-game world record. “They seemed to be playing for a draw, rather than going for a win,” notes football journalist Oluwada Lotfi. That group stage exit was the wakeup call required, and the engines have been rebooted, bidding goodbye to veterans like 2014 BBC African Footballer of the Year Yacine Brahimi. There now seems to be a deliberate tilt toward youth, with just five notable players in this year’s AFCON squad over the age of 30: Sofiane Féghouli (now more box-to-box than attacking midfielder), Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani, the combative Baghdad Bounedjah and defensive stalwart Aïssa Mandi. Longstanding first choice keeper Rais Mbolhi, 37, who was approaching his 100th cap, got injured just as the final squad was announced. He’s replaced by Saudi-based Moustapha Zeghba. French Ligue 2 shot-stopper Anthony Mandréa, whose performance in a September friendly was commanding, will be in goal. Algeria have tried to fix notable flaws that allowed Sierra Leone, Equatorial Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire to gut them on the counter at the last AFCON. Belmadi, who was a bundle of nerves on the touchline at the last tournament, has to be calmer this time. At the 2021 AFCON, Algeria scored just one goal from shots totalling 4.9 expected goals (xG) in their three group stage games as they were sent home early. Their 2.2% shot conversion rate was only better than Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania (who didn’t score at all). A stickler for using a back four, the manager is expected to go with full-backs Youcef Atal of Nice and Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Rayan Aït-Nouri. Both are attack-minded but can be caught out defensively. Mandi is past his best, but Belmadi stubbornly sticks with him at centre-back. However, this defence has now conceded just eight goals in their last 19 games. There’s a quiet confidence returning to this hungry team. The Fennecs played 10 games in 2023, winning seven and drawing three. Key among the wins was a morale-boosting 1-0 away victory against reigning African champions Senegal, who had not lost at home in nearly 10 years before the game. Former Manchester City star Mahrez has lost none of his magic despite taking his talents to Saudi Arabia, and he’s a sure starter. Across the 2023-24 Saudi Pro League, the 32-year-old has both created the most chances for his Al-Ahli teammates in the competition (60) and has the highest expected assists (xA) total of 7.9. Despite Mahrez’s talents, the loss of Algeria’s top scorer in qualifying, Mohammed Amoura, to injury mid-December is a huge blow. He had 13 goals in 15 Belgian top-flight games for Union Saint-Gilloise before being sidelined. Goals, then, will have to come from veteran striker Slimani (the former Leicester City forward who now plays in Brazil with Coritiba) and the Qatar-based Bounedjah. The physically solid duo of Ismaël Bennacer (only just returning from a lengthy knee injury in December) and Nabil Bentaleb could man defensive midfield, while the experienced Sofiane Feghouli partners Youcef Belaïli just behind the main forwards. In 2015, Belaïli was controversially suspended for testing positive for cocaine, but since his return, has exploded. Algeria coach Belmadi trusted him when no one else did, and he’s now one of the highest paid players in Africa. Indeed, added to Feghouli and Belaïli, the team has two other players ready to slot in, depending on the opposition: Hicham Boudaoui (closer to Bennacer in style) and the exciting Farès Chaïbi from Eintracht Frankfurt, whose offensive midfield talent means he’ll be in a top tier European club soon.\\xa0 Look out also for Zinéddine Belaïd in central defence, one of the top defenders playing in Africa today. He may not start ahead of Mandi and Dortmund’s Ramy Bensebaïni, but he’s been ready for the big time for a while. Algeria know that despite finishing with 16 out of a possible 18 points in the qualifiers, they are far from guaranteed to bulldoze their way to a third AFCON title. At a time when many African nations are hoovering players up from the diaspora, Burkina Faso have stubbornly looked to homegrown options. Until fairly recently, it was common to have a significant number of key players of the national team, the Stallions, sourced from home. The explosion of well set-up private academies in the country (and in neighbouring Ivory Coast) that continue to churn out quality youth players means this practice will continue for a while longer. Local media have begun labelling the team ‘nearly men’, and it’s not hard to see why. In 2013, they lost 1-0 to Nigeria in the final and reached the semi-finals in 2017 and 2019. Led by a coach determined to exorcise his own AFCON demons, could Burkina Faso charge their way into the last four once more? Hubert Velud was probably thrilled at the good fortune of leading Togo’s most accomplished football generation, which included Emmanuel Adebayor, to the 2010 AFCON. That was before gunmen attacked the team bus two days before the tournament kicked off, leading to the team’s withdrawal.  Eleven years later, Velud was sacked by the Sudanese football federation on the eve of AFCON 2021 – despite qualifying them. The team had recorded a string of poor results in the months leading up to the tournament. Now, having qualified the Stallions for this edition, the 64-year-old is faced with mutiny from within. The heads of the country’s powerful Premier League clubs have been lobbying for his sacking since October. They accuse him of – in the words of ASFA Yennenga president Armand Béouindé – “nothing new and nothing fresh since he replaced [former coach] Melo Kamou.” Keep in mind that Melo was asked to step aside after a semi-final finish in Cameroon. Still, as we head into AFCON 2023, there has been no cogent reason given. As it stands, the only person standing in the way of a sacking for the Frenchman is the President of the Burkina Faso Football Federation, who took the bizarre decision to axe the very popular Melo Kamou. Bertrand Traoré remains the leader of the team, even though he’s barely had any playing time with Aston Villa this season. He is one of those players who assume god-like status when they pull on the national team kit. Even at 80% match readiness, he’ll likely start. In the last few months, Velud gave the 28-year-old limited minutes; yet, his goal and two assists contributed to the four point-haul to leave the team second in World Cup qualifying. There is always a temptation to play Traoré upfront, but at the last AFCON he flopped in that role and thrived when shunted to the right side of midfield. A better option will be Toulouse’s Mamady Bangré or Abdoul Tapsoba. Velud has played a fluid 4-4-2 that morphs into a 4-3-3 to good effect, keeping the direct, counter-attacking style Burkina Faso are known for. Hervé Koffi remains the preferred goalkeeper, while Edmond Tabsoba and captain Issoufou Dayo will be at centre-back. Abdoul Guiébré is usually at left-back and Luton Town’s Issa Kaboré is expected to make a return from injury in time to feature at right-back. Bayer Leverkusen star Tabsoba is one of the best defenders in Europe at carrying the ball out from defence – no defender in the Bundesliga this season has averaged more ball carries (27.7) or more progressive ball carries (14.8) per 90 than he has. France-based Gustavo Sangaré has played well when partnered with Blati Touré, Ismahila Ouédraogo and Bertrand Traoré midfield. Rising star Dango Ouattara (Bournemouth) is a certain starter in most games. More than decent options on the bench include Tanzania-based Stephane Aziz Ki, an incredibly exciting prospect: a technically sound metronome capable of some wizardry in central midfield. Adamo Nagalo – who we picked as one of our AFCON players to watch – is being groomed to replace the slowing Dayo, whose lack of place is targeted by smart opponents. All in all, fans of the Stallions will likely aim to finish second in the group behind Algeria, after which the permutations could favour them towards another berth in the last eight. From there, it’s anyone’s game. Before anything, let’s wish Algeria, Burkina Faso and Angola good luck in their group games against Mauritania’s goalkeeper, Babacar Niasse. He’s 6-foot-5 and barely needs to stretch his arms to snatch balls from corners and free kicks. Teams will need to be clever against the 27-year-old Guingamp shot-stopper. Niasse is part of a team that continues to be one of the most fascinating stories in recent AFCON history. Only a decade ago, Mauritania were regularly forfeiting international football matches due to a lack of commitment or dearth in talent. The story, now, is starkly different, and the country now considers AFCON qualification something of a must-have. At the last AFCON, they included then 16-year-old midfielder Beyatt Lekweiry, which signaled their confidence in their emerging young players. He did not make it to Ivory Coast this year, but plenty of young talent will have their chances in this Les Mourabitounes team that is making a third successive tournament appearance. The mentality of this team is worth noting, having managed qualification despite being docked three points and three goals for fielding an ineligible player against DR Congo. They managed 10 points from six matches, two points behind group winners, DR Congo. Following the building of basic football infrastructure and other ancillary investments through the FIFA Forward programme, it should take about 10 years for Mauritania to produce a steady stream of homegrown talent. For now, the plan has been to get as many Senegalese-Mauritanians as possible into the national team. As many as 16 of the current squad were eligible to play for Senegal. Meanwhile, in coach Amir Abdou, they have found a man who specialises in punching above his weight. It was he who led Comoros to their first AFCON in 2021, where a famous victory against Ghana sent them to the last 16. That’s what he’s known for. Less mentioned is the fact that he was coaching Mauritania’s biggest club team, FC Nouadibhou, at the same time as coaching the Comoros national team. In charge since March 2022, Abdou aims to improve on the work of former Mauritanian coaches Didier Gomes and Corentin da Silva from the last two tournaments (one goal and no win in 2019, no goals and no win in 2021). Mauritania’s recent performances have burnished Abdou’s reputation as a no-nonsense, team-first approach kind of guy. There are several decent players, but the team is heavily reliant on the collective rather than individual brilliance. That said, three players can be called the stars of the team. One is Hemeya Tanjy, one of the most expensive transfers from the Mauritanian domestic scene after he was acquired for just over $1 million by Libyan side Ittihad Tripoli from FC Nouadibhou. He scored twice in qualifying. He usually partners another star player, former Fulham striker Aboubakar Kamara. The team’s top scorer in qualifying with three goals, he is the captain and the most technical player in the squad. A reliable source of goals, it was his strike that sealed qualification for AFCON 2021. Together with Tanjy, they scored more than 100 goals in the local league before going abroad. The third big name is the recently-emerged Aboubakary Koïta, who was top scorer in the Belgian top flight (until recently) with 11 goals. He famously admitted to opting for the land of his mother’s birth because “my father’s country [Senegal] was taking too long to notice me.” Look out for his dead ball abilities as well. Souleymane Anne, who was a teenage forward in the team’s 2019 AFCON debut, is now mature enough to play a more impactful role from the bench. TP Mazembe right-back Ibrahim Keita can also lay claim to being one of the best in Africa, and his offensive forays should be key. Entertaining football should not be expected from Les Mourabitounes, but a hardworking, all-running side should. Historically, the Pelancas Negras have huffed and puffed, but rarely brought the house down. Their status as the archetypal mid-level African team was underlined when coach Pedro Gonçalves described the team as “the weakest in [Group E].” To say this in a group that includes Mauritania gives an insight into the realities of the two-time quarter-finalists. It’s actually a minor miracle that they are making their return to the tournament considering the array of organisational problems besetting them in the last few years. Indeed, local media generally believe that finishing second in qualifying (with nine points) behind Ghana was only possible because Central African Republic (seven points) and Madagascar (three points) were not very good. A lot of credit must go to Gonçalves, who has huge respect in the country. The Portuguese started from Angolan club football a decade ago, where his Primeiro de Agosto side played delectable attacking football. His scouting eye convinced authorities to make him the Under-17 national team coach, and he rewarded them with a round of 16 berth at the 2019 U17 World Cup. Making the step up for the senior team has not been easy for Gonçalves, and his mix of youth and experienced players is not consistent. There has been a lot of experimentation as he has looked for a reliable core, and like many teams at recent AFCONs, Angola have also looked at diasporan players to shore up the talent pool. Several of the squad heading to the AFCON are also eligible to play for neighbouring DR Congo through family ties. A major setback was the withdrawal of Fiorentina attacker M’bala Nzola in December in what is thought to be a career decision. “He did not want to risk losing his place at the club,” says football analyst Jose Sardinha. Some have said that the 27-year-old checked out because he was not confident about the quality of preparation and facilities from the football federation. The team is in transition, and a noticeable area to improve is scoring. Since September, the team has managed just two goals in seven games (as of the time of publishing). Blessed with a number of flamboyant players, this team badly needs goals. They managed just six goals in six qualifying matches, which is why the decision not to call up locally based Gilberto (Petro Atlético) was baffling. A very direct attacking midfielder, he is not afraid to take on opponents and progresses the ball well. For those in the squad, the Ligue 1-based Jérémie Bela is favoured. He opted to play for Angola at 28 once he realised he was unlikely to get a place in the DR Congo team – and it’s not hard to see why. Bella shoots a lot but does not often score, in addition to being technically limited. Angola have gone with a back three in recent qualifiers. Based on those games, expect the excellent shot-stopper Neblú in goal, and the back three to consist of Jonathan Buatu, Núrio Fortuna and star defender Kialonda Gaspar. For full-backs, Tó Carneiro, a workaholic not afraid to bomb forward with good link-up play, will be on the left while Loide Augusto is on the right. The experienced duo of Fredy and Manuel Cafumana (known by all as ‘Show’) as well emerging star Manuel Keliano could be in midfield. Upfront is Gelson Dala, who dazzled for Angolan giants Primeiro de Agosto and was a target of several top African clubs after scoring 23 goals in 27 games – helping them win the Angolan top flight title in 2016. He signed for Sporting CP in Portugal, where he played just once in three years for the first team. After being bounced around on loan a few times, he has been in Qatar since 2021. There’s always a buzz whenever he’s on the ball, because he is exciting. He is likely to partner Cagliari’s 21-year-old Zito Luvumbo, named among the world’s best 60 young players of 2019 by The Guardian. Mabululu, with six goals in seven Egyptian Premier League games for Al Ittihad Alexandria in Egypt, is yet to translate that form for the national team and will likely come off the bench. This will be Angola’s ninth appearance in the African Cup of Nations, and they are expected to have another underwhelming tournament. Want more AFCON preview content?

The pair, on paper, are expected to be the top two but the Scorpions and Syli National are notorious and have other ideas as dark horses. Welcome to the group of death. After years of disappointment, Senegal finally ended their trophy drought by winning the 2021 AFCON at the expense of Egypt. Despite a slow start, the Lions of Teranga started to look like champions-elect in the latter stages of the competition. Senegal only scored once in the group stages and played out two goalless draws before qualifying for the knockout round. One of the goalless draws came against Guinea, who they will come up against once again in this year’s group stage. Throughout 2023, Aliou Cissé’s side just lost one game, with 2024 starting on a winning note after they beat Niger 1-0. Once again, Cissé can boast a glamorous squad led by Sadio Mané. The 47-year-old will be happy to have the services of Mané after having to do without him at the 2022 World Cup. Senegal still managed to go beyond the group stages without their star man, highlighting how deep the pool of talent is in the squad. Though there have been a few additions, it’s primarily still a similar squad from the last edition. The big worry for a lot of Senegalese is whether the team can maintain the same level of intensity and quality after most of their key players moved to the Gulf Region in the past year. Édouard Mendy (Al-Ahli), Kalidou Koulibaly (Al Hilal), Abdou Diallo (Al-Arabi), Sadio Mané (Al Nassr), and Habib Diallo (Al-Shabab) have all made the journey from Europe to the Gulf. Egypt remains the last country to defend their AFCON title, doing so in 2010 as the Pharaohs became the first side to win three consecutive AFCON trophies. It’s been 13 years and six tournaments since, and no country has managed to achieve that feat. Only three countries have ever managed to retain the AFCON title in the history of the competition; Egypt (1957, 1959; 2006, 2008, 2010), Ghana (1963, 1965), and Cameroon (2000, 2002). After defending their title in 2010, Egypt missed the next three tournaments from 2012 to 2015. Zambia, who won the 2012 edition, were eliminated in the group stages of the 2013 AFCON. Then Nigeria also failed to qualify for the 2015 AFCON after winning the trophy in 2013. 2015 champions Ivory Coast couldn’t go past the group stages in 2017. After defying the odds to win the 2017 AFCON, Cameroon were only good enough to make the round of 16 in the following tournament. Algeria deservedly won the 2019 AFCON and continued to dominate after. They went into the 2021 AFCON knowing avoiding defeat in three games would see them equal the record for the longest unbeaten run in world football (37 games held by Italy). But the north Africans lost to Equatorial Guinea and subsequently couldn’t make it out of the group. Clearly, recent defending AFCON champions have struggled. It’s either that teams have lost their X-factor after winning the title, or teams have just figured them out. Or maybe complacency has set in. The challenge has been set and Senegal know exactly what to expect in Ivory Coast. There’s been a 40% increase in the prize money since the Lions of Teranga won it, with the new winner set to take home £5.5 million. Will that be enough motivation for the 2021 winners? What a start to the year it’s been for Sadio Mané who opened the Bambali Stadium in his home town in Senegal and also got married to his long-time partner. Mané is one of the most decorated African players in the 21st century. He won everything with Liverpool including the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, and UEFA Super Cup. However, he is adamant that the AFCON trophy remains the best trophy he has won. The former Liverpool forward grew up seeing the disappointments of Senegalese teams that came so close to a maiden title but never won it. To be the main man while making history perhaps makes it extra special for Mané. He scored three goals and provided two assists in Cameroon and was named player of the tournament. Now 31 years old, Mané made a revelation to CAF Online that this will probably be his toughest AFCON. “We know it won’t be easy but we will be there to do our best and try to go through every round. We are expecting a tough competition. This competition will be one of the strongest since I started playing in it because all the big countries are here and they all have their targets, but we will see what will happen. “Firstly, winning the AFCON was the best trophy I have ever won in my life, and coming to do it again will be special and a big achievement. It’s been a dream to play in this competition since I was a kid and we will do our best,” he added. Nowadays, the Senegal captain plays in the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr where he has 12 goals and 6 assists in all competitions this season. Age isn’t on Mané’s side and with him no longer playing in as competitive a league as before, other players will have to take responsibility if Senegal are to retain their crown. The Chelsea forward is yet to score his first Senegal goal and has only been limited to 238 minutes since making his international debut in November 2022. At club level, only 12 players scored more non-penalty goals across the top five European leagues in 2023 than Jackson (17). Only six of those had a better minutes-per-goal ratio than he did (133 mins per goal). One of Jackson’s strengths at a young age is his ability to find space and take up good goal-scoring positions. Of all players to play 600+ mins of Premier League football this season, he’s got the fourth-best non-penalty xG per 90 rate. He could be one of the attacking options who can help ease the goal-scoring burden on Mané in Ivory Coast. In the last AFCON, Senegal banked their hopes on an injured Sarr and still included him in the squad. Upon his return, he scored in the quarter-finals and provided an assist in the semi-finals. He brought a spark to the Senegalese team – something they lacked in the group stages. This time he’s fit and has been on decent form for his new side Marseille. His six goal contributions (4 goals, 2 assists) are the fifth-highest by a Marseille player in all competitions this season. Boulaye Dia has been one of the revelations in Serie A in the last couple of years. None of the 18 players to have scored 12+ Serie A goals since the start of last season have a shot conversion rate as good as Dia (27.0%), while only four players have scored more goals in the competition since then. The Salernitana forward has scored 20 goals in Serie A since the 2022-23 season. Also, only Lautaro Martínez (+8.7) has outperformed his xG total in Serie A by more than Dia (+7.6) since the start of last season. Abdallah Sima has been the talk of the Scottish Premiership this season scoring 10 goals and providing three assists, playing predominantly as a right winger. The 22-year-old is on loan at Rangers from Brighton and has shown he can also play anywhere across the front three. He’s viewed as one for the future with just four caps for Senegal but don’t be surprised to see Cissé call on him when the going gets tough. In midfield, Lamine Camara may be tasked with some of the creative burden – which shouldn’t be too much of an ask from the Metz midfielder. He’s the leading chance creator for Metz in all competitions this season (22) and Cissé will hope he can replicate similar numbers this AFCON. Cameroon are one\\xa0of the three countries to ever defend their AFCON title. They achieved that feat by beating Senegal on penalties in 2002. Only Egypt has more AFCON titles than Cameroon’s five. The last title for the Indomitable Lions came in 2017 when the rest of the continent least expected it. Before a ball was kicked in Gabon, no one gave Cameroon a chance. Preparations for that tournament were far from ideal and to make matters worse, many players, including Joël Matip and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting rejected the call-up. Against all odds, Hugo Broos won Cameroon’s fifth AFCON with a relatively inexperienced and unknown squad. It wouldn’t be the last time Cameroon were involved in some form of drama for a major tournament. Following the early termination of his contract, Toni Conceicao was awarded £1.28 million in compensation by the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot). The Portuguese coach led Cameroon to a third-place AFCON finish on home soil two years ago but was relieved of his duties weeks later. He then took his former employers to the world football governing body, FIFA. Conceicao was dramatically replaced by Rigobert Song\\xa0after the president of Cameroon Paul Biya asked the Federation to do so. Conceicao had helped Cameroon reach the play-off stages of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, with Song subsequently crossing the line after beating Algeria on away goals. Conceicao joined Winfried Schafer, who led Cameroon to AFCON success in 2002, Artur Jorge, and Denis Lavagne as coaches to have had money problems with the five-time African champions. Just one month after the 2022 World Cup, André Onana retired from the national team after he was sent home during the tournament for a dispute with Song. The latest controversy is Choupo-Moting being dropped from Cameroon’s final squad for the 2023 AFCON. Reports in Cameroon suggest that the technical team and the Bayern Munich forward are not on good terms. It is believed Choupo-Moting’s habit of skipping international matches, especially friendlies, didn’t go down too well with the staff. The 34-year-old, who has 73 caps for Cameroon, missed the friendlies against Russia and Senegal in October and as a result, has been dropped from the squad. European clubs were ordered by FIFA to release African players for the AFCON by 3 January. However, Manchester United and Cameroon have been in negotiations that have led to André Onana being allowed to feature in the game against Tottenham Hotspur on 14 January, which is 24 hours before the Indomitable Lions face Guinea. Reports suggest he will miss the opening game as a result. With Onana also missing the Zambia friendly and arriving so late to the camp, it leaves Song in a handicapped position as he may be without one of his key players for their crucial first group game. According to Opta’s expected goals on target model, Onana has prevented 3.8 goals in the Premier League season – the fourth highest in the competition. His save percentage of 71.9% is the third-highest by any goalkeeper in the Premier League this season. In Onana’s absence, Fabrice Ondoa has deputised and with the Man Utd man arriving so late, Song could be forced to stick with Ondoa for at least the first game. A glance at the top goalscorers chart from the 2021 AFCON shows just how dominant Cameroon were going forward. Vincent Aboubakar finished as top scorer with eight goals, while Karl Toko Ekambi was second in the race with five goals. In scoring eight goals at AFCON 2021, Aboubakar equalled Laurent Pokou’s tally at the 1970 edition with Ivory Coast but fell one short of the all-time tournament record held by Zaire’s Ndaye Mulamba in 1974 (9). The pair were scoring goals for fun but couldn’t lead their country to glory on home soil. Third place was a decent finish but the central African country will want to build on that this time around. In the absence of Choupo-Moting and Bryan Mbuemo (injury), Song will need these two to recreate their magic from the last edition. Kaba Diawara may be a name that sounds familiar to Arsenal fans of the older generation. The French-born former Guinea international joined the Gunners in 1999 and is described as one of the unluckiest strikers in the Premier League. In a must-win game for Arsenal at Elland Road, Arsène Wenger subbed Diawara on. He had a goal-bound effort cleared off the line and another shot seconds later hit the crossbar. That was the story of Diawara’s life in the Premier League. He failed to register a goal for Arsenal, and one fan admitted: “Never have I seen one player hit the woodwork as many times in half a season as Diawara did in 1999. Everyone willed him on, but somehow the ball kept hitting the post.” A quarter of a century years later, Diawara will be in the dugout for Guinea as he hopes to lead them to their first AFCON title. He will be hoping for more luck this time after his side were knocked out in the round of 16 by The Gambia in the previous edition of the tournament. Serhou Guirassy would probably not believe it if anyone told him 11 years ago that he would challenge Harry Kane for the Bundesliga Golden Boot. Back then, he had just failed his trials at Auxerre, but that didn’t stop the striker who has now become a sensation in Germany. Guirassy began the 2023-24 campaign on fire, becoming the first player to score eight goals from eight shots on target in his first four top-flight games of the season for VfB Stuttgart. By matchday five, the 27-year-old had surpassed Robert Lewandowski’s record of having the highest-ever Bundesliga goals haul at such an early season stage. Slight injuries might have slowed the Guinean down a bit but he still has 19 goals in all competitions this season for Die Roten. Unfortunately, Guirassy went off injured in the final pre-tournament friendly against Nigeria after just 26 minutes. The striker, who made his international debut in March 2022, has three goals so far for the Syli National. In his absence, Mohammed Bayo will most likely step up to replace him. The 25-year-old has four Ligue 1 goals for Le Havre this season and also played every game at the 2021 AFCON. Since making his international debut in May 2014, Naby Keïta hasn’t seen much success for the Syli National. The former Liverpool midfielder has over 50 caps and 11 goals for Guinea, but as a collective, Guinea’s performances at major tournaments have been abysmal. In 2015 and 2017, they were knocked out at the group stages of the AFCON and only made the round of 16 stage in 2019 and 2021. For the quality Guinea possess, one would expect them to be reaching the last eight of the competition like they used to do in the early 2000s. Now captain, Keïta has the responsibility of leading the Syli National back to where they previously belonged. The Gambia are back again – the team that made every neutral smile. In the previous AFCON, they came to the competition as the lowest-ranked side (150th)\\xa0and the lowest-ranked team to have ever competed in the tournament. They beat Mauritania and Tunisia and drew with Mali to progress from the group on what was their first attempt. In the round of 16, The Gambia kept up their momentum and narrowly beat Guinea, a team they’ve once again been paired with. Despite holding hosts Cameroon to a goalless first half, The Gambia were eliminated in the quarter-final, losing 2-0. Just like two years ago, the Scorpions return with an underdog tag but all other teams in this group will be wary of them nonethless. They needed two goals in the last 10 minutes in their final qualifier against Congo to qualify, and they managed them in dramatic style, with the equaliser coming in the 90th minute. The Gambia tend to believe nowadays, and that’s their biggest asset. Before the appointment of Tom Sanfiet in 2018, The Gambia hadn’t won a qualifier in five years. They were ranked 172nd in the world and Sanfiet had a dream of qualifying for a maiden tournament. The Belgian travelled around Europe, at his own expense, speaking to players of dual nationality to convince them to play for The Gambia. As a result, six members of their 2021 AFCON squad had Italian roots. Sanfiet, who has managed 10 different national teams, has made the team believe again, and with consistent success they’ll only aspire to reach higher heights. On paper, the 50-year-old likes to set his team up in a 4-3-3 that moves into a 4-5-1 without the ball. The Gambia are tough to break down and are defensively disciplined, knowing their clinical attackers have what it takes to convert their limited chances. This approach may be seen as negative but it has served Sanfiet and The Gambia well so far. Key players such as Assan Ceesay, Musa Barrow, Ablie Jallow, and Ebrima Colley will be crucial for Sanfiet if they are to replicate their heroics from the last edition. The Gambia were 2-0 down away from home in the last round of qualifiers for this AFCON. With 10 minutes to go, second-half substitute, Yankuba Minteh pulled one goal back on his international debut. The Gambia’s presence in Ivory Coast is at least in part because of the 19-year-old. Despite making just one appearance for the Scorpions, the teenager has everything in his toolbox to become one of the wildcards for Sanfiet at this tournament. He has been impressive in the Dutch Eredivisie on loan at Feyenoord from Newcastle United, with three goals and one assist in 12 games, and he also has a goal in the Champions League this season. Yankuba Minteh is a player to watch at AFCON 2023. Want more AFCON preview content?

We look ahead to Group B at AFCON 2023 with our group stage preview. There was a time when the AFCON title was almost a birthright for Egypt. Before a ball was kicked, nearly everyone agreed it was Egypt’s title to lose. The gold-plated trophy stayed in Cairo for four years between 2006 and 2010 after the Pharaohs won the tournament for an unprecedented three successive titles.\\xa0 Despite not winning the AFCON in 13 years now, Egypt’s record of having the most AFCON titles (seven) will remain intact as they have two more than the next country on the list (Cameroon). Egypt, given their mentality, will be looking ahead and challenging themselves to get a record-extending eighth crown.\\xa0 Since their last triumph on the continent, the North African country has gone through a rebuilding phase, with young talents growing to become core members of the side. The Pharaohs will head to Ivory Coast with the oldest squad at this AFCON with an average age of 28.9 years, highlighting how the core of Mohamed Elneny (31), Mohamed Salah (31), Trezeguet (29), Hamdi Fathy (29) and Ahmed Hegazi (32) are approaching the twilight of their respective careers.\\xa0 Portuguese coach Rui Vitória is the man tasked with bringing the AFCON back to Egypt. He’s won the Portuguese Primeira Liga twice with Benfica and won the Saudi Pro League once. His Egypt side seems to have switched from the cautious style under Carlos Queiroz to a more expansive approach, which has seen them score 33 goals in 14 games.\\xa0\\xa0 In the previous AFCON, Egypt scored four goals in seven games. Of those four goals, Salah contributed to three (two goals and one assist). This is, quite simply, his team.\\xa0 He played in four of the 2023 AFCON qualifiers and once again showed his worth, scoring two and assisting three. But for all his 55 goals for Egypt, Salah is yet to win a trophy with them; it’s arguably holding him back from being regarded as Egypt’s greatest ever player, even if on talent alone there’s no question.\\xa0 “I want to win it! I love playing for my country,” Salah said after his final game for Liverpool before he joined Egypt’s camp.\\xa0 The 31-year-old has lost two finals; in 2017 to Cameroon and in 2021 AFCON (which was played in early 2022) to Senegal. Time is running out, though there’s reason to believe he’s in the best condition to help his country claw back lost glory.\\xa0 Halfway through the season, Salah already has 18 goals in all competitions in what is shaping up to be one of his best campaigns at Liverpool. He’s scoring 0.72 goals per 90, with no player scoring more than him in the Premier League in 2023-24 prior to him heading to Ivory Coast. His 0.72 goals per 90 is also better than four of the seven seasons he’s spent in England.\\xa0 His form this season has seen him climb into the Premier League’s top 10 all-time leading goalscorers, becoming the fifth-fastest player (247 games) to reach the 150-goal landmark in the competition behind only Alan Shearer (212), Sergio Agüero (217), Harry Kane (218) and Thierry Henry (220).\\xa0 Over the next month, Salah will be aiming to become the first Egyptian player to score at four different AFCON tournaments – he previously netted at the 2017, 2019, and 2021 editions.\\xa0\\xa0 Omar Marmoush had the option of representing Canada after his parents worked there for six years and acquired Canadian passports. However, the 24-year-old chose to play for the country of his birth and made his debut back in October 2021, scoring the only goal against Libya in a World Cup qualifier.\\xa0 He’s been one of the revelations of the 2023-24 Bundesliga season, scoring six goals in his first 10 games for his new side Eintracht Frankfurt. One of the highlights was him stealing the show against reigning league champions Bayern Munich, scoring a goal and providing two assists in a 5-1 win.\\xa0 Across all competitions, only four Bundesliga players have scored more goals than Marmoush this season (12), which is already his highest-scoring campaign. With the ability to play across the front three, Marmoush will be one to watch for the record AFCON winners.\\xa0\\u202f\\xa0 Mostafa Mohamed is yet to score an AFCON goal in seven appearances, a streak the Egyptian faithful will hope comes to an end in Ivory Coast.\\u202f\\xa0 The striker’s form suggests he could break that duck soon as he has been the top scorer for Nantes in Ligue 1 since the start of last season, with 14 goals in 2,977 minutes.\\xa0 The striker is strong in the air and will be critical at set-pieces for Egypt. Only three Ligue 1 forwards have won more aerial duels since the start of 2022-23 than Mohamed (109), who also ranks third for headed goals (5) and fifth for headed shots (25).\\xa0 One of the major prerequisites for performing well in major tournaments is having a reliable goalkeeper. When you have two and one specialises in saving penalties, your chances of going deep skyrocket. This is one reason why Egypt always themselves among the favourites of the tournament.\\xa0 One of the key components of Egypt’s ‘golden generation’ was Essam El-Hadary – one of Africa’s finest ever goalkeepers. Under his guidance as Egypt’s goalkeeper coach, Mohamed Abou Gabal – more commonly known as Gabaski – and Mohamed El Shenawy were the best in this department during the 2021 AFCON.\\xa0 Gabal and El Shenawy, based on Opta’s expected goals on target model, prevented 3.83 and 3.29 goals – the two highest in the tournament – respectively.\\xa0 El Shenawy was having an all-timer tournament before he sustained an injury in the round of 16 against Ivory Coast, with Gabal replacing him in the 88th minute. Gabal went on to be the hero in two penalty shootouts and even saved Sadio Mané’s first-half spot-kick in the final.\\xa0 With both goalkeepers once again included in Egypt’s squad, we can expect to see a similar level of healthy competition among the pair.\\xa0 The last AFCON was statistically Ghana’s worst performance at a major tournament. One draw from three games saw the Black Stars eliminated in the group stage.\\xa0 For a team that made the semi-finals at least in every edition between 2008 and 2017, one slip-up would have been forgivable, but the warning signs suggested a dip had been coming. In the 2019 edition, Ghana scraped through the group, winning just one game. In the round of 16, the Black Stars lost on penalties to Tunisia.\\xa0 The decline has been quite rapid and failure to go deep in Ivory Coast will see Ghana, a team ranked 11th in Africa, confirm their status outside the continent’s elite football countries.\\xa0 Chris Hughton was appointed less than a year ago to help remedy the fall of Ghana football. The former Brighton coach has struggled to string good results together, with a win rate of 40%.\\xa0 Goals have been hard to come by under Hughton. Eight in 10 games, stodgy football and a porous defence are what Ghanaians have grown used to when it comes to the national team.\\xa0 As a result, expectations are very low heading into the tournament.\\xa0 The Ghana Football Association initially announced the Black Stars would be basing themselves in Johannesburg, South Africa for the 2023 AFCON. The announcement was met with extreme public outrage, outlining the difference in climate conditions between South Africa and host nation Ivory Coast. The average temperature in Johannesburg is around 15-17°C colder than that of Abidjan; it was a no-brainer to base themselves in West Africa to help acclimatise to similar conditions.\\xa0 Ultimately, the decision was reversed as the players converged on Kumasi, Ghana. It is only the second time in the last 22 years the Black Stars have based themselves in their own country ahead of the AFCON.\\xa0 AFCONs in January always come with their complications. The tournament’s timing has once again fuelled inter-continental conflict as African federations battle European clubs for their players.\\xa0 CAF reached a touch-and-go agreement with European clubs for AFCON 2021 to release players as late as 3 January, although most clubs usually want to hold onto key players for longer to the detriment of African countries.\\u202f\\xa0 Athletic Bilbao delayed Iñaki Williams’ journey to Ghana’s camp because of illness and insisted he needed rest. It was a similar situation with Mohammed Kudus, with West Ham adamant he was injured, thus delaying his arrival in Kumasi.\\xa0 Hughton will at least expect to call on the services of these players. However, Thomas Partey, Tariq Lamptey, Kofi Kyereh, Kamaldeen Sulemana and Joseph Aidoo all miss the tournament due to injury.\\xa0 Baba Rahman and Fatawu Issahaku both opted out of the final squad for personal reasons, leaving Hughton short-changed.\\xa0 On a personal level, André Ayew could write his name in the AFCON history books even before the conclusion of the group stages in Ivory Coast.\\xa0 This will be his eighth AFCON tournament – something only Rigobert Song (Cameroon) and Ahmed Hassan (Egypt) have previously managed.\\u202f\\xa0 The 34-year-old is also two games away from playing the most AFCON games. He is Ghana’s highest scorer in the AFCON with 10 goals as well, meaning any he scores in Ivory Coast will extend his record.\\xa0 Ayew has scored in six of the previous seven tournaments – if he nets at AFCON 2023, he’ll set a new record and overtake Samuel Eto’o, Kalusha Bwalya and Asamoah Gyan for the most tournaments scored in.\\xa0 Immortality awaits.\\xa0 There is a school of thought that if Kudus played in Cameroon two years ago, Ghana would have done better. There is no better way for the 23-year-old to back this theory than by playing a key role for the Black Stars this time around.\\xa0 A little over a year ago, the former Ajax player showed the world what he’s capable of in Qatar, becoming the first Ghanaian to score two goals in a World Cup game.\\xa0 Kudus has since been a revelation for West Ham this term and is the club’s second top scorer in all competitions with 10 goals, behind only Jarrod Bowen (14), while just 10 players have better non-penalty goals per 90 rates in the Premier League this season than his 0.56 (min. 3 goals).\\xa0\\xa0 He’s chipped in creatively as well, with Lucas Paquetá (37) the one West Ham player to create more chances in open play across all competitions than his 18 prior to the weekend draw with Bristol City.\\xa0 Kudus’ work rate will also be a huge miss to West Ham while he’s away, as his 8.6 possession regains per 90 minutes is the best of all players in the Premier League in 2023-24 (minimum 300 minutes played).\\xa0 Everything suggests that, if fit, Kudus will make his presence felt in the AFCON.\\xa0 The goalkeeping position is usually the most stable in football. But that hasn’t been the case for Ghana since Hughton took over. Lawrence Ati-Zigi was in goal for the first four matches, Manaf Nurudeen stepped in for a couple of friendlies, then Richard Ofori made a return to the XI and has been number one for the past two games.\\xa0 It is one of the crucial questions Hughton and his technical team need to answer before the tournament. Nurudeen didn’t make the AFCON squad and was replaced by Jojo Wollacott, who missed the 2022 World Cup due to injury.\\xa0 The Islanders will be participating in a second successive AFCON, having only ever managed such a feat once before. The rise of Cape Verdean football is a remarkable one. As recently as 15 years ago, Cape Verde was never discussed seriously when it came to African football. After Portuguese coach João de Deus – who has since become the right-hand man of the renowned Jorge Jesus – brought numerous players from European leagues into the national team setup in 2009, it was a game-changer for the once-minnows.\\u202f\\xa0 The majority of the players on the national team were expatriate Cape Verdeans, who outnumbered those who resided on the islands. Most of the current generation of Cape Verde international footballers are based abroad, generally in Europe but also in Asia; some were not even born in the nation.\\xa0 On their first ever AFCON appearance, they were placed in pot four but ended up as the highest-ranking country (51st) in Group A alongside Morocco (71st), South Africa (72nd) and Angola (83rd). Confidence was high as they progressed to the last eight after drawing with South Africa and Morocco before beating Angola.\\xa0 In the quarter-finals they outshot Ghana and were unlucky to be knocked out after a spirited performance. Fatau Dauda, the Black Stars goalkeeper, was man of the match after making several spectacular saves. Eleven years down the line, the two teams will meet once again, this time in the first group game. Following the 2013 edition of the AFCON, Cape Verde broke into the top 30 of the FIFA rankings for the very first time. Three consecutive draws were not enough to propel them out of the group in 2015, though. Unfortunately, they were eliminated on goal difference and went off the boil as their FIFA ranking plummeted.\\xa0 However, the Islanders returned to the big time two years ago and reminded the continent of how good they can be when holding hosts Cameroon to a 1-1 draw and beating Ethiopia to qualify for the round of 16. They were knocked out by eventual champions Senegal.\\xa0 Ryan Mendes remains one of the few native Cape Verdeans in the squad and he is undoubtedly the most experienced. He’s the country’s most-capped player with 67 and made his debut in 2010 at age 20.\\xa0 His 15 goals are also the most scored for the Cape Verde national team and by default he becomes a player to watch for the Blue Sharks at this AFCON.\\xa0 The 34-year-old has three AFCONs under his belt and captains Cape Verde these days. Now playing in the Turkish Süper Lig for Fatih Karagümrük, the left winger has two goals and an assist in his 13 appearances this season.\\xa0 When the Mambas qualified for the AFCON in 1986, they had to wait 10 years before making a return. Progress was made as they qualified for back-to-back tournaments in 1996 and 1998 but they subsequently had to endure a 12-year wait to play in the continental showpiece again.\\xa0 Mozambicans have once again had to wait for 13 years to be in Ivory Coast for the AFCON. It’s a privilege the people of Mozambique don’t take lightly because no one knows when they’ll be back again.\\xa0 Despite making four AFCON appearances, Mozambique are yet to register a win, and that will be the target heading into this tournament. Chiquinho Conde’s team barely had any expectations at home because qualifying for the finals ahead of Benin and Rwanda threw the country into a state of ecstasy and can be seen as an achievement itself.\\xa0 Now imagine the scenes if Mozambique earn their first AFCON win; after all, they are among the least-fancied teams in the tournament. Atlético Madrid defender, Reinildo, is still recovering from an injury and it’s unclear whether he will be fit enough for the tournament. He is one of their key players and has 33 caps for the national team since making his debut in 2014.\\xa0 Outside of Mozambique, he is referred to as Elias Pelembe. In his home country, they call him Domingues. He’s 40 years old and likely to be the oldest player to feature at the 2023 AFCON.\\xa0 When the Mambas last competed in the AFCON in 2010, Domingues played in each of their games. He is the country’s most-capped player with 106 appearances to his name and the highest scorer (16) among players who are still active.\\xa0 He started his career with Desportivo Maputo in Mozambique and travelled to South Africa where he played for five clubs including Supersport United and Mamelodi Sundowns. Nowadays he’s back home and representing UD Songo.\\u202f\\xa0 Domingues hasn’t scored for the national team since 2016 and will be keen to change that in Ivory Coast.\\xa0 Want more AFCON preview content?

Hosts Ivory Coast will look to impress but come up against a scary Nigerian attack, while Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau aren’t there to make up the numbers.\\xa0 After winning their maiden Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title in 1992, the Ivorians had to wait 23 years to experience that euphoric triumph again, beating Ghana in the 2015 final. As the Elephants aim to go all the way this time on home soil, they’ll hope it’s less nail-biting considering their two previous successes came via penalty shootouts. Since winning the AFCON nine years ago, Ivory Coast have barely advanced in the subsequent tournaments, only reaching the quarter-finals once. The last edition was underwhelming again, faltering at the round of 16 and losing on penalties to eventual finalists Egypt. Just as everyone has grown accustomed to, Ivory Coast always name one of the most star-studded squads for the AFCON and this year is no different. The challenge has always been whether their vast array of individual talent can work well together. The moment you arrive in Ivory Coast you’re greeted with various ‘Akwaba’ inscriptions bidding you welcome in Ivorian parlance. AFCON fever has been in the air since October, when the country hosted the draw for the tournament. Billboards, mascots and AFCON decorations dominate the streets of Abidjan. Despite the excitement that a major tournament is returning to Ivory Coast after 40 years, expectations are measured. The last time the West African country hosted an AFCON, they were eliminated in the group stages. Anything similar this time and will be deemed extreme failure. The overarching belief is that this is a fairly young and inexperienced squad that can achieve greater things if given time. Though, the consensus is for the team to still try and go deep in the competition given they are hosting. History isn’t really on the side of the two-time AFCON champions, with host countries finding it extremely difficult to win the tournament, especially in recent years. Since 1982, the host countries have won just five of the 19 AFCON editions, with none of the nine hosts across the last eight tournaments doing so. Egypt were the last hosts to lift the AFCON trophy on home soil, back in 2006. Hosting the AFCON has never been a guarantee for success with four of the last eight hosts eliminated at the quarter-final stage. So Ivory Coast, beware. In 2016, Wilfried Zaha switched his international allegiance to Ivory Coast despite playing for England’s youth teams and also featuring in a couple of non-competitive games for the Three Lions. Ivorians were excited because they had at their disposal one of the most petrifying wingers in the Premier League. Fast forward eight years and Zaha’s journey with the Elephants has been underwhelming, to say the least. The Galatasaray winger has only 31 caps and hasn’t made the squad for 42 games due to injury or reasons not stated. The peak of it all is that Zaha won’t be at the 2023 AFCON after he wasn’t included in Jean-Louis Gasset’s final squad. His exclusion can be narrowed down to underperformance and constant criticism of the federation for not doing enough. Luckily, Gasset still has an abundance of attacking talent he can rely on. Haller has been the go-to guy in attack for Ivory Coast over the past few months. He made his AFCON debut in the last edition and scored one goal in the four games he played in Cameroon. He’s since had to battle testicular cancer and therefore missed a chunk of games for the Elephants, but the Borussia Dortmund forward scored on his return to international football in an AFCON qualifier against Comoros. During the October international break, the 29-year-old demonstrated how crucial he can be by scoring in both friendlies against Morocco and South Africa. Although he is yet to get off the mark in the Bundesliga this season despite appearing 11 times, Gasset will count on Haller to rediscover his goal-scoring form over the next month. When Konaté was just 17, he was scoring for fun as he led ASEC Mimosas to the domestic league title. The teenager was rewarded with a place in Ivory Coast’s squad for the 2021 AFCON (which was played in early 2022) — albeit he didn’t play a single minute in Cameroon. It was discernible that Konaté was Haller’s understudy in the national team. The 19-year-old’s integration has been step-by-step to ensure he remains grounded. So far he has 11 caps for the national team and scored two while assisting two in his first start, a friendly against Seychelles. In their pre-tournament friendly against Sierra Leone, Konaté grabbed an assist just 20 minutes after being subbed on. In Austria, the striker remains in the news, scoring eight goals in the Austrian Bundesliga this season. He has blistering pace and can run down the channels to create opportunities for teammates. Two assists and 15 chances created is a testament that he’s beyond just putting the ball in the back of the net. Unlike in AFCON 2021, Konaté will get minutes. Boga, who played for France’s Under-19s, made his debut for Ivory Coast in 2017 but had to wait until 2021 to return to the national team picture. In the last AFCON, he was limited to just 48 minutes of action and he’ll be hoping for more as they play in front of a home crowd. The OGC Nice winger was on the scoresheet during the Elephants’ 5-1 AFCON warm-up win against Sierra Leone on 6 January. Just like Zaha, Boga’s biggest strength is the ability to go past defenders with ease. Among Ligue 1 players who have played 900+ minutes this season, Boga ranks fourth for progressive carry distance per 90 (135.9) and fifth in progressive carries per 90 (11.8). Gradel doesn’t have the burst of pace that Boga possesses. But what he doesn’t have in legs, he makes up with his experience. The 36-year-old, who has amassed over 100 caps for the Elephants, will be playing in his seventh AFCON. Despite playing every AFCON qualifier, the Gaziantep winger has been limited to just 46 minutes in the last five games for Ivory Coast. In the last two friendlies against Seychelles and the Gambia, Gradel was an unused substitute, perhaps a hint of his role going into the continental showpiece. Gradel has created 23 chances, provided three assists, and scored four goals across six previous AFCON tournaments. That’s not too bad for an option from the bench. Ivory Coast conceded just three goals in four games during the 2021 AFCON. However, a closer look at the underlying numbers suggests their defence wasn’t as good as it seemed. The Elephants conceded an expected goals (xG) average of 1.23 per 90 minutes — above any of the other nations considered as realistic tournament contenders and more than double that conceded by both Nigeria (0.57) and Senegal (0.60). On another day, if their opponents took their chances, it could have been a lot worse for Ivory Coast. Odilon Kossounou, Simon Deli and Eric Bailly were the primary centre-back options for Patrice Beaumelle during the tournament in Cameroon. Interestingly, Kossounou is the only one to have kept his place in this year’s squad for the AFCON. In recent times, Evan Ndicka, Willy-Arnaud Boly and Ousmane Diomande have alternated in central defence. Diomande, who is just 20, has been impressive for Sporting CP and is being linked with many top European clubs. He is one of the best ball-carrying defenders in Portugal this season and ranks in the top four for total carries, carry distance, progressive carries and progressive carry distance among all defenders in the competition. If there’s one country that can’t wait for the 2023 AFCON to start, it has to be Nigeria. The past two years have been torrid for the Super Eagles after their round of 16 exit in the 2021 AFCON and failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Even though Nigeria have won the AFCON three times and medalled 15 times, there is a sense of underachievement because Nigerians typically always want more. In 2013, when Nigeria were crowned champions, no one saw it coming. The problem is with the amount of talent they boast these days, everyone has an eye out for them, making an already arduous task even tougher. In case there were any doubts concerning expectations, the official Super Eagles 2023 AFCON theme song has “Let’s do it again” being repeated in the hook. José Peseiro will face similar challenges to Gernot Rohr and Augustine Eguavoen; when you’re the coach of Nigeria, you simply have to win the AFCON. He says his side will fight to win the trophy in Ivory Coast but do Nigerians believe in him? Not really. Peseiro ticks several boxes. He’s very experienced, having worked in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. He has a master’s degree in sports science. He’s worked with the likes of José Mourinho and Carlos Queiroz, and worked at Real Madrid as an assistant. But none of that matters when you don’t win, especially when you’re head coach of Nigeria. The Portuguese manager has been in charge of the Super Eagles for 14 games and only won six, while losing five. While the qualification process for this AFCON edition was smooth, there’s overall concern about the balance of the team — the majority of Nigerians feel it makes them susceptible to counterattacks. Peseiro’s favoured 4-2-4 formation sees him play four attackers at a time, a system that has worked against inferior opponents like in their 10-0 win over São Tomé and Príncipe in qualification. However, in the recent World Cup qualifiers, Nigeria dropped points against Lesotho and Zimbabwe, conceding in both games. They also lost a pre-tournament friendly against Guinea 2-0 on 8 January. When there are so many in-form attackers in a squad, they must play and that’s what Peseiro is trying to do. If you were to name your ideal type of striker, there is a high likelihood that your answer will be found in Nigeria’s squad. Is it a target man? A striker that runs behind? A striker that can drop deep and play as a playmaker? Nigeria have it all. Like the last AFCON, the build-up has been largely dominated by the strength in depth Nigeria have in attack. The Super Eagles were unlucky in Cameroon as Victor Osimhen (injury + COVID), Emmanuel Dennis (administrative error), Paul Onuachu (injury) and Odion Ighalo (club issues) all missed the tournament. This time, they’ve been dealt the big blow of losing Victor Boniface to injury on the eve of the tournament, with the Bayer Leverkusen star leaving the squad on 8 January. Taiwo Awoniyi, the man who stepped up to replace Osimhen in the previous tournament, also misses out through injury. The usual suspects of Osimhen, Ademola Lookman, Ahmed Musa, Sadiq Umar and Samuel Chukwueze will all be present, while Terem Moffi — who has scored six goals in 16 Ligue 1 games for Nice this season — was the late replacement for Boniface. Onuachu, Cyril Dessers and Leverkusen’s Nathan Tella all failed to make the cut. It comes as no surprise that the Super Eagles scored the most goals in the qualifiers. The headache for Peseiro is who to start with, as in the past few months he has constantly rotated the squad. The temptation to use as many attackers as possible has also seen his team concede in 11 of the 14 games he’s been in charge. The majority of the goals conceded by first-choice goalkeeper Francis Uzoho have been avoidable. The problem with Nigeria’s goalkeeping department stems from the retirement of Vincent Enyeama back in 2015. The Super Eagles have just not managed to replace the man who won over 100 caps for the national team. Maduka Okoye, who was the goalkeeper in the last AFCON, was axed from the team after his error saw Tunisia eliminate the three-time winners. Uzoho has been between the posts for 13 of the 14 matches Peseiro has overseen. Adebayo Adeleye, the only other goalkeeper to get a chance, didn’t make the squad. Alongside Uzoho, the selection includes Olorunleke Ojo and Stanley Nwabili — they have one Nigeria cap between them. Uzoho will likely retain his place in goal, but Nigerians don’t have confidence in him, especially after his mistake cost them a place at the 2022 World Cup. If you have a goalkeeper you don’t trust, your only hope is to outscore all opponents to win games. Osimhen and Boniface are Nigeria’s most in-form players at the present time. A lot of the goalscoring burden in Ivory Coast was expected be on the shoulders of these two forwards. However, following a groin injury, Boniface has been ruled out of AFCON 2023 late in the day and replaced by Nice forward Moffi.  While Moffi is by no means a poor replacement, Boniface has settled quickly in Germany after making the switch to Bayer Leverkusen last summer. His 10 goals see him ranked as the fourth top scorer in the league as his side sits top of the league ahead of Bayern Munich. Across all competitions in 2023-24, only Harry Kane (25) and Serhou Guirassy (19) have scored more goals for a Bundesliga club this season than he has (16) at Leverkusen. Following his removal from the squad, Napoli striker Osimhen will be expected to lead the attack and provide the goals. He is on a mission, especially after missing the last edition of the AFCON. At the time of writing, since the last AFCON ended, only four players have scored more goals within the top five European leagues than his tally of 42. He hasn’t been as prolific in Serie A this season, as reigning champions Napoli have struggled to replicate last term’s form, but the 25-year-old has still scored seven goals — the joint-fourth highest in the league. He showed his qualities in the AFCON qualification campaign, with his 10 goals double that of any other player, although seven of those came in the two routs of São Tomé and Príncipe. The Nzalang Nacional may have only qualified for their fourth AFCON ever, but underestimate them at your peril. The only Spanish-speaking country on the continent has made it out of the group stages on every occasion they’ve qualified, reaching the quarter-finals twice and the semis once. In the previous edition, they ended Algeria’s 35-game unbeaten run while also beating Mali in the round of 16. They gave Senegal a run for their money in the last eight before eventually succumbing. Once again they’re in a difficult group but they’re not here just to participate. Don’t be shocked to see them upset the top two favourites. In September 2020, Juan Micha was reappointed as Equatorial Guinea Under-17s coach. However, when the senior national team was about to play their next match without a head coach, the federation asked Micha to partner with Casto Nopo for the upcoming games. They beat Libya twice and Micha was asked to stay. He eventually signed a contract months later and qualified for the 2021 AFCON. Talk about being in the right place at the right time. Overall, 2023 was an incredible year for Micha and Equatorial Guinea. They went the entire calendar year unbeaten, scoring nine goals and conceding just three across their seven games. They’re disciplined, effective and motivated under Micha, whose animated nature on the sidelines energises the team. Equatorial Guinea are a tough side to beat and can once again be the surprise package of the AFCON. When the African wild dog is hunting, it’s very patient in its approach. It’s a diurnal hunter and uses stamina to its advantage by wearing down the prey before they attack. These wild dogs are called the Djurtus, which is also the nickname of Guinea-Bissau. The people of Guinea-Bissau, like the African wild dog, have had to be patient. They only qualified for their first AFCON ever in 2017. Since then, it’s been a four-peat and they’ve reached every AFCON tournament. The man often attributed with the team’s success is head coach Baciro Candé, who is enjoying his second spell in charge. He’s seen the difficult years and the enjoyable ones, as he’s qualified the national team for four successive AFCONs. One player Candé will look to is the experienced Piqueti Djassi, and his coaches have put their trust in him to take advantage of opportunities where and when they present themselves. With seven goals, the 30-year-old — a former youth international for Portugal — is now Guinea-Bissau’s second-highest goal scorer in history and, behind Mendes, the second-highest appearance maker. Piqueti scored one of just two goals the national team has scored in their three finals appearances and was crucial for the Djurtus in the 2019 and 2021 AFCON qualifiers. In the 2021 AFCON, Guinea-Bissau came closest to their maiden win in AFCON history. Midfielder Pepe saw his penalty in the 82nd minute saved by Sudan goalkeeper Ali Abou Achrine. Piqueti’s rebound struck the bar as Sudan held on to a goalless draw. The result meant that for a third successive AFCON, Guinea-Bissau had picked up just one point in the group stages. Qualification to the finals has become a norm now for the Djurtus, and their record of participating in the four straight tournaments is better than Nigeria, Guinea, Burkina Faso and the DR Congo. The next step for Candé and his men is to get that first elusive win at a major tournament. Two years ago, they found themselves in Nigeria’s group and kept the Super Eagles at bay for 55 minutes. This time the entire 2.1 million population of Guinea-Bissau will no doubt have renewed hope that it could be fourth time lucky. Want more AFCON preview content?

Here, we look at why signing Timo Werner might actually work out for Ange Postecoglou. Given Timo Werner is known to Premier League watchers as a striker who can’t finish, there hasn’t been much clamour for his return. In the 18 months since he left Chelsea, there can’t have been many problems to which many fans thought the German forward was the answer. And yet, when news broke last week that Tottenham were looking to complete a loan deal for Werner, it strangely made a lot of sense. Tottenham have been contending with a barely believable availability crisis this season, with attacking players in James Maddison, Ivan Perisic and Alejo Véliz all currently out, and star forward and captain Son Heung-min now likely missing for a month or more on international duty at the Asian Cup with South Korea. Their attacking ranks have been depleted to such an extent that the ineffective Bryan Gil was their only senior, match-fit attacker on the bench for the FA Cup win over Burnley on Friday. If the names on the teamsheet didn’t already make it clear, their blunt attacking display in that game showed how much Spurs need another attacking option available. Werner isn’t perfect, nor is he going to be match fit, having played a total of just 250 minutes in the Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League for RB Leipzig this season, and having made only two substitute appearances totalling 39 minutes since October. His numbers from his time at Chelsea tell the story that we all remember: of a player devoid of confidence who was either ill-suited to the Premier League or struggled to deal with the expectations of a hefty price tag after his £47.5 million move. Werner scored just 10 Premier League goals in two years in England. In that time, he played 3,889 minutes of top-flight football, meaning he averaged a goal every 389 minutes. That’s a goal roughly every six and a half hours, or every 4.3 football matches. He missed chances at an alarming rate. He had shots worth 18.3 expected goals, with his underperformance compared to his xG (8.3) representing the worst finishing record by any Premier League player over those two seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22). Another way of looking at those numbers, though, would be to focus on the impressive consistency with which Werner got into positions to threaten the opposition’s goal. In fact, during his time in England, he ranked 10th for non-penalty xG per 90 minutes played (0.42) of players to play at least 2,500 minutes. His movement, work rate and pace led to lots of chances, even if he doesn’t finish them very well. Although his return to Leipzig hasn’t been entirely successful, not least because he has lost his place in the team this season, there have been some notable improvements. His non-penalty xG per 90 has risen ever so slightly (0.44) – putting him seventh in the Bundesliga (min. 2,000 minutes played) – and, crucially, he scored far more efficiently. His 11 goals came from just 11.4 xG – meaning he scored at roughly an average rate – scoring every 195 minutes on average. Neither are particularly outstanding rates, but Werner’s finishing simply isn’t world class. As time has gone on, the 28 Bundesliga goals he scored from 21.3 xG in 2019-20 appear increasingly like a hot streak rather than a sign of an elite finisher. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou will of course hope Werner can chip in with some goals, particularly given Brennan Johnson has just one in 14 appearances since joining for £50m from Nottingham Forest in the summer. Meanwhile, there is no banking on Richarlison extending his current run of five goals in five league games. But goals won’t have been the only (or even the main) reason Spurs have moved for Werner. The potential upside for little risk makes the deal a no-brainer, with Tottenham bringing in a forward who has Premier League experience on a relatively cheap loan that requires them only to cover the player’s wages. If it goes well, they have the option to buy him for around £15m. Although Postecoglou surely wouldn’t have turned down the opportunity to spend £100m on the perfect striker this January, financially that isn’t an option for Spurs right now. And given they invested so heavily in recent years on Johnson and Richarlison, what they really need in this window is a player to compete with the attackers already in the squad rather than jump straight ahead of them in the pecking order and stunt 22-year-old Johnson’s development and cause Richarlison’s value to drop. The hope will be that Werner’s tireless running, clever movement and breathtaking pace suit Postecoglou’s style of football so well that he slots in fairly seamlessly. He brings an element of chaos to attacks; having hit a top speed of 22.2 mph while at Chelsea, he was among the 20 fastest players in the league across his two years in London. All too often he was too keen to use his pace to get in behind the opposition, though, caught offside 0.9 times per 90, the fourth-highest rate among players to play at least 2,500 minutes in that time. That will be something Postecoglou will have to improve. Postecoglou has his team press relentlessly and attack quickly and directly on the transition if they have the opportunity to catch the opposition when they are out of shape. That should suit Werner. Spurs have the second-lowest PPDA (passes per defensive action) in the Premier League this season (9.7), indicating they are the top flight’s second-most proactive team when out of possession. They are also hugely effective with their pressing, ranking first for high turnovers – regains made within 40m of the opposition’s goal line – (203), second for high turnovers leading to a shot (37), and joint first for high turnovers leading to a goal (6). While Son, who leads the Premier League this season for pressures in the final third leading to a turnover (71), is away on international duty, Spurs’ forwards will need extra help to maintain their impressive pressing numbers. When attacking over longer distances, though, Spurs still have some improving to do, and this is where Werner’s pace and ability to carry the ball up the field at speed could prove most useful. Spurs have had 50 direct attacks – defined as an open-play sequence that starts just inside their own half, has at least 50% movement towards the opposition’s goal, and ends in a shot or touch in the penalty area – this season, which is the Premier League’s second-highest tally behind Liverpool (55). However, Spurs have scored only one goal from these attacks, with 11 teams having scored more than them. Liverpool have scored five such goals, while Brighton have scored four goals from just 24 direct attacks. That’s one goal every six direct attacks compared to one every 50 for Spurs. Werner is largely thought of in England as an overrated striker who can’t score goals and flopped at Chelsea, but he now has another chance to prove himself in the Premier League. There is a quality player in there (remember, he did win the Champions League with Chelsea, starting in the final and creating space for Kai Havertz to run through on goal and score the winner), and Postecoglou appears to be adept at getting the most from his players. Werner might end up leaving London once again with his reputation in England in much the same state, but there are also some positive reasons to believe things could turn out differently for him this time around.

Our latest edition includes numbers on Newcastle, Timo Werner and Manchester City. It was FA Cup third round weekend in England, though it was slim on giant killings. National League South side Maidstone United did reach the fourth round after beating League One Stevenage, with the team managed by former Wolves left-back George Elokobi setting up a tie against Ipswich Town. The television people clearly thought a shock might arrive at the Stadium of Light in the Wear-Tyne derby between Sunderland and Newcastle United. It didn’t, but you can understand why they thought it might when you see the Magpies’ away form this season. Ahead of hosting Manchester City this weekend, we look at the vast difference between Newcastle’s home and away success. Timo Werner appears to be heading back to the Premier League with Tottenham, so we’ve also glanced at the Germany international’s record from his time at Chelsea. We also have our quiz, ‘Ask Opta’ and links to all kinds of data-driven goodness on the\\xa0Opta Analyst\\xa0website. How could anyone ever ask for more?

That has nothing to do with anything really, though it ties in nicely with our look at Newcastle this week. Eddie Howe’s men had a tough-looking assignment against rivals Sunderland in the FA Cup, but their quality told as they ran out 3-0 winners at the home of the Black Cats, including a brace for Alexander Isak. It was just Newcastle’s third away win of the season in 13 games in all competitions, their others being the 8-0 thrashing of Sheffield United in the Premier League and a 3-0 victory at Manchester United in the EFL Cup. Just looking at Premier League games this season, Newcastle have the second-worst away record in the division (five points). Coincidentally, only the one team they have bested on the road this season, Sheffield United (two points), have a worse return from away games. Perhaps they just need to learn to spread their goals out a bit more. Thanks to their eight against the Blades, they have actually scored more goals in away games (16) than Arsenal (15), though Mikel Arteta’s men have accrued 12 more points than them on the road. However, Newcastle have kept St James’ Park, well, not quite a fortress, but still a tough place to visit. In fact, they have the third-best home record in the Premier League this season, ahead of the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham and – though having played a game more – Man City, whom they host on Saturday. With 24 of their 29 points so far coming at home, it should make them feel better about their chances against City, or alternatively, could put even more pressure on it. Their 82.8% of points won at home this season is currently the fifth most by any team in a season\\xa0in Premier League history, behind Burnley 2009-10 (26 of 30 – 86.7%), Leeds United 1992-93 (44 of 51 – 86.3%), Fulham 2005-06 (41 of 48 – 85.4%) and Coventry City 1999-2000 (37 of 44 – 84.1%). If all else fails for Newcastle in away games, they could always try decorating their opponents’ stadium as if it’s their own… sorry Sunderland fans, too soon? It’s Timo time, again. Tottenham are reportedly bringing Timo Werner back to the Premier League, presumably because they so enjoyed his first stint in England’s top flight. Tongue removed from cheek,\\xa0we think there’s a good chance Werner could be a shrewd move, especially in Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs setup. However, there’s no denying Werner struggled to live up to his hype when he moved from RB Leipzig to Chelsea in 2020. In the Premier League he scored just 10 goals from shots worth 18.3 expected goals (xG), with his underperformance compared to his xG (8.3) the worst finishing record by any player in the competition over those two seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22). It never quite clicked for Werner in England the first time around, albeit he was far from the only attacking player who struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge after a big-money move. As the viz above shows, though, his xG did spike near the end of his time in London, and he started well when back in Leipzig in 2022-23. In his first spell at Leipzig, Werner scored 78 Bundesliga goals from an xG of 66.76, and in his second spell he managed 11 from 11.4 xG. He could end up being an interesting proposition in a Spurs team who like to attack at pace. So, Spurs fans don’t need to fret and can just dream of how funny it will be if Werner ends up being a huge success with them instead of London rivals Chelsea. The magic of the cup is no match for our magic of the quiz (so say us, admittedly with some bias). Here’s five statty FA Cup third round questions for you to wrestle with. Answers at the bottom of the page. 1.\\xa0At 39 years and 106 days, Chelsea’s Thiago Silva scored against Preston and became the oldest player to find the net for a Premier League club in the FA Cup since which former England striker did so in 2006? 2.\\xa0Aston Villa’s 1-0 win at Middlesbrough was their first win in the FA Cup since a victory in a third-round replay in 2015-16, ending an eight-match losing streak in the competition.

This week’s question comes via X from Samuel (@blufferfish089) who asks: “My dad wanted to know this: since Pep Guardiola came to Man City, do they have the most 5-0 victories out of any team, and perhaps more interestingly, how does 5-0 compare to City’s other results in terms of frequency? (i.e: have they won 5-0 more than they’ve won 1-0?)” Do you have a stat-based question you’d like Opta to answer in a future edition of SVQ? Email us at\\xa0editors@theanalyst.com\\xa0or message us on X\\xa0@OptaAnalyst\\xa0with #AskOpta and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: Not wanting to disappoint Samuel’s dad, we had a look at Guardiola’s record at securing 5-0 wins. Following their win by that very score against Huddersfield Town on Sunday, Manchester City have won by 5+ goals on 42 occasions under Guardiola, more than twice as many times as any other Premier League side since the Spaniard took over in 2016-17. As for comparing it to any other score, a 5-0 win is the seventh most common scoreline for Man City since Pep’s arrival in all competitions. They have recorded such a margin of victory 24 times, which is not as often as they have won 1-0 (39 times). City’s most common score under Guardiola is a 2-1 win (47 times), which is the fourth most common of any score in that time among Premier League teams in all competitions. Manchester United have won 1-0 50 times in that period, while Liverpool winning 2-0 has happened 49 times and Chelsea winning 2-1 has occurred 48 times. Man City’s other most common scores have been 2-0 (43 times), 3-1 (42 times), 3-0 (37 times) and 1-1 (29 times). They have, though, won 5-0 more often than they’ve won 4-0 (23 times), 4-1 (22 times), drawn 0-0 (17 times) or lost 1-0 (16 times).

Can Jürgen Klopp’s side give themselves a first-leg lead at Anfield? After a dramatic seven-goal thriller when they met in the Premier League last month, Liverpool and Fulham are ready to do it all again in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup. Jürgen Klopp’s side ran out 4-3 winners at Anfield but had to come from 3-2 down late on to turn things around, and now find themselves top of the table as well as in the final four of the EFL Cup. They are making their 19th appearance in the EFL Cup semi-finals, more than any other side. They’ve also reached the final (13) and won the competition (9) more times than anyone else. This will be Fulham’s first appearance in the semi-finals of this competition. The last time a first-time semi-finalist reached the final of the EFL Cup was in 2012-13, with Bradford City and Swansea City both doing so. Liverpool have never lost when playing the first leg of an EFL Cup semi-final at home, winning five and drawing three. They have also gone on to reach the final on six of the eight occasions their first leg has been at Anfield. In the last round, Fulham dumped Everton out of the competition on penalties at Goodison Park. There have been four occasions of a team eliminating both Merseyside clubs in the same EFL Cup campaign – Manchester City in 1969-70 and 2015-16 (winning the trophy both times), Arsenal in 2006-07 (losing the final) and Chelsea in 2007-08 (losing the final). Trent Alexander-Arnold fired in the winner for Liverpool against Fulham last month but will be unavailable for this one after hyper-extending his knee in the FA Cup win against Arsenal at the weekend. He will be missed by the hosts, having provided five assists in his last four EFL Cup appearances for Liverpool, averaging an assist every 54 minutes in these games. Former Red Harry Wilson, as well as Kenny Tete and Bobby De Cordova-Reid, were on the scoresheet for Fulham in their 4-3 loss at Liverpool. The last Fulham player to score in two separate games against Liverpool in a single campaign was Collins John in 2005-06. As for team news, Liverpool will also be without Joël Matip, Andrew Robertson, Kostas Tsimikas, Dominik Szoboszlai, Thiago Alcântara and Stefan Bajcetic through injury, while Wataru Endo and Mohamed Salah are away on international duty. Captain Virgil van Dijk will be available, though, after missing the Arsenal game through illness. Fulham will be without Adama Traoré, who remains sidelined, but should welcome back Raúl Jiménez and João\\xa0Palhinha, who were both unused substitutes for the 1-0 FA Cup third round win over Rotherham United on Friday. Liverpool have lost just one of their last 11 meetings with Fulham (W8 D2) in all competitions (all in the Premier League since 2012) and as mentioned, have already beaten them 4-3 at Anfield this season. A Bernd Leno own goal was followed by goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Wataru Endo and Alexander-Arnold as Liverpool fought off a resilient Fulham to eventually secure three points. The Reds have progressed from all five of their previous League Cup ties against Fulham, most recently a 3-0 quarter-final win on their way to lifting the trophy in 2000-01. These results also include a 10-0 victory in September 1986 (the joint-biggest win in the competition’s history), and a 5-0 win in October 1993 that saw a young Robbie Fowler score all five goals.  Fulham have lost their last two visits to Anfield, but did win 1-0 there in the Premier League in March 2021. Liverpool have only lost one league game at home since (2-1 vs Leeds United last season). Liverpool come into this game having won their last three games in all competitions, including a 2-0 win at Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup last Sunday. They drew with the Gunners just before Christmas, before beating Burnley and Newcastle United. The Reds have beaten Leicester City, Bournemouth and West Ham to reach this stage of the EFL Cup. Fulham had a mixed time of things over the Christmas period, losing against Burnley and Bournemouth before securing a win over Arsenal and beating Rotherham in the FA Cup. The Cottagers have eliminated Tottenham, Norwich City, Ipswich Town and Everton to get to the final four of this competition. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is very confident that Liverpool will take a lead with them into the second leg at Craven Cottage. The first-leg hosts have been given a 73.5% chance of winning at Anfield on Wednesday. Fulham almost took something from their league game there just over a month ago, and have been handed an 11.1% chance of avenging that with a win this time. The draw, which would also be a good result for Marco Silva’s men to take back home with them, happened in 15.4% of the supercomputer’s 10,000 simulations. Enjoy this?

The Opta supercomputer has delivered its 2023 AFCON predictions as tournament hosts Ivory Coast look to dethrone reigning champions Senegal. Better late than never, the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations kicks off on Saturday, with 24 teams competing to be crowned kings of the continent.\\xa0 Hosts Ivory Coast get the tournament – which was pushed back due to weather concerns after originally being scheduled for last summer – underway against Guinea-Bissau, with Nigeria, Egypt and Ghana also in action on the opening weekend. Will the tournament bring a first international title for Mohamed Salah, or can his former Liverpool teammate Sadio Mané help Senegal defend the trophy? Will Ivory Coast impress on home soil, or could Victor Osimhen fire Nigeria to glory? As Africa gears up for a festival of football, we’ve got all those questions covered in our Africa Cup of Nations predictions below. Comprehensive, data-driven group-by-group previews can be found here. Where else to start but with the champions? No team has defended the AFCON trophy since Egypt won a third straight title in 2010, but Aliou Cissé’s team could be set for another deep run. They will have to navigate Group C, which also includes Gambia, Cameroon and Guinea, who boast Stuttgart’s in-form striker Serhou Guirassy. The holders are given an 88.8% chance of reaching the last 16 and a 47.4% likelihood of topping their group. Having scored the winning spot-kick against Egypt after a goalless draw in the final of the delayed 2021 tournament in 2022, Mané will wear the captain’s armband again. His eight goals since moving to the Saudi Pro League only put him third among Al-Nassr players this season, with Cristiano Ronaldo boasting 20 and Talisca hitting 11. However, he leads all players in the league for open-play expected assists (xA) per 90 minutes, with 0.32. If Mané can create the chances, he’ll feel he has teammates capable of putting them away. Salernitana’s Boulaye Dia has 20 Serie A goals from 12.4 expected goals (xG) since the start of last season, with only Inter’s Lautaro Martínez (+8.7) recording a better overperformance during that time. Dia boasts a shot conversion rate of 27% during that time, the highest of any Serie A player to hit at least 12 goals. It’s been a different story for Nicolas Jackson, who has been criticised for his wastefulness since joining Chelsea, netting seven Premier League goals from 10.59 xG. Jackson has a knack for getting into the right areas, though, averaging the fourth highest xG per 90 among all players to play 600+ minutes in the Premier League this term with 0.66, behind Erling Haaland (0.81), Callum Wilson (0.71) and Darwin Núñez (0.70). Édouard Mendy and company kept five clean sheets in seven games at the last AFCON and should provide a solid base. If their star-studded frontline clicks, Senegal should be there or thereabouts. One of Africa’s traditional heavyweights, Ivory Coast have not been beyond the AFCON quarter-finals since last winning the tournament in 2015. On home soil, they are our second favourites to win their third title, triumphing in 12.1% of the supercomputer’s tournament simulations.\\xa0\\xa0 Jean-Louis Gasset’s team will be confident of seeing off Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea in Group A, and a meeting with Nigeria could decide top spot. The hosts are given a 38.5% chance of finishing first compared to the Super Eagles’ 40.1%, but the supercomputer clearly gives the edge to the Ivorians when it comes to the knockout stages. They have a 53.4% chance of making the quarter-finals, a slight tick above Nigeria’s 48.5%. English audiences will be familiar with many of Les Éléphants’ stars, including Brighton and Hove Albion’s Simon Adingra. Adingra must give opposition full-backs sleepless nights, having recorded 14 chance-creating carries in the Premier League this term. Only Kaoru Mitoma (24) and João Pedro (15) have more for the Seagulls. Alongside Sébastien Haller, Ivory Coast can also call upon Max Gradel – who is participating at his seventh AFCON – and Jérémie Boga, who has starred for Nice in Ligue 1 this term. He has averaged 11.8 progressive carries per 90 in the competition, with his per-90 progressive carry distance of 135.9 metres only bettered by PSG’s Ousmane Dembélé (212.2), Moses Simon (157.8) and Edon Zhegrova (142.7, minimum 900 minutes played). The hosts also boast an outstanding up-and-coming centre-back in Sporting CP’s Ousmane Diomande, who has been linked with Arsenal and Newcastle United. Among all defenders in Portugal’s Primeira Liga, the 20-year-old ranks second for total carries (272), and fourth for total carry distance (2,736 metres), progressive carries (150) and progressive carry distance (1,527 metres) this campaign. Should Ivory Coast reach the final in Abidjan on 11 February, their fans should at least be prepared for a tense finish. Les Éléphants’ previous AFCON final wins both came via spot-kicks after goalless draws with Ghana in 1992 and 2015. The scorelines in those shoot-outs? 11-10 and 9-8! Morocco have not been champions of African football since 1976, but they are our third favourites after stunning the globe with a fourth-place finish at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Having been drawn into Group F alongside Tanzania, DR Congo and Zambia, Walid Regragui’s team are given an 11.1% chance of lifting the trophy. Morocco claimed the scalps of Spain and Portugal with backs-to-the-wall defensive performances in Qatar, allowing the ninth-most passes per defensive action (18.3) at that tournament as they absorbed pressure before striking on the break. Now-Manchester United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat made the most recoveries (57) of any player at that World Cup and should play a prominent role again, though Morocco may require a more proactive approach against inferior opponents. Azzedine Ounahi – whose five chance-creating carries were only bettered by Kylian Mbappé (eight) and Lionel Messi (six) in Qatar – should offer dynamism in midfield, while right-back Achraf Hakimi will bring additional creativity. Only Dembélé (54) has created more chances than Hakimi (42) for Paris Saint-Germain in 2023-24, while his 14 chance-creating carries have only been bettered by Dembélé (29) and Mbappé (15) among his teammates. Morocco top Group F in 53.6% of our tournament simulations and doing so could put them on the path to a quarter-final rematch with Egypt, who eliminated them at that stage of the 2021 AFCON. Group winner – 53.6%Reach last 16 – 89.7%Reach quarter-finals – 55.6%Reach semi-finals – 33.2%Reach final – 19.3%Winner – 11.1% Two-time AFCON champions Algeria are always among the favourites and the supercomputer gives them a 9.7% chance of glory, which would make up for their dismal group-stage exit at the last edition. Boss Djamel Belmadi survived that campaign and will be demanding more after Algeria were drawn into Group D, alongside Angola, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The Desert Foxes’ 57.5% chance of topping their group is the highest assigned to any team at the tournament. Riyad Mahrez will captain the 1990 and 2019 winners, having recorded 15 goal involvements (eight goals, seven assists) in 19 league appearances for Al-Ahli since leaving Manchester City. Mahrez was an ultra-reliable performer throughout five years at the Etihad Stadium, contributing to 134 goals at an average of one every 113 minutes. Could the 32-year-old be set for one last hurrah on the international stage? Teammate Mohamed Amoura could enjoy a breakout tournament after starring for Belgian Pro League leaders Union Saint-Gilloise. Amoura has 13 goals in 15 league matches this season, averaging one every 65.9 minutes. That is easily the best minutes-per-goal ratio in the league among players with a minimum of 270 minutes, with his club-mate Gustaf Nilsson second (96.1). Algeria claimed the most points of any side during qualifying (16) and will certainly back themselves to improve on their last AFCON performance. Group winner – 57.5%Reach last 16 – 91.5%Reach quarter-finals – 56.1%Reach semi-finals – 30.9%Reach final – 17.4%Winner – 9.7% The most successful team in AFCON history with seven titles, Egypt are ranked as fifth favourites by the supercomputer as they look to atone for their final defeat to Senegal two years ago, when Salah was memorably denied the chance to take their fifth penalty. Salah has never won this trophy, but he could become the first Egyptian to score at four different AFCON tournaments, having previously netted at the 2017, 2019 and 2021 editions. Salah is enjoying an outstanding campaign with Liverpool, averaging 0.72 goals per 90 in the Premier League this season, a figure he has only bettered in 2017-18 (0.99) and 2021-22 (0.75). He now sits tenth in the competition’s all-time goalscoring charts with 153. While Salah remains Egypt’s talisman, Rui Vitória has other attackers capable of sharing the load. Nantes striker Mostafa Mohamed has 16 Ligue 1 goals since the start of last season and should add a focal point, with five of those efforts coming via headers. Since the start of 2022-23, only Loïs Openda and Jérémy Le Douaron (six) have more headed goals in Ligue 1. Omar Marmoush is also a man in form, netting 12 goals for Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023-24. Among Bundesliga players, only Bayern’s Harry Kane (25), Guirassy (19), Victor Boniface (16) and Openda (15) have more across all competitions. Egypt are given a 47.2% chance of topping Group B, though they could have a battle on their hands as a clash with Ghana (32.1%) is sandwiched between fixtures against Mozambique and Cape Verde. Keeping West Ham forward Mohammed Kudus quiet will be key when Egypt face the Black Stars. Of all players with at least three Premier League goals this campaign, only three average more non-penalty goals per 90 than Kudus’ 0.56, namely Chris Wood (0.74), Haaland (0.70) and Wilson (0.62). Group winner – 47.2%Reach last 16 – 88.0%Reach quarter-finals – 53.9%Reach semi-finals – 29.6%Reach final – 16.0%Winner – 8.5% After winning their third AFCON in 2013, Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 editions, then finished third in 2019 and suffered a last-16 exit at the hands of Tunisia last time out. Boss José Peseiro will be confident of a better display this time around should his star attackers click. Napoli talisman Osimhen was the leading scorer in qualification, with his 10 goals at least twice as many as any other player (four players had five). Since the last AFCON ended on February 6, 2022, just four players have scored more goals in the big five European leagues than Osimhen’s 42 – Mbappé (65), Kane (63), Haaland (56) and Martínez (47). The injury to fellow striker Victor Boniface will place added onus on Osimhen’s ability to lead Nigeria’s attack.  Boniface is undoubtedly a big loss for Peseiro’s side: the Bayer Leverkusen striker has 10 goals and seven assists in 16 Bundesliga appearances this term, with only Leroy Sané (eight) bettering that latter tally.  Nice’s Terem Moffi has been called up to replace him. Still, the Super Eagles have plenty of dynamism behind that duo, with only nine Premier League players bettering Alex Iwobi’s tally of 13 shot-ending carries for Fulham in 2023-24. Atalanta’s Ademola Lookman should start off the left, and he ranks second in Serie A for open-play goals per 90 this campaign (0.56), behind only Martínez (0.94). The Nigerians have a 8.1% chance of lifting the trophy, though they must first navigate a tricky Group A, facing Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau either side of a clash with the hosts on January 18. Group winner – 40.1%Reach last 16 – 85.3%Reach quarter-finals – 48.5%Reach semi-finals – 27.6%Reach final – 15.3%Winner – 8.1% Cameroon’s five AFCON titles are only bettered by Egypt’s seven, and the Pharaohs inflicted home heartbreak on the Indomitable Lions two years ago. Cameroon failed to convert three of their four spot-kicks as they lost a semi-final shoot-out in Yaoundé. With their former defender Rigobert Song at the helm, Cameroon are given a 7.4% chance of lifting the trophy, though that will surely increase if they overcome Senegal on Matchday 2 in Group C. Manchester United’s André Onana will be between the sticks after reversing his international retirement last September, and while he was criticised over a series of high-profile UEFA Champions League errors, his shot-stopping statistics speak for themselves. \\xa0 Onana’s save percentage of 71.9% is the third highest among Premier League goalkeepers in 2023-24, and according to Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) model, his figure of 3.8 goals prevented puts him fourth in the division. At the other end, Cameroon will again be captained by 2021’s Golden Boot winner Vincent Aboubakar. He scored eight goals from 13 shots on target across seven games two years ago, while Karl Toko Ekambi netted five times. With an ankle injury sidelining Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, the two 31-year-olds will carry Cameroon’s hopes again. In Napoli’s André-Frank Zambo Anguissa, Cameroon also boast a box-to-box midfielder capable of turning defence into attack in an instant, with no player in Serie A winning possession to start shot-ending sequences more often in 2023-24 than him (10 times). Group winner – 33.5%Reach last 16 – 82.3%Reach quarter-finals – 47.6%Reach semi-finals – 27.8%Reach final – 14.9%Winner – 7.4% Tunisia (6.3%) are one of the sides that make up an extremely evenly-matched Group E. Mali (3.7%) are also in there, as well as South Africa (2.1%) and Namibia (0.5%). Despite being one of the biggest outsiders, Namibia still have a very credible 42.4% of at least getting out of Group E. Such is the parity of this group on paper that Tunisia – who are favourites to progress to the last 16 – have an 84.6% chance of doing so. That’s the lowest mark of any of the group favourites to make it through to the knockout stages. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Well, the Opta supercomputer has delivered its 2023 Asian Cup predictions as tournament hosts Qatar look to defend their continental crown against tough competition including Australia, Japan and South Korea. The calendar year of 2024 will be a big one for major international football tournaments, with the AFC Asian Cup 2023 among many key events taking place. A frenetic year begins with an intriguing Asian Cup that will run at the same time as the Africa Cup of Nations, with Euro 2024 and the Copa América scheduled for the summer. The Asian Cup, officially the 2023 edition of the competition even though it will run from 12 January to 10 February of this year, will kick off when hosts Qatar take on Lebanon in Group A on Friday for the first of 51 matches. Qatar were crowned continental champions for the first time in 2019, defeating record four-time winners Japan in the final, and will be under pressure to produce another meaningful run as they play on home soil. Japan are again among the leading contenders to triumph in Asian football’s biggest competition, as are major nations like Australia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Son Heung-min’s South Korea, who are looking to end their long wait for glory in the competition, having last triumphed in 1960. Which teams are most likely to go all the way and are there any sides who could upset the odds with a surprise run to the latter stages? Let’s find out by reviewing the Opta supercomputer’s AFC Asian Cup predictions. Japan are rated as the favourites to win the tournament by our predictive model. The Samurai Blue, skippered by Liverpool midfielder Wataru Endo, come into the event with their impressive World Cup performance – which saw them shockingly top a group including Germany and Spain – fresh in the mind. Japan have a magnificent record at the Asian Cup, having reached the final in five of their nine appearances. Their four championship titles are a competition record, with all those wins coming in the modern era since they started their run of success in 1992. At 17th in the FIFA world rankings, they are also the highest-ranked AFC nation. Japan are almost certain to progress from Group D and are given a 97.2% chance of reaching the last 16, doing so as group winners in almost three-quarters (72.9%) of our tournament simulations, with Iraq (15.9%) likely to be the only team capable of challenging them for top spot. Endo will hope to lift the trophy and should expect to reach the semi-finals, according to the Opta supercomputer, as Japan do so at a rate of 52.8%. To illustrate the gulf between them and the chasing pack, the next-most likely team to reach the last four is South Korea and their chance is much lower at 39.9%. Japan win the tournament in 24.6% of our simulations, so they go into the event as clear favourites and the team to beat. Endo is part of a strong list of midfield options for coach Hajime Moriyasu, while the defence also looks resolute, containing Arsenal star Takehiro Tomiyasu. Japan’s main concerns may be at either end of the pitch. They have named three goalkeepers who are inexperienced at international level – none of them started 2024 with more than four caps – while ex-Liverpool player Takumi Minamino (18), who now plays for Monaco, and Reims’ Junya Ito (13) are the only two players with double figures for international goals. However, there is huge quality in a squad that contains exciting talents like Kaoru Mitoma (if he is fit enough to play a part as the Brighton star battles an ankle injury), Takefusa Kubo and Ritsu Doan. Group winner – 72.9%Reach last 16 – 97.2%Reach quarter-finals – 73.2%Reach semi-finals – 52.8%Reach final – 36.7%Winner – 24.6% South Korea won the first two editions of the Asia Cup in 1956 and 1960, but they make their 15th appearance in the finals still waiting for a third success. They have made the final four times since their last victory, most recently in 2015 when they were beaten by Australia in extra-time. Like Japan, they reached the knockout stages of the World Cup and boast a talented squad that includes Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae and Paris Saint-Germain star Lee Kang-in. Two in-form Premier League forwards are also among their options. Tottenham’s Son Heung-min and Wolves’ Hwang Hee-chan have 22 goals between them in England’s top flight already in 2023-24 and will be sorely missed by their clubs. It’s an impressive lineup and South Korea may feel their time is now. Son will captain a team who are rated as the second-most likely tournament winners by our model at 14.3%. They should expect to progress from Group E, a pool which they win in 67.3% of our simulations and they can also be confident of reaching the last eight (62.2%). South Korea make it to what would be a record seventh Asian Cup final a quarter of the time (24.9%), so expect Jürgen Klinsmann’s team to prove strong contenders. Group winner – 67.3%Reach last 16 – 95.1%Reach quarter-finals – 62.2%Reach semi-finals – 39.9%Reach final – 24.9%Winner – 14.3% Iran are a must-watch team at the Asian Cup. They have won the most matches in tournament history (41) and have also scored the most goals (131). Iran also hold the longest consecutive run of participation, appearing now for the 15th time in a streak that started in 1968. Unbeaten in their last 20 group-stage matches (W15 D5) since losing to Iraq in 1996, it looks like Iran are poised to make the latter stages once again. They are the second-highest ranked AFC nation by FIFA, at 21 in the world, and come into the Asian Cup as our third favourites, winning the tournament at a rate of 11.2%. Iran are three-time continental champions, winning on all three occasions when they have reached the final, although that last happened in 1976. Amir Ghalenoei has impressed since replacing Carlos Queiroz as boss, and United Arab Emirates are the only nation likely to be able to challenge them in Group C, which they win in 58.4% of our simulations. Iran reach the semis at least a third of the time (34.9%), with Porto forward Mehdi Taremi and Roma attacker Sardar Azmoun set to be key to Team Melli’s hopes. Group winner – 58.4%Reach last 16 – 93.2%Reach quarter-finals – 63.0%Reach semi-finals – 34.9%Reach final – 21.2%Winner – 11.2% Australia will appear at the tournament for a fifth time, having finished as runners-up in 2011 and then triumphed in 2015 before suffering a shock quarter-final elimination at the hands of UAE last time out in 2019. The Socceroos have a squad with a decent mix of youth and experience, without containing any global stars. They impressed at the World Cup by reaching the last 16 before losing narrowly to eventual winners Argentina, and should be able to navigate their way out of Group B. Australia and Uzbekistan are set to battle for first place, with Syria and India likely to find competing with those two nations a tough challenge. Graham Arnold’s side should expect to reach the last eight as a minimum, as they reach that stage in 62.0% of our simulations, and they have a better than one in five chance (20.4%) of going all the way to the final, with their 10.7% win percentage falling only just short of Iran. They are one of the four AFC teams (Japan, Iran and South Korea are the other three) in the top 25 of the FIFA rankings and there is a notable gap from there, with no other team in the top 50. Group winner – 56.4%Reach last 16 – 92.4%Reach quarter-finals – 62.0%Reach semi-finals – 37.7%Reach final – 20.4%Winner – 10.7% Six-time finalists and three-time winners Saudi Arabia should be fascinating to watch as they seek their first Asian Cup title since 1996 and a first final appearance since 2007. An influx of talent into the Saudi Pro League over the last year is only likely to have helped a team of homegrown players that impressively took down Argentina in the World Cup group stage. Al-Hilal’s Salem Al-Dawsari has been one of the most impressive Pro League performers this season, while Firas Al-Buraikan – who joined Al-Ahli this year – is a prolific domestic scorer yet to hit his peak on the international stage. Looking to repeat their 1988 success on Qatari soil, Saudi Arabia are strongly fancied to top Group F as they battle with Oman for top spot. Kyrgyzstan and Thailand are expected to find it tough to compete with the Saudis. Saudi Arabia should make it to the last eight, doing so in 60.1% of the simulations run by the supercomputer and have a strong chance of reaching the last four at 35.9%. While their chances begin to drop from there, they still come into the tournament as fifth favourites to win it (10.6%), with comparable hopes to Iran and Australia despite those sides being ranked higher. Group winner – 60.5%Reach last 16 – 93.5%Reach quarter-finals – 60.1%Reach semi-finals – 35.9%Reach final – 19.0%Winner – 10.6% It will be tough for hosts Qatar to repeat their success from 2019, although at 9.8% their chances of winning again should not be completely discounted. The hosts may need to get off to a fast start, as they only top Group A 50.1% of the time, with China (25.1%) having the potential to cause them a few problems. Progression to the last 16 (88.6%) should not be a problem, though. Qatar, who become the only team to have hosted the competition three times, are more likely than not to reach the quarter-finals (58.6%) and have an 18.7% hope of reaching back-to-back finals in the competition. However, the odds are against them, as in the last seven Asian Cups, Australia (in 2015) are the only host nation to have won, while it is 20 years since the title was successfully defended. Strong performances are needed from forwards Almoez Ali and Akram Afif, who have each racked up over 100 caps for the national team. Ali scored nine goals in 2019, the most a player has managed in a single competition, and was named the tournament MVP as a result. Afif, meanwhile, provided the most assists (10) and created the most chances (26) in any edition since 2007. Group winner – 50.0%Reach last 16 – 88.6%Reach quarter-finals – 58.6%Reach semi-finals – 34.5%Reach final – 18.7%Winner – 9.8% Outside of the leading six, there are only four teams given a greater than 2.0% chance of triumphing at the tournament. Those teams are United Arab Emirates (2.9%), Uzbekistan (2.5%), Iraq (2.4%) and China (2.2%). Iraq won the Asian Cup in 2007 and are the only team likely to challenge Japan in Group D, winning that pool in 15.9% of our simulations and coming second in the group 40.6% of the time. They reach the last 16 74.9% of the time and may be a team many of the favourites want to avoid facing in the last 16. As well as their 2007 success, Iraq were semi-finalists in 2015. UAE were runners-up in 1996 and are expected to progress from Group C with Iran, while China have made the final on two occasions, most recently in 2004. They make at least the quarter-finals at a rate of 63.8% according to the supercomputer, so could be a team to watch out for. Uzbekistan reached the semi-finals in 2011, which was the last time Qatar hosted the event, and they have a decent 18.7% chance of making it through to the last four again here. This tournament has a similar make-up to the last Asian Cup, as 20 of the 24 teams also participated in 2019. Of the four countries that did not take part last time, Tajikistan are the only debutants in the competition, although few will remember Hong Kong’s last appearance, which came way back in 1968. Malaysia and Indonesia are the other two teams who qualified this time after not playing in the previous editions. Those two nations hosted the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and have not got through the qualifiers since, with neither country ever managing to make it past the group stage in any of their previous appearances. But the tournament format means all four teams go into the event with at least a fighting chance of making the last 16, which would represent an impressive accomplishment. Hong Kong make the knockout stage in 37.1% of our simulations and have an outside chance (12.4%) of a dream run to the last eight. Simply winning a match would be a success, though, as they have never done that in 10 attempts at the tournament. Our model is more favourable to Tajikistan, who are in fact more likely than not (54.5%) to make the last 16 and even reach the semis 6.7% of the time, so a competitive Group A including Qatar, China, Tajikistan and Lebanon could be an entertaining watch. Malaysia (who have a 44.2% chance of reaching the last 16) will face South Korea, Jordan and Bahrain in the group stage, while Indonesia (38.3%) might also have a tough task as they battle Japan, Iraq and Vietnam in Group D.

Some familiar names and some less familiar names really produced during the calendar year, making EA Sports’ job of selecting nominees for the EA Sports FC 24 Team of the Year all the more difficult. With Opta providing data for EA Sports FC 24, we thought it would be appropriate to use Opta data to look at the nominees and come up with our own men’s TOTY selection. It’s just a bit of fun and you can go and make your own selection after you’ve read ours, but be sure to tell us why we’re wrong on social media. So, who made our XI? Like most of these selections, this was a difficult one. Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak had another very good year, conceding just 36 goals in all competitions and recording a save percentage of 75.5%. The Slovenian was also the only goalkeeper nominee not to record a single error that led to a goal all year. Borussia Dortmund’s Gregor Kobel was also a somewhat unlikely standout, helping his team come incredibly close to ending Bayern Munich’s stranglehold on the Bundesliga as he conceded just 53 goals from 66.5 expected goals on target conceded (xGOT) across 2023, by far the biggest positive differential of all the nominees. We’ve gone for Barcelona’s Marc-André ter Stegen, though, who helped the Catalan giants to the La Liga title and keeping a whopping 25 clean sheets across the year in all competitions, by far the most of all the nominees. He was also named the La Liga Player of the Season for 2022-23. Ter Stegen made 119 saves in total at a percentage of 75.8%, also the highest of all the nominees, conceding 38 goals in 47 games from 42.6 xGOT. We again start with honourable mentions. Of the list of defender nominees, no-one attempted (98) or successfully made (62) as many tackles as Mats Hummels, while no-one had a higher tackle success percentage than Bremer (80.8%), who also made last season’s team. Dante won possession most often (332) while Trent Alexander-Arnold led the way for assists (18) and chances created (108). Our right-back selection goes to Bayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong, though. With a staggering 26 goal involvements in 2023 in all competitions (11 goals, 15 assists), the former Celtic man was impossible to overlook. Frimpong also won 65.5% of his tackles (36 of 55) and created the most chances from open play of any of the nominees (81 – ahead of Alexander-Arnold’s 69). He also didn’t make a single error leading to an opposition shot, just one of four nominees who didn’t. Finally, Frimpong made 186 long progressive carries (10+ metres upfield) in the Bundesliga in 2023 – the most of any player. At left-back we very nearly opted for Frimpong’s Leverkusen teammate Álex Grimaldo. The Spaniard recorded nine goals and eight assists for Benfica and the German side in 2023 in just 28 games (25 starts), but we just gave the edge to Inter Milan’s Federico Dimarco. Like Grimaldo, the Italian also produced 17 goal involvements in 2023 (6 goals, 11 assists), while also playing a significant part in Inter’s run to the UEFA Champions League final. Only Alexander-Arnold created more chances than Dimarco’s 84 among the defender nominees, while he was also third for tackle success (72.6% – 37 of 51). For our centre-back selections we wanted to cover all bases. Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk was one of our picks last year, and he’s back again this time. Last season may not have been the best for Jürgen\\xa0Klopp’s team, but they finished strongly, and have started this one well too, in no small part due to Van Dijk appearing to get back to his best. The big Dutchman had the most clean sheets of any defender in the Premier League in 2023 (13) and won more aerial duels in all competitions than each of his fellow nominees (147), 21 more than the next most, which came from the man we’ve selected to partner him at centre-back. Bayern Munich’s Kim Min-jae mostly gets in for his work in securing Napoli their first Serie A title in 33 years, but the South Korea international has also been impressive since arriving in the Bundesliga. Of all the defender nominees, as well as being second for aerial duels won (126) he recorded the most interceptions (75) and was third for possession won (284). Kim also initiated five open-play sequences that ended in goals in the Champions League in 2023 – more than any other defender. Real Madrid’s Toni Kroos was perhaps unsurprisingly the nominee with the highest pass completion percentage (94.1%) in 2023, while probably more surprisingly, Bayern’s Jamal Musiala led the way for tackle success (77.6% – 38 of 49). They both narrowly miss out, though, as does Declan Rice. The Arsenal midfielder was well out in front of his fellow midfield nominees for interceptions (84) across his time with West Ham and the Gunners in 2023, but as we wanted a little bit of everything in our midfield, we felt it was a straight choice between him and Rodri, and the Manchester City man gets the nod. It’s not too difficult to see why. What a 2023 the Spain international had, winning a treble with Man City as well as the UEFA Nations League with his country, before ending the year with the FIFA Club World Cup. He attempted almost 1,000 more passes than any other midfield nominee (4,883) with a 92.2% accuracy, while he also won possession more often than anyone else (432). He even found time to score eight goals and provide seven assists. Rodri recovered the ball and initiated eight open-play sequences that ended in goals in the Premier League in 2023 – the most of any player. He lines up in our midfield alongside Jude Bellingham, who has taken La Liga by storm since his big-money move from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid last summer. The main eye-opener from Bellingham has been his proficiency in front of goal, scoring 22 times in all competitions in 2023, more than any other midfield nominee. But crucially, he also does the dirty work. Only eight nominees attempted more tackles than his 68, none of whom could match his success rate of 64.7%, while only eight made more interceptions than his 35. Bellingham scored 10 goals in his first 10 games in La Liga, the fewest appearances needed by a Real Madrid player to hit 10 goals in the competition this century. The final spot sees another Bayer Leverkusen player sneak in, with Florian Wirtz returning from long-term injury to dominate the Bundesliga in 2023. He assisted more goals (13) and created more chances (69) from open play than any other player in the Bundesliga in the calendar year. The 20-year-old scored 12 goals and assisted another 20 in all competitions from 48 appearances (39 starts) for Xabi Alonso’s side, with only Dortmund’s Julian Brandt able to match his 116 chances created in that time of the midfield nominees. The same duo led the way for big chances created (23), but notably for Wirtz, he also won possession in the final third more often than anyone else (52). He completed 94 dribbles in the Bundesliga in 2023, with only Bayern’s Leroy Sané completing more (114). This is the one area of the pitch where we have compromised our desire to have a balanced lineup. It was just impossible to leave either of our number nine selections out. Cristiano Ronaldo took to life in Saudi Arabia well, scoring 44 goals for Al Nassr across all competitions in 2023 – the most by any player for a Saudi Pro League club in this period. He (10) was also one of only three players to score 10+ goals for a European nation at international level in 2023, along with Kylian Mbappé (10) and Romelu Lukaku (15). The Portugal star has not made the cut, though. Did Lionel Messi? Well, he did last year, and he averaged a goal or assist every 66 minutes on average for Inter Miami in 2023 – the best ratio of any player to play 1,000+ minutes across all competitions for a Major League Soccer club. But alas, we’re afraid Messi is also not in this year’s TOTY. Erling Haaland is. He was a monster in 2023, scoring 44 goals for Man City in 54 games, assisting a further 11 and, like Rodri, winning more silverware than anyone could know what to do with. He converted more big chances than any of his fellow nominees (39), though that was aided by having 33 more than anyone else (93, ahead of Kylian Mbappé’s 60). Haaland also scored more goals (12) and was directly involved in more (14, two assists) than any other player in the Champions League in 2023. Harry Kane slots in next to the Norwegian. He was just one goal behind Haaland with 43, though that came from just 48 games with both Tottenham and Bayern. Kane also scored nine goals in nine games for England across all competitions in 2023, more than twice as many as any other player for the Three Lions. Only Stuttgart striker Serhou Guirassy (27.6%) had a better shot conversion rate out of the attacking nominees, with Kane scoring from 26.7% of his attempts at goal. The likes of Mohamed Salah, Antoine Griezmann and Lautaro Martínez were under consideration, but it is Kylian Mbappé who takes the final spot in our attack. The Paris Saint-Germain star’s future is the topic of much debate right now, but it is his recent past we’re interested in, and he had a terrific 2023. Mbappé scored 42 goals in 44 club games, with 27 goals from open play in Ligue 1 in 2023 – the highest tally of any player across Europe’s big five leagues – while he also shone on the international stage. For France in 2023, Mbappé scored more goals (10) and made more assists (6) than any other player for Les Bleus. So, that’s our XI taken from the 86-man EA Sports FC 24 Team of the Year shortlist. It’s time for you to pick yours. Voting is open from now until 11:59 PST on January 14, 2024, and you can make your TOTY selection at EA.com. Enjoy this?

With the January transfer window open and many Premier League clubs needing to strengthen, he’s given us five transfers that we should expect to happen this month. Here we go… Fabrizio says: Negotiations are at an advanced stage for a fee of €25 million plus add-ons, but Genoa want €30m and Bayern Munich are also interested in case Spurs deal won’t be closed soon. But Dragusin already agreed on personal terms with Tottenham and they remain favourites. Spurs want him as they’ve been scouting the defender for a long time. In my opinion, he’s a very good and underrated centre back; he did fantastically for Genoa and can have a similar impact as [Guglielmo] Vicario had at Tottenham. The data says: Dragusin is playing for a newly promoted Serie A side that naturally aren’t able to dominate the ball like his prospective new employers do under Ange Postecoglou, but having helped Genoa out of Serie B last season, he has experience playing in a possession-dominant team, too. The 21-year-old ranked third in Serie B in 2022-23 for successful passes (1,641) and fifth for carries of more than five metres that he followed with a pass (370). Right-footed but deployed on the left side of a back three, Dragusin is a technically competent defender who is comfortable and effective bringing the ball out of defence. This season, with Genoa having adapted to life in the top tier by playing a more reactive style of football – they rank 19th of 20 teams for average possession share (42.1%) – Dragusin hasn’t been able to show off his passing ability anything like as much. He has, however, still completed at least 57 more passes (568) than any other Genoa player, showing that when they do play out, they tend to go through him. He has had to do more defending in the top flight, and he has responded well. In 2023-24, he ranks second in Serie A for clearances made (87) and top of all defenders – and third overall – for aerial duels won (59). He has also only been dribbled past once despite playing every single available minute of league football so far this season. Spurs need reinforcements at centre-back and Dragusin looks like he could be a very good addition. Fabrizio says: Brighton and Boca Juniors are closing in on the deal. If they can’t agree on the fee, Brighton will trigger his $10m release clause as Barco only wants to join Brighton. The agreement is almost done and is only a matter of time. In my opinion, once again an excellent move by Brighton; he’s talented, fast, huge potential for the future, though it can take some time to adapt to European football. Brighton’s recruitment staff are always fast and smart. The data says: Still only 19 years old, there’s no doubt that Barco is talented, but he’s also versatile. Across the Argentina Primera División last season, he split his minutes between left-back (29% of minutes), left midfield (25%), left wing (27%) and even played 18% of his minutes in either a central midfield or defensive midfield role at Boca Juniors. Overall, only 12 players played more minutes as a teenager in the Argentinian top flight last season than Barco (1,432) while he was the second youngest outfielder in Argentina’s squad at the 2023 Under-20 World Cup, where he played in all four of their games. In league competition for Boca in 2023, his average of 1.3 chances created per 90 minutes was the third highest at the club, as was his expected assists average of 0.14. Whilst Pervis Estupiñán has the left-back position at Brighton locked down after an impressive 18 months at the Seagulls, Barco is a perfect player to eventually force his way into the side and an ideal option if the Ecuadorian spends more time out injured in 2024. Fabrizio says: It’s not something advanced yet, but Newcastle have been considering a move for Phillips since December. He’s one of the names they have on their list. Newcastle need to replace [Sandro] Tonali, while Phillips wants to play more as it’s important also to get enough game time to go to Euro 2024. Juventus were keen on Phillips but now the deal is almost off. In my opinion, it would be a very good call from Newcastle; Phillips can have an instant impact, knows Premier League football well and he’s really hungry. A crucial point. The data says: Things haven’t worked out for Phillips at Man City. Since signing from Leeds United in the summer of 2022, the midfielder has played in just 31 of his sides’ 92 competitive matches, while he’s been on the pitch for just 913 minutes overall – an average of 29 minutes per appearance. Even manager Pep Guardiola admitted that he felt sorry for the predicament that Phillips had found himself in, saying that “the only thing I can say about him is I am asking for good personalities and characters and he is a perfect example. And after that I have to give him something and I didn’t do that”. With Newcastle’s downturn in form coupled with a long injury list, Eddie Howe will need a character of Phillip’s ilk to help bond his squad. A great ball-winner, Phillips recovered possession 10.2 times per 90 minutes on average in his final Premier League season at Leeds in 2021-22, which was higher than any other player in the competition with at least 900 minutes of playing time. Newcastle’s leading possession-winner in midfield within the Premier League this season is Bruno Guimarães, who’s averaged 6.3/90, so Phillips’ could provide the team with more solid foundations in central areas. Fabrizio says: The Dutchman is one of the main names on West Ham’s list for the January window. The deal depends on outgoings, as West Ham need to sell players before bringing in new ones. Bergwijn is keen on the move, so it will depend on the budget for West Ham. In my opinion he can be a good addition for [David] Moyes’ idea of football. He’s a fast player who really wants to return to Premier League football as soon as possible. But he will need to perform on a more consistent basis if he wants to make an impact. The data says: Bergwijn’s previous foray as a Premier League footballer didn’t really live up to expectations, but it would be stupid to write him off ahead of a potential move back to London with West Ham United this month. In two and a half seasons as a Tottenham player, the Dutch forward scored just eight times in 3,560 competitive minutes, with seven more assists to his name. Of course, he’s fondly remembered at Spurs for two goals deep into injury time away at Leicester City in January 2022 to seal one of the most dramatic turnaround wins in Premier League history, but he’ll need to show more of the form he’s displayed in the last 18 months at Ajax to impress the naysayers. Since rejoining the Dutch giants in July 2022, Bergwijn has had a hand in 33 goals in 65 competitive appearances (24 goals, nine assists), with only Dusan Tadic and Brian Brobbey (both 34) been involved in more goals for Ajax since the start of 2022-23. His 16 goals across all competitions last season was a career-best campaign, while he’s scored seven goals and assisted two more in 13 Eredivisie matches this season in what has been a miserable one for his club. Despite his better goal tally, Bergwijn converted a higher proportion of chances in the Premier League with Spurs (16.3%) than he has in the Eredivisie at Ajax since (15.1%), so that suggests that if he’s given playing time at the Hammers, it could be a great deal for Moyes’ side. Fabrizio says: Done deal. Medical tests have been booked and Werner immediately accepted Spurs’ proposal on loan with €18/20m buy option clause (not mandatory). It’s Spurs deciding in the summer what they want to do with Werner, while they will cover his salary until June. In my opinion it’s a win-win situation: Werner wants to play and help, Spurs needed a cheap option, he can be ideal for Postecoglou’s “fluid” football. A quick player who loves to run in the spaces, I think he can be helpful for the north London side. The data says: Werner is known in England as a striker who misses too many chances for good reason. During his two seasons at Chelsea – 2020-21 and 2021-22 – Werner underperformed in front of goal to a greater extent than any other Premier League player. He scored 10 goals from chances worth 18.3 expected goals (xG), with his underperformance of 8.3 the worst record in the top flight in that time. A lack of confidence appeared to play a big part in Werner’s struggles in England, so it will be interesting to see how he contends with a move back to the Premier League and the scrutiny that will come with that. His numbers from his 18 months back in Germany with RB Leipzig aren’t exactly groundbreaking but his finishing at least looked to have improved to around an average level, with Werner scoring 11 goals from 11.4 xG. Wherever he has gone, the German has got into good goalscoring positions – during his two years in England, he averaged 0.42 non-penalty xG per 90, which was the 10th-highest total among Premier League players to play at least 2,500 minutes. Back in Germany, he has continued to work good opportunities, generating chances worth 0.44 xG per 90 – the seventh-highest such rate (min. 2,000 minutes played). The question, then, is whether he can replicate his Bundesliga numbers in England, or if he just isn’t suited or cut out to play in the Premier League. Much of that will boil down to the work of Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou, and how well he can build his new forward’s confidence. Enjoy this?

They scored 88 goals in the Premier League last season, though, so could the answer be closer to home? Sunday felt like it summed up Arsenal’s recent struggles. Their FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool saw them create plenty of chances, press well, force mistakes and do almost everything right, except putting the round thing into the rectangular thing. As a result, Mikel Arteta’s men lost 2-0 and another opportunity to secure silverware was waved off into the distance. It was the latest in a recent run of games that has seen Arsenal struggle to find the net and pay the price for it. Their cup defeat to Liverpool made it consecutive home losses by a margin of 2+ goals for the first time since May 2009 (3-1 vs Manchester United, 4-1 vs Chelsea), having also been beaten 2-0 by West Ham in the Premier League on 28 December. It made it one win in seven in all competitions for Arsenal – their fewest wins over a seven-game period under Arteta – and three defeats on the bounce, having also lost 2-1 at Fulham on New Year’s Eve. In fact, across those three games, Arsenal have scored just one goal from 61 shots, and a total expected goals (xG) value of 6.0, meaning they scored five fewer goals than they should have based on the quality of the opportunities created. Therefore, the predictable shouts from pundits and Arsenal fans alike at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday was for the club to sign a striker. Ivan Toney, Dominic Solanke, bring Ian Wright out of retirement; the number of (not entirely serious) solutions that involve new faces being brought to north London are almost endless. When told that the fans had been demanding a new striker during the game, Arteta said in his post-match press conference: “At the moment it does not look realistic. What my job is, and what we have to do is improve our players and try to get better results with the players we have. “What I beg from the supporters is that they are behind the team like they have been in difficult moments.” And as disheartening as it might be for Arsenal fans who want to see a shiny new striker arrive in the January transfer window, Arteta is right. His job is to improve the players he has, the same ones who collectively scored 88 goals in the Premier League last season, 13 more than the third most (Liverpool) and only six fewer than champions Manchester City, who had Erling Haaland. While Toney or Solanke might add goals, it’s a bit too easy to assume Arsenal will otherwise keep playing exactly the same way and creating the number of chances they are now if they were to add a different type of striker. We observed in November that Arsenal had become a little less extravagant going forward but a little more robust overall, though that has deserted them somewhat in recent games. As well as scoring just once from 61 attempts since Christmas, they have conceded six times from 33 shots faced and an overall xG against of 3.3. From an attacking sense, it could simply be that Arsenal have reverted to the mean. Last season in the Premier League they scored their 88 goals from an xG of 72.3, scoring about 16 goals more than they should have. This season they have scored 37 from an xG of 37.2, almost exactly what they should have. If you just look at non-penalty goals, though, things do look a bit more concerning. Arsenal have already scored twice as many penalties in the Premier League this season (six) as they did in the whole of last season (three), meaning they have scored just 31 non-penalty goals in their 20 games. That’s an average of 1.55 non-penalty goals per game, compared to last season’s 2.24. Arsenal’s chance creation hasn’t really been impacted, though. In fact, they are averaging slightly more shots per game this season (16.3) in the league than they did last season (15.6), and their average xG per game is only very narrowly lower (1.86) than last season (1.9). So it’s not as if they are creating significantly lower quality chances, they just simply aren’t converting them as often. We looked only last week at how giving Bukayo Saka a rest could be a solution for the Arsenal boss, though yet again it was the England man who started against Liverpool and Gabriel Martinelli was the one who dropped to the bench, with Reiss Nelson coming in. Arteta was able to rely on both Saka and Martinelli regularly finding the net last season, scoring 14 and 15 Premier League goals respectively, while Martin Ødegaard also hit 15. All three have seen their efficiency in front of goal reduce considerably in 2023-24, though. Saka’s 14 league goals in 2022-23 came with a conversion rate of 15.7%, while he scored seven of his 10 big chances (70%). This season, Saka has a conversion rate of 12.2%, and though he has already had more big chances than he did in the whole of last season (11), he has only scored four (36.4%). Martinelli’s drop is far greater, going from a 19% shot conversion rate last season in the Premier League to 6.1% this, scoring just twice from 33 shots, and he has only had three big chances (scoring one), having had 16 last season (scoring 10). Ødegaard has slipped from a 16.1% conversion rate to just 10.3% but has scored two of his three big chances. Leandro Trossard was an interesting addition from Brighton last January, and he provided an outstanding 10 assists in the second half of the 2022-23 Premier League season, though he scored just once from 17 shots. The Belgian wide forward has three league goals this season, but just one assist. Whether that is down to a change in Trossard’s game or just a result of poor finishing from his teammates is up for debate, but he is another attacking player whose output has noticeably dipped. The main debate seems to be around the central strikers, however. Gabriel Jesus was hailed as an important addition when he arrived from Man City in the summer of 2022, and his impact last season was impressive. He scored 11 league goals in 26 games and had a respectable shot conversion rate of 14.3%, while he had the highest xG of all of Arsenal’s forwards (14) and also produced six assists. This season he’s converted just 9.4% of his shots, with three goals in 15 games from an xG of 4.84. After allowing Folarin Balogun to leave for Monaco in the summer, Eddie Nketiah is probably the closest Arsenal have to the out-and-out goalscoring number nine the fans are clamouring for, but he had a conversion rate of just 9.8% in the Premier League last season, and put away only four of his 15 big chances (26.7%). He’s actually upped his overall conversion rate to 15.6% this season and scored three of his seven big chances (42.9%). Arteta started Nketiah in nine of Arsenal’s first 11 Premier League games this season but has given him just one start since Jesus returned, which was last time out in the defeat at Fulham. That may be primarily due to Jesus being more creative than Nketiah last season, with the Brazilian averaging 1.35 chances created per 90 minutes compared to Nketiah’s 0.76. That gap has widened this season, with Jesus creating 1.63 chances per 90 to Nketiah’s 0.65. Kai Havertz’s numbers are skewed by the fact he has played several games in midfield since arriving from Chelsea, but he has scored just four goals from 19 Premier League games and is the only attacking player to start in the league this season and average under two shots per 90 (1.92). The Germany international tried to impose himself when he started up front against Liverpool on Sunday, having six shots, the most by an Arsenal player in an FA Cup game without scoring since Olivier Giroud against Hull City in the 2014 final (six). Havertz hit the target with only two of them, though, while he completed 12 of just 18 passes and won only two of 14 duels contested. Having said that, Nketiah came on in the 81st minute and had just one touch of the ball. In fact, of every Arsenal player to have featured in at least five Premier League games this season, no-one has averaged as few touches per 90 as Nketiah’s 32.7. He’s the only outfield player to average fewer touches than goalkeeping pair David Raya (37.6) and Aaron Ramsdale (32.8). Let’s compare with Ivan Toney’s Premier League numbers from last season. The Brentford striker scored 20 goals in 33 games, six of which were penalties, with an overall shot conversion rate of 21.3%, averaging 41 touches per 90 (of Arsenal forwards only Nketiah has averaged fewer this season), while also scoring 17 of his 33 big chances (51.5%). You can therefore understand why there is such a clamour for someone of his profile at Arsenal. When it feels like nothing will go in for you, the natural reaction is to look to someone who has history of putting away a healthy amount of his chances. It does seem like having a striker of that type would require a compromise elsewhere, though, especially given how different Brentford play to Arsenal. Looking at last season’s stats in the Premier League off the ball, Jesus averaged 1.5 tackles per 90, more than twice as many as Toney’s 0.7, while the former Man City man made 13 pressures in the final third per 90 (Toney 9.6) 2.7 pressures in the final third resulting in a turnover per 90 (Toney 1.8), and 1.2 pressures in a team press resulting in a turnover per 90 (Toney 0.6). That’s not to say Toney couldn’t adapt, but doing so could also impact on his output in front of goal. Arsenal would also have the issue of finding the significant money it would take to pry Toney from the Gtech Community Stadium, which would likely be the case for any other striker of the required level in the January transfer window. Arteta is right that he needs to solve this issue himself. That’s what the best managers do, and while it’s easier said than done, the fact of the matter is that he has a group of players available to him who scored more than enough goals only last season. Find a way to get the likes of Saka, Martinelli and Ødegaard firing again, and all of a sudden, sticking with what he knows makes a lot more sense. Enjoy this?

We look ahead to this EFL Cup semi-final first leg with our Middlesbrough vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Championship side Middlesbrough will face their sternest League Cup test so far this season when they welcome Premier League side Chelsea to the Riverside Stadium on Tuesday night. Michael Carrick’s men have progressed to their first EFL Cup semi-final since the 2003-04 campaign, but have yet to face top-flight opposition in this year’s competition. That said, Boro’s impressive run has seen them play five consecutive away matches in their route to the semi-finals, scoring at least two goals in every game in victories against Huddersfield Town, Bolton Wanderers, Bradford City, Exeter City and Port Vale.  One of the casualties from that win against Port Vale is Middlesbrough’s EFL Cup top scorer, Morgan Rogers. He scored in their 3-0 quarter-final win but also picked up a booking,  meaning he’ll have to serve a one-game ban for the first leg. Rogers has thrived in the competition this term, scoring in each of his last four such matches, also providing two assists in this run. The last player to score more than Rogers’ four in a single EFL Cup campaign for the club was Fabrizio Ravanelli in 1996-97 (nine).  Boro come into this tie on the back of consecutive defeats, but ran another Premier League side, Aston Villa, close in their FA Cup third round tie at the weekend. Carrick’s men held out for 87 minutes before a deflected strike from Matty Cash ultimately sealed their fate. On the whole it was a solid display from the home side who restricted Villa to just 0.75 expected goals – their fifth-lowest total in a game so far this season in all competitions. They can also take heart from the fact that they’ve progressed from each of their last three semi-final ties in the competition, in 1996-97, 1997-98 and in their last outing in 2003-04, where they beat Arsenal on the way to winning the whole competition.  Chelsea’s 4-0 FA Cup win over Preston North End at the weekend was their third consecutive victory in all competitions. Armando Broja and Thiago Silva both scored headers, while Raheem Sterling curled in a free-kick and Enzo Fernández added a late fourth. After registering 2-1 and 3-2 wins over Crystal Palace and Luton Town respectively, it feels like the Blues are starting to find their groove under Mauricio Pochettino.  Speaking of the Chelsea boss, Pochettino has never lost against lower division opposition in the EFL Cup (W9 D2), though one of those two draws did result in a penalty shootout elimination (against Colchester United in September 2019 with Spurs). For their part, Chelsea have won each of their last 15 EFL Cup matches against sides from a lower division, scoring 53 goals in the process. The Blues have had the luxury of home draws in their EFL run, knocking out AFC Wimbledon, Brighton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United all from the comfort of Stamford Bridge. In team news, Chelsea will be without Nicolas Jackson due to his AFCON call up, while Christopher Nkunku also misses out after being absent from the win over Preston with a hip injury. Full-backs Reece James and Marc Cucurella remain out, as do Robert Sanchez, Trevoh Chalobah and Roméo\\xa0Lavia. Michael Carrick will be without the suspended Rogers, cup-tied pair Finn Azaz and Sam Greenwood, and he’s lost Samuel Silvera and Riley McGree on international duty to the Asian Cup and Seny Dieng to the Africa Cup of Nations.  This has been a hugely one-sided encounter in recent memory. Chelsea have won their last nine meetings with Middlesbrough in all competitions by an aggregate score of 21-0. In English football history, only Liverpool have won more consecutive games against an opponent while keeping a clean sheet each time (10 vs West Bromwich Albion between 1997 and 2010). This will be the fourth EFL Cup meeting between Middlesbrough (one win) and Chelsea (two wins), with all coming with Chelsea as a top-flight club and Middlesbrough in the second tier. This is the first such meeting since the 1998 final, and a 2-0 win for the Blues at Wembley. The two sides’ most recent encounter came in an FA Cup quarter-final in 2022. Chelsea prevailed 2-0 that day thanks to goals from Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech.  Middlesbrough have scored at least twice in all five of their EFL Cup games so far this season, netting three goals in four of those. However, this will be their only home match in the competition this term and that may be cause for concern. The Riverside Stadium has been anything but a fortress recently, with Boro losing four of their last five home matches, conceding eight times across that spell.  Chelsea come into this off the back of three straight victories in all competitions, netting at least twice in all of those. Given their stuttering league campaign to date, expect them to go full strength here as winning the EFL Cup could be their likeliest route into Europe this season.  The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Chelsea can take a huge step towards the Carabao Cup final with a win over Middlesbrough here. They are favourites to take a lead back to Stamford Bridge for the second leg, with the Blues winning 59.6% of the Opta supercomputer’s simulations of this tie.  As they proved against Aston Villa, though, Boro are capable of going toe-to-toe with Premier League opposition, and they have a 19.5% chance of springing an upset. The draw – which you feel both sides wouldn’t particularly mind – comes in at 20.8%.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to this meeting with our Arsenal vs Liverpool prediction and preview. The pick of the FA Cup third round ties this weekend sees Arsenal and Liverpool do battle at the Emirates Stadium. With 22 FA Cup trophies between them, the pair are two of the most successful clubs in the competition’s history, and have faced off against each other 17 times, including three finals. Such is their history down the years that only Manchester United (10) have eliminated Liverpool from the FA Cup more often than Arsenal (8), and similarly only the Red Devils (8) have knocked the Gunners out of the cup more often than Liverpool (5). Fresh off the back of their remarkable 4-2 win against Newcastle, it’s Liverpool who come into this contest sitting top of the Premier League pile. Jürgen\\xa0Klopp’s men enjoyed a fruitful festive season, winning twice and drawing to Sunday’s opponents Arsenal. Seven points from a possible nine saw their chances of winning the league rise from 22.4% to 34.6%, and they are the form team in the English top flight. Aside from an away defeat in their final Europa League group stage match – a game that was essentially a dead rubber – Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 11 matches in all competitions (W7 D4).  They didn’t get through the hectic schedule unscathed though, with Dominik Szoboszlai and Kostas Tsimikas picking up serious-looking injuries, while of course they will be without key players Mohamed Salah and Wataru Endo as the pair head off on international duty to the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup. Caoimhin Kelleher has been Liverpool’s regular cup keeper in recent seasons, but given the difficulty of this fixture, the fact we’re about to enter the winter break and the assumption that the Irishman will play against Fulham three days after this game in Liverpool’s Carabao\\xa0Cup semi-final against Fulham means Alisson could well start this one. Dominik Szoboszlai is surely out of contention – alongside Thiago and Stefan Bajcetic – but Alexis Mac Allister should come in as Klopp’s deepest-lying midfielder, having made his comeback from injury in the win over Newcastle. If Liverpool had a productive Christmas period, then it was the complete opposite for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, who were arguably the biggest losers across the three matchdays played across 13 hectic days from late December to the new year. The Gunners picked up just one point in this period – a 1-1 with Liverpool in what was their hardest fixture – before poor performances saw them lose against West Ham and Fulham.  This damaging run saw their chances of winning the title drop by 24.2% \\xad\\xad– a bigger drop than any other team in any specific position in the Premier League. In Arsenal team news, Mikel Arteta will be without Egyptian midfielder Mohamed Elneny and Japanese full-back Takehiro Tomiyasu due to their international commitments, while Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Thomas Partey and Jurrien Timber are out with injury. Gabriel Jesus could return to the starting XI after coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 loss to Fulham.  Earlier this week, we mooted whether Arteta would finally rest Bukayo Saka, who has looked jaded in recent months and in desperate need of a break. Knowing the Spaniard, and his demands and expectations of his star winger, there’s little chance of that happening.  Arsenal’s 3-2 home win against Liverpool in the Premier League last season is their only victory in their last 11 meetings with the Reds in all competitions (D5 L5). In the FA Cup, however, it is the Gunners who usually come out on top. There have been 17 meetings in total down the years, and Arsenal have lost just five of those inside 90 minutes.  Since losing the 2001 final in Cardiff, Arsenal have won their last three FA Cup meetings with Liverpool, beating them 1-0 at Highbury in 2001-02, 3-1 at Anfield in 2006-07 and 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium in 2013-14. While Arsenal’s league form has been turbulent of late, their FA Cup pedigree – particularly at home – is exceptional. They’ve lost just three of their last 49 FA Cup home games (W36 D10), going down 1-0 against Blackburn Rovers in 2012-13, 2-1 against Watford in 2015-16 and 3-1 against Man Utd in 2018-19. Liverpool have only been eliminated from the FA Cup at this stage in one of the last 12 seasons, going down 2-1 at Wolves in 2018-19. Something’s got to give.  The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite their recent woes, the Opta supercomputer makes Arsenal the favourites for this fixture, giving them a 46.3% chance of beating Liverpool on Sunday.  It’s a good time to face Arsenal, though, and the Reds will fancy their chances.  Our model has them winning 29.2% of the 10,000 data-powered simulations of this tie. The draw comes in at 24.6%.

We look at potential solutions for the Premier League leaders. Liverpool are top of the Premier League, through to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and into the knockout stage of the UEFA Europa League. The sun is shining and the birds are singing at Anfield, and the only thing to bring the mood down is the sound of the plane whisking Mohamed Salah off to the Africa Cup of Nations. Jürgen Klopp is preparing to spend the next few weeks without his star player as Salah targets revenge and AFCON glory. In 2022, Salah and the Pharaohs agonisingly lost on penalties to Senegal in the final and will be keen to rectify that in Ivory Coast. How much will Liverpool miss Salah, though? Well, he has 14 goals and eight assists in 20 Premier League games this season, meaning he has either scored or assisted more than half of Liverpool’s 43 league goals. He has an additional four goals in other competitions. Salah further proved his importance to the team with an outstanding second-half showing in Monday’s win over Newcastle United, when Liverpool accumulated the highest xG total on record in a Premier League game. The Egyptian walked away with two goals and an assist and could have had a hat-trick had he not seen a first-half penalty saved by Martin Dúbravka. It’s not just his output; Salah is simply always there. Since his first start after returning from AFCON two years ago – a 1-0 win at Burnley – Salah has played in 72 of Liverpool’s 73 Premier League games, starting 67. Two years ago, the same questions were being asked about Liverpool’s ability to manage without Salah during AFCON. The concern was doubled with Sadio Mané also absent during his final season at the club, but ultimately Klopp and his remaining players managed just fine. They played six games without Salah in all competitions, only failing to win their EFL Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal when they drew 0-0 at Anfield, before winning the second leg 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium. They beat Shrewsbury Town and Cardiff City in the FA Cup, while sealing Premier League victories at home to Brentford and away to Crystal Palace. Salah returned from the bench in a 2-0 win over Leicester City in which Diogo Jota hit both goals. This time, Salah could miss up to seven games, with the AFCON final taking place on 11 February, one day after Liverpool host Burnley in the Premier League. That run of fixtures includes Sunday’s FA Cup third round trip to Arsenal, both legs of their EFL Cup semi-final against Fulham and league games against Bournemouth (away), Chelsea (home), Arsenal (away) and the Clarets, as well as the FA Cup fourth round should Liverpool get past the Gunners. If Liverpool – who will also be without Wataru Endo due to his involvement in the Asian Cup – get lucky (and Salah doesn’t) and Egypt go out in the group stage, he could be back for the Chelsea clash at the end of the month, but Klopp must plan to have him out for the duration.  So, what are his options? As things stand, this seems like the most natural solution. Due to Salah’s importance to the team and astonishing ability to stay fit, Liverpool have never really looked to sign a like-for-like back-up for him. The closest thing they have is Elliott, who himself has had to readjust to more of a midfield role due to the fact he hasn’t been able to get a look in on the right of the attack. Like Salah – and unlike any other senior Liverpool player who isn’t a left-back – Elliott is left footed and so would naturally bring that same balance to the attack, having a left-sided player who can drift in. He showed that to great effect with his recent goal at Crystal Palace. A stunning late winner from our 💎 pic.twitter.com/Ysx36p8IYV He also showed his improved finishing ability in the 2-0 win at Burnley on Boxing Day with a nice first-time effort into the bottom corner, though it was ruled out due to Salah being in an offside position. Elliott has predominantly been a substitute in the Premier League this season, starting just twice and making a further 14 appearances off the bench, but he has started 11 games overall. In fact, he has started every Europa League and EFL Cup game and his numbers have hinted at an improvement in productivity. Elliott has just one goal and one assist from his 25 appearances this season, but only Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ryan Gravenberch and Diogo Jota have averaged more chances created from open play per 90 minutes for Liverpool than his 1.75. On top of that, only Dominik Szoboszlai (7.3) is averaging more attacking sequence involvements per 90 than the 20-year-old (7.0) for Liverpool. The former Fulham youngster also started on the right of the attack in Liverpool’s 5-1 demolition of West Ham in the EFL Cup quarter-finals, arguably the most fluent attacking performance from Klopp’s men this season, at least prior to the Newcastle game. Speaking of youngsters, Ben Doak is out injured but Klopp could look to Kaide Gordon, who surprisingly started for Liverpool away at Arsenal in their EFL Cup semi-final second leg two years ago and also featured in other games, scoring against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup. The 19-year-old has been injured for most of the time since then, though, only recently making another first team appearance in the Europa League group stage dead rubber at Union Saint-Gilloise. Gordon could make an appearance in one of the cup games but it would be a big ask to bring him into Premier League action after so long out. This could be an option that is taken off the table before Klopp has a chance to consider it. Szoboszlai came off holding his hamstring in the win over Newcastle, and Klopp confirmed on Friday that he will at the very least miss the FA Cup clash with Arsenal and the EFL Cup semi-final first leg against Fulham. However, if he returns after that then the Hungarian could be a serious possibility to fill in for Salah. Szoboszlai has played in midfield since arriving from RB Leipzig in the summer, predominantly on the right of a three and just to the left of Salah. However, he mostly featured on the right of the attack for Leipzig last season, albeit in a different formation. It would take some adjustment for him and for Liverpool having a right-footed player out there. His first Premier League goal against Aston Villa earlier this season showed he can use his left, but he certainly prefers his right. Szoboszlai could potentially play the role similarly to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain when he filled in for Salah two years ago. Oxlade-Chamberlain – now at Besiktas – scored against both Brentford and Palace when he stepped up, and Szoboszlai has shown he can also find the net, having done so four times in all competitions this season. As mentioned, he is averaging the most attacking sequence involvements per 90 for his new team, while only Salah (83) and Darwin Núñez (80) have attempted more shots. On paper, Liverpool have a plethora of other forward options. So, you would think Klopp would just move one of them over to the right. Well, probably not. None of Jota, Cody Gakpo, Luis Díaz or Núñez have much, if any, history of playing on the right. Obviously, Salah has had the position locked down in recent years, but even when looking at the position map for each of them in their last full season before joining Liverpool, only Gakpo played any time at all on the right of the attack, and that was for just 4% of PSV’s 2021-22 Eredivisie campaign. All of them are also right footed, and on the rare occasions the likes of Díaz and Jota have played out there for Liverpool, they haven’t looked particularly comfortable. The latter could possibly adjust to it as he is proficient with both feet, but Klopp would probably be taking his next best finisher away from positions where he’s likely to score. Of Jota’s 36 Premier League goals since joining Liverpool, 11 have been with his left foot and 17 with his right, while only one of those goals came from a position outside the right-hand post. However, positionally is not the only way they can help to replace Salah. It seems unlikely that Elliott or Szoboszlai would entirely replace the Egyptian’s goals, and so others will need to step up and find the net more often. Jota is Liverpool’s second-top scorer in all competitions with nine goals and actually has the best shot conversion of anyone at the club (25.7%) this season. He has also scored five of his eight big chances (62.5%), so seems the likeliest candidate to give Liverpool the goals they will undoubtedly miss from Salah, who has a shot conversion of 21.7% (18 goals from 83 shots) and scored 15 of his 26 big chances (57.7%). Núñez is continuing to hint at producing a glut of goals but needs to improve his finishing as the Uruguayan is getting almost as many chances as Salah. However, he has scored just eight times from 80 shots (10% conversion rate) and has found the net from only five of his 29 big chances (17.2%). He is a provider though, matching Salah and Alexander-Arnold with eight assists, but only one of those has been for a player other than Salah, when he gave Szoboszlai the pass to score at Sheffield United. Gakpo (eight goals from 45 shots – 17.8%) and Díaz (five goals from 40 shots – 12.5%) could also get more involved given the likely change of attacking emphasis which, up until now, has largely been to get the ball to Salah. It wouldn’t be a Liverpool article without suggesting Klopp does something a bit mad with Trent Alexander-Arnold. This is very much an outside shout as it’s unlikely the manager would move him, not least because the England international is thriving at right-back with a licence to drift into midfield. Also, with Andrew Robertson and Kostas Tsimikas out injured Klopp is having to play his back-up right-back, Joe Gomez, on the left for the time being. However, in theory, you can see a world where pushing Alexander-Arnold further up the pitch might work. Only four players have created more chances in the Premier League this season than his 49, while for Liverpool in all competitions, only Salah (52) has created more chances from open play than his 38. Only Salah, Gakpo, Szoboszlai, Díaz, Núñez and Elliott have attempted more shots than his 35. Then you have the fact that, after Salah, Alexander-Arnold is probably the Liverpool player who gives opposition players the most pre-game butterflies. The amount of attention defenders would need to give him to keep him quiet would likely lead to extra space for others, as Salah’s presence so often does. Alexander-Arnold is getting into more threatening attacking areas now that he is able to maraud into midfield, but he could get closer still if he was starting on the right of the attack, while his world-class crossing ability could be put to use even more if his teammates can regularly find him out there. It would undoubtedly take away from the space he has to work in, though, and therefore, likely impact his influence on games. As you can see from the respective touch zones, Alexander-Arnold is able to use much more of the pitch where he is now compared to Salah, who so often works in very tight spaces. Then again, if Alexander-Arnold is in those positions, it might give Liverpool’s vice-captain more opportunities to attempt ludicrous things like the below effort against Newcastle. Still thinking about if this had of gone in 😮\\u200d💨 pic.twitter.com/2OvtGr4qGJ Whatever Klopp decides to do, he will hope he can have as much joy during this Salah-less period as he did two years ago.

Wataru Endo’s first start for Liverpool was a difficult task to say the least. The Japan international had featured for 28 minutes off the bench in the 3-1 win over Bournemouth a week earlier and lined up at St James’ Park for Liverpool’s trip to Newcastle United. Within half an hour, Endo was part of a team that was 1-0 down and playing with 10 men after captain Virgil van Dijk had been sent off. He didn’t disgrace himself but looked a bit overawed by the speed of the game around him. He was replaced by Harvey Elliott before the hour and watched from the bench as super sub Darwin Núñez rifled in a late brace to turn things around for the visitors. Just over four months later, Endo started again in the reverse fixture at Anfield. With 11 men on the pitch for the duration, Liverpool dominated Newcastle with Endo looking at ease, calm and composed as he helped to pull the strings. Jürgen Klopp’s men racked up 7.11 expected goals in their 4-2 win, the highest xG on record (since 2010-11) from one team in a Premier League game. When Liverpool signed Endo in August, there were more than a few eyebrows raised. Many had never heard of him, and even though others who were aware of Endo’s talents spoke highly of him, there was still plenty of surprise that Liverpool deemed him worthy of the famous red shirt. Having spent the summer transfer window signing bright young midfielders as part of a long-term rebuild, and also having had a nine-figure bid for Brighton’s Moisés Caicedo prove unsuccessful after the Ecuadorian chose Chelsea, the last thing people expected Liverpool to do was to go for a 30-year-old from the Bundesliga for a reported £16 million. Unsurprisingly, Endo was eased slowly into things at Anfield. He started games here and there in the UEFA Europa League and EFL Cup, but following that first game in Newcastle, Endo didn’t start again in the Premier League until mid-November’s home win against Brentford. He was back on the bench for the 1-1 draw at Manchester City as well as the dramatic home game with Fulham, where he came on with Liverpool 3-2 down and scored a spectacular equaliser, just prior to Trent Alexander-Arnold firing in the winner in a 4-3 success. Sparking the comeback with a wonderful strike 💥Incredible impact off the bench from @wataru0209 ✊ pic.twitter.com/AnFaRkdTyP That impact saw him play the full 90 minutes of the 2-0 win at Sheffield United, where Alexis Mac Allister suffered an injury that would keep him out until the new year. That meant Endo was going to be needed during the busy festive period, and Klopp made full use of the 30-year-old. Endo went on to start five games in 13 days, becoming the first outfield player to do so for the club since January 2006. It wasn’t just out of necessity, though. He was keeping his place on merit, becoming a key part of more controlled Liverpool performances. Today is Liverpool's 5th game in 13 days – and Wataru Endo is the only player to start all 5 of those games.Endo is the first outfielder to start 5 games in 13 days for #LFC since January 2006, when Finnan, Carragher, Hyypiä, Gerrard, Kewell, and Crouch all did so. #BURLIV His showing in the 2-0 win at Burnley on Boxing Day drew particular praise from his manager, who said afterward: “I loved his game, I have to say. It’s a bit of a shame he finds his feet and now he goes to the Asian Cup.” And that’s the unfortunate thing for both Endo and Liverpool. It feels as though the player has started to figure out English football, but now will miss up to five weeks of the season while away at the AFC Asian Cup with Japan. In his final outing before heading off for the tournament in Qatar, Endo shone against Newcastle. He attempted (69) and completed (63 – 91.3%) more passes than any other Liverpool player despite playing just 75 minutes. He attempted 37 passes in the Newcastle half, completing 91.9% of them, and made three interceptions. Only Alexander-Arnold (four) made more. The difference between games with and without Endo does seem striking. Just looking at the Premier League this season, Liverpool have won six of the eight games (75%) Endo has started, but only seven of the 12 games he hasn’t (58.3%). They’ve also conceded just five goals in those eight games (0.6 per game) versus 13 in the 12 when he hasn’t started (1.1 per game). That, of course, doesn’t take into account games where he came off the bench where – as mentioned already – he has also made a difference, such as in the 4-3 victory over Fulham. In Premier League games where Endo has featured at any time, Liverpool have won 11 of 15 (73.3%), scoring 34 goals (2.3 per game) and averaging 2.4 points per game. In the five games where Endo didn’t play a single minute, Liverpool won just two (40%) and scored only nine goals (1.8 per game), averaging 1.8 points per game. When we looked at Endo in the summer following his move to Liverpool, we noted that he was particularly strong in the air. No Bundesliga midfielder won more than his 219 aerial duels during his time at Stuttgart, winning 2.2 out of 3.7 per 90 minutes. That has continued in the Premier League this season, with no Liverpool midfielder able to match his 1.9 aerial duels won per 90 (from an average of 3.6 contested). Only eight midfielders in the Premier League to have played at least 500 minutes have won more aerial duels per 90. Endo also had the most attacking sequence involvements for Stuttgart in the Bundesliga last season (129). That hasn’t been the case at Liverpool. Of Klopp’s midfielders who have played at least 180 minutes in the Premier League this season, Harvey Elliott (7.9), Dominik Szoboszlai (6.7), Curtis Jones (5.9) and Ryan Gravenberch (5.0) have all averaged more attacking sequence involvements per 90, though Endo’s 4.8 is marginally more than Mac Allister (4.7). When Liverpool signed Endo, Klopp made a point of showing gratitude that he had a midfielder whose primary mindset was to defend. The club had missed out on Caicedo, while also losing another reported target in Roméo Lavia to Chelsea. At a test event for Liverpool’s renovated Anfield Road stand in December, Klopp told the crowd: “The summer we had, we had a few strange things happen in the transfer market but here, between us, I can say, ‘My god, were we lucky, eh?’. We didn’t know that in that moment and it didn’t feel like it in that moment, but yeah, I’m really happy that it worked out…” before joking:  “We obviously realised that other central defensive midfielders don’t want to join Liverpool, you see what happens, and then we found [Wataru] Endo. He’s an exceptional player.” One of the main jobs for Endo when he arrived was to be an improvement on the outgoing Fabinho, who struggled for form last season and was ultimately sold to Al-Ittihad of the Saudi Pro League. In all competitions, Endo is ahead of the Brazilian’s numbers from last season for tackles per 90 (2.22-2.19), interceptions (1.50-1.25), possession won (6.8-5.9), possession won in the final third (0.92-0.71) and passes (64.4-60.3). He also compares similarly to Mac Allister, who is the only other player to regularly take up the deepest-lying midfield role this season. The former Brighton man and FIFA World Cup winner does have higher numbers for passes forward under pressure than Endo (5.6-2.2), suggesting he is more adventurous on the ball, but the former Stuttgart player’s tidiness and more risk-averse nature has arguably been a key part of Liverpool’s calmer performances of late. Regarding Endo, Klopp recently said: “We don’t give people time anymore… Some of the biggest players this club in my era ever saw needed time to adapt. Some others didn’t. But some big players did. “Andy Robertson didn’t play half a year, pretty much was not in the squad! And Fabinho we had to change the system for because he couldn’t play [as the] six alone [at first]. Later on he could play that easily, made it his position, so it’s all fine. “You need a bit of time, that’s all. We see [Endo] every day in training and he is one of the hardest-working people I ever met. It was always clear that it will be good, but I’m happy obviously for him the public could see it now as well, because that’s pretty helpful in our job.” Liverpool fans have gone from wondering if Endo is good enough to play for them to hoping Japan go out of the Asian Cup as early as possible. As the great Bill Shankly once said: “A football team is like a piano. You need eight men to carry it and three who can play the damn thing.” Endo will never be a figure as iconic as Alisson, Van Dijk or Mohamed Salah, but keep carrying that piano and he will justify Liverpool’s decision to take a leap of faith.

But is it time for the Arsenal star to get a break?  It’s October 2022. Arsenal are top of the Premier League, four points clear of Manchester City. Realistic Arsenal fans don’t genuinely believe their team is going to win the title, but they are still enjoying the start to the season their team has made. There are reasonable concerns, though, that any injury to a key player in what is a lightweight squad could derail their season before it has got started. So, when Bukayo Saka fell to the turf in pain following a rough challenge during Arsenal’s Europa League tie with PSV Eindhoven, there was understandable worry. With the hosts already 1-0 up with just 15 minutes remaining and only needing a point to guarantee their place in the knockout rounds after four group-stage games, many of the home fans would have wanted Saka to be withdrawn. Most probably assumed he would be. He played on for another 10 minutes, though, before eventually being withdrawn on 85 minutes. Saka hobbled off the pitch looking rather uncomfortable. Arsenal saw out a 1-0 win and guaranteed top spot with two group games to play. Arteta would have seen his decision to risk Saka as vindicated, but many thought it was one he didn’t need to take. The Arsenal manager was bullish after the game. “Look at the top players in the world, they play 70 matches, [playing] every three days and make the difference and win the game,” he said. “[If] you want to be at the top, you have to be able to do that. If we start to put something different in the minds of our young players, I think we are making a huge mistake. Then it’s one yes, one no, now I don’t play, on astroturf I don’t play, I don’t want that. “There is not a fitness coach in the world who is going to tell me that they cannot do it because I’ve seen it. Seventy-two games, score 50 goals. The players don’t score 50 goals if they play 38 games in the season, it’s impossible.” It was some statement. Nobody can question the youngster’s talent and sky-high potential, but Saka had only just turned 21 when Arteta fired this challenge his way. Saka is already one of the “top players in the world,” but was it a little early for Arteta to start demanding quite so much? More than a year on, and Arsenal are as reliant as ever on their star winger. Arteta has shown no sign of demanding any less from Saka. Well, in some sense, why should he? Saka is clearly one of the best players in the Premier League, and Arteta has done a fantastic job of developing him. The Spaniard was clearly hoping that by sending a message like the one above, he could show Saka just how highly he thought of him, and exactly how great he could become. Saka is patently good enough to one day be the kind of forward Arteta was referring to, and so much exposure to first-team football at the highest level from such a young age has been crucial to Saka becoming the player he already is. At the same time, there is an argument that continuing to play Saka through small – and, crucially, manageable – levels of pain may be detrimental to his development, not to mention his long-term health. Saka will start on the right side of attack for Arsenal whenever he is fit enough to, and also throughout any dip in form. Some might wonder if it would be helpful for Saka to have the odd rest. His strike in the defeat at Fulham on Sunday was his first goal or assist in five games – a run that has seen Arsenal lose three times and draw once. It wasn’t exactly a terrible drought, but it was by a distance the longest he has gone without a goal contribution this season.  Saka played 90 minutes in four of those five games and 89 minutes in the other, only coming off after Arsenal had doubled their lead in the 2-0 home win over Brighton. In the busy festive period, Saka played every minute of three games in the space of nine days, from which Arsenal took only one point, drawing with Liverpool before losing to West Ham and Fulham. Only 49 outfielders played as much football as Saka over that time, and just eight of them also, like Saka, play in attack. In fact, Saka has started every Premier League game this season apart from the win over Manchester City, which he missed through injury. He finishes most games, and the earliest he has been substituted off was in the 73rd minute against Sheffield United. Saka even played 66 minutes of the Champions League demolition of Lens, which Arsenal needed to win to wrap up top spot. But given they were 5-0 up at half-time, it had by the break become a perfect opportunity to give Saka a rest. Arteta could point to one particular result without Saka as a defence for playing him so much. Saka was rested for most of the EFL Cup trip to West Ham in November, and Arsenal crashed out, losing 3-1. But Arsenal also beat City without him, and he hasn’t been at his best for a little while now. A rest could do him some good. There is no doubt that even when Saka isn’t directly contributing to goals, he still does a tonne of important work for the team. Among plenty of things, he helps to relieve pressure on the defence by carrying the ball up the pitch – only 11 players have completed more carries than him (311) this season and only two of those are other attack-minded players in Bernardo Silva (321) and Dejan Kulusevski (315) – with Arsenal always hoping to establish possession in opposition territory. Saka plays a key role in helping that happen. He ranks just outside the top 10 in the Premier League this season for successful dribbles (31) and is the third most-fouled player (43) in the division. Only Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes (54) and Newcastle’s Kieran Trippier (52) have created more chances than Saka (50), but Saka is top of the entire league for expected assists (6.53), showing that he is creating better quality chances than anyone else in the top flight. But a decent portion of his telling contributions have come at set-pieces. Arsenal have become the Premier League’s best dead-ball team, with no other side able to better their 11 set-piece goals this season (level with Everton). For comparison, title rivals Liverpool have scored only five.  Set-pieces are very important to Arteta and understandably so given how fruitful they’ve proved, and Saka’s delivery is important to that strategy. But it is also fair to say that we might expect great output from Saka in open play given his ability in attacking positions. While Saka ranks joint eighth in the Premier League this season for goals and assists (12), he drops down to 20th for open-play goal contributions (7), below Nottingham Forest’s Anthony Elanga (10) and Tottenham much-maligned forward Richarlison (8), and level with Burnley’s Lyle Foster. Saka’s goal at Fulham at the weekend was his first goal or assist in open play since the win over Wolves on 2 December, seven games ago. Saka did well to get into dangerous positions for the goal to put Arsenal ahead and for another chance after Fulham had taken a 2-1 lead, but he skied that later chance high over the bar when most would have expected him to score, or at the very least hit the target. He has looked ever so slightly out of sorts of late, and his team have as a result, too. Their recent performances may have left Arteta in a quandary. Other managers might consider rotating Saka out and give him a chance from the bench rather than simply hoping he plays his way back into form. The FA Cup tie against Liverpool this weekend could be the perfect opportunity to give Saka a rest that might do him a whole lot of good, particularly with that competition surely not a priority for Arsenal. They have won it four times in the past 10 years, and given they are still in the title race and got a favourable draw in the Champions League round of 16, they should be aiming far higher than another FA Cup triumph. It is worth noting that shortly after Saka was rested for (most of) the West Ham defeat in the EFL Cup, he went on a run of registering an open-play goal contribution in three successive Premier League games (while also adding two goals and two assists in two Champions League matches). That run of three in three aside, he has four open-play goals or assists in his 16 other Premier League appearances this season. So, is Arteta just asking too much of his winger? It’s easy to forget that he is still only 22 years old and yet, since the start of 2020-21, Saka’s first full season as a starter for Arsenal – when he had just turned 19 – only 13 players have played more Premier League minutes (including added time) than him (13,394 minutes). Of those 13, Saka is by a distance the youngest, and only three of them are also attackers – players who are generally substituted off more often. January, with an FA Cup tie next and a winter break that gives Arsenal a 13-day rest before their next match, feels like an ideal time – if ever there was one in this relentless schedule – to give Saka some extended time off. It might hurt Arsenal in the short term but in the long run, it could benefit them. Getting Saka back to his best surely has to be a priority for Arteta, because doing so could get their title hunt back on track. The alternate view is that Arsenal need Saka to return to winning ways and the drop-off in quality to their next-best option is too big to allow him a rest. Also, Arteta may look at his team’s underlying numbers from their recent poor run and suggest things haven’t been as bad as four points from a possible 15 suggest. Over their last five games, Arsenal’s non-penalty expected goals per game has been higher (1.78) than in their first 15 matches of the season (1.57) suggesting they have been creating more. They have gone from an overperformance of 3.71 compared to their xG in their first 15 games to an underperformance of 4.88 in their last five games.  Arteta might reasonably suggest they deserved more from some of those games, and Saka could well have had more open-play goal contributions in that run if he was creating chances for a more natural goalscorer than Gabriel Jesus or Eddie Nketiah, who have eight Premier League goals between them this season. Every other member of the current top six has a single player with more than eight goals on their own, after all. Arteta will say Saka hasn’t been the problem in this recent poor run, and that he is worth sticking with for the important contributions that he continues to make. We’ll just be left to wonder if a break would help because there is no sign that Arteta will let us see what a properly rested Saka looks like. Quite what that means for Arsenal’s season remains to be seen.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

We look ahead to their FA Cup third-round clash with our Sunderland vs Newcastle prediction and preview. FA Cup third-round ties don’t come much bigger than this. This Saturday, the Stadium of Light will play host to the first Tyne–Wear derby (or Wear-Tyne, depending on where you’re from) in almost eight years as Sunderland face Newcastle. It’s the first meeting between these two giant north-east clubs since playing out a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park in the Premier League back in 2016.  It’s fair to say a lot has changed since then.  The Magpies were relegated at the end of that 2015-16 season for just the second time in their Premier League history but managed to come straight up under Rafael Benítez, winning the Championship the following season. They’ve remained in the top-flight ever since, and the Saudi Arabia PIF’s takeover of the club has supercharged their ascent towards the top of English game. While Newcastle were busy winning the Championship in 2016-17, Sunderland toiled in the Premier League and finished rock bottom. They’ve not been back since, and even played four seasons in League One between 2018 and 2022.  Things are looking up for the Black Cats though. After a sixth-placed finish in the Championship last season and subsequent elimination in the play-off semi-finals, they are once again in the promotion hunt. Sunderland currently sit in sixth place and come into this fixture unbeaten in their last three matches. They kicked off 2024 in perfect style with a 2-0 home win against Preston North End. Jack Clarke has been fundamental to their successful campaign to date. The left winger has scored 12 league goals (the next highest Sunderland players have four), a tally only three Championship players can better. Clarke also leads all Sunderland players for overall expected goals (8.8), expected assists (6.1), chances created (59) and successful dribbles per 90 (3.7). If he takes his fine league form into this FA Cup game then new manager Michael Beale can feel confident about his side getting a result against their rivals, who are enduring a difficult campaign. Newcastle come into this fixture amid a horrible run. Eddie Howe’s side have won just one of their last eight games in all competitions, and travel to Sunderland on the back of three consecutive defeats in the Premier League. With a mounting injury list, Howe will want to get to the winter break as soon as possible, but having exited the UEFA Champions League and Carabao Cup while also sitting ninth in the Premier League, it places extra emphasis on the importance of a deep FA Cup run. It could well be their only route back into Europe next season. Reports from the Newcastle camp are that Joe Willock, Harvey Barnes and Elliot Anderson will join Callum Wilson in missing this fixture, as well as the next Premier League game against Manchester City. Kieran Trippier has a chance to play a part after missing the Liverpool game with a groin problem, while Jamaal Lascelles is also fit again and could start after his short appearance at Anfield. The likes of Jacob Murphy, Nick Pope, Matt Targett and Javier Manquillo remain sidelined. Sunderland suffered a handful of fresh injuries over the busy festive period with Niall Huggins sustaining a season-ending knee injury, while Bradley Dack and Patrick Roberts also limped out of recent games and are unlikely to feature here.  Newcastle are winless in their last nine meetings with Sunderland in all competitions (D3 L6, all in the Premier League between 2012 and 2016) since a 1-0 away win in August 2011. It’s their longest ever winless run against their north-east rivals. Sunderland have won their last three home games against Newcastle, and five out of the last six meetings at either ground. They’ve never won four in a row against Newcastle at home.  In the FA Cup, Sunderland have won their last two ties against Newcastle, although this is the first such meeting since a 2-0 quarter-final win in 1955-56. Although they’ve enjoyed good runs in the EFL Cup in the last two campaigns – getting to the final in 2022-23 and the quarter-final this season – Newcastle have not had similar success in the FA Cup. The Magpies have lost their last four FA Cup matches, while they’ve gone out at the third round stage in each of the last three seasons. In their most recent two campaigns, they’ve been eliminated by opponents from a lower division (Sheffield Wednesday in 2022-23 and Cambridge United in 2021-22). That will give Sunderland hope of springing an upset, although the Black Cats have been eliminated from their last four FA Cup ties against Premier League opponents. In fact, when playing in a lower division, they haven’t beaten a Premier League side in the competition since January 2005 (2-1 vs. Crystal Palace). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite their excellent head-to-head record over their bitter rivals, the Opta supercomputer only gives Sunderland an 18.3% chance of beating Newcastle this weekend. The visitors make the short journey to the Stadium of Light with a depleted squad, but the supercomputer believes they still have the quality to progress, with Newcastle winning 61.6% of the 10,000 data-powered simulations of this tie. The draw comes in at 20.1%. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Or is it? Once the setting of Jadon Sancho’s spectacular breakthrough, Borussia Dortmund and the Bundesliga look set to stage his attempted renaissance after a thoroughly underwhelming two and a half years at Manchester United. Sancho’s time at Old Trafford has been mired by accusations of off-field unprofessionalism, inconsistent form on the pitch, a mysterious prolonged absence and a public falling out with manager Erik ten Hag, who banished him from the first-team picture earlier this season. This exile imposed by Ten Hag is essentially the reason Sancho appears to be heading back to Germany, with the pair’s relationship seemingly broken beyond repair. The winger, a product of Manchester City’s academy, will return to Dortmund on loan until the end of the season, when there will likely be more questions asked of his future. Sancho was excluded from Ten Hag’s squad in September and has not featured for the club since. The manager criticised his player’s training performances after leaving him out for the 3-1 defeat at Arsenal, but Sancho responded on social media, calling the comments “completely untrue” and claiming he had “been a scapegoat for a long time” in a post that was subsequently deleted. United announced Sancho wouldn’t be training with the first team “pending resolution of a squad discipline issue”, with media reports at the time suggesting Ten Hag sought an apology before the player would be welcomed back – no such resolution was found. Of course, Sancho returning to Dortmund will no doubt bring happier memories rushing back. It was with BVB that he developed into one of the world’s best young players over a four-year period after leaving City, taking the Bundesliga by storm. It was his third campaign (2019-20) at Signal Iduna Park that lives longest in the memory, when he recorded 33 Bundesliga goal involvements (17 goals, 16 assists). That remains the only season in Opta records (2004-05 onwards) in which a player has recorded at least 15 goals and assists in Germany’s top tier. Sancho was an often-dazzling presence in the Bundesliga. Part of some vibrant, youthful Dortmund sides, his ball-carrying ability coupled with excellent finishing and creative talents made him virtually the complete package in attack. Across the three seasons from August 2018 until June 2021, Sancho’s 77 non-penalty goal involvements saw him rank fifth across the top five European leagues, only behind Lionel Messi (122), Robert Lewandowski (99), Kylian Mbappé (90) and Karim Benzema (79). Such productivity by the age of 21 meant Sancho’s potential looked frightening and United eventually succeeded in luring him back to Manchester in 2021 after chasing him for over two years, paying a reported £73 million for a player they hoped would help transform their fortunes after eight years of underachieving. Since then, United have passed a whole decade without winning the title and this season look about as far away from challenging as ever before in the Premier League era. Obviously this isn’t just down to Sancho, but his disappointing contribution feeds into the wider narrative of United’s underachievement and poor recruitment record in recent times. The fact is he’s not got close to expectations, managing only 15 non-penalty goal involvements in the Premier League for the club. For context, that’s the same as former United player Anthony Elanga, who’s played 680 fewer minutes than Sancho over the same period. But it hasn’t all been bad. There were actually some positive signs in the second half of last season when Sancho returned from several months away from United to overcome “physical and mental” problems; he was back on the pitch at the start of February 2023, and between then and the end of the 2022-23 season, Sancho made some decent strides even if he wasn’t spectacular. His 50 chances created in open play across all competitions in that time was second only to Bruno Fernandes (75) at United and 21 more than any other player (Casemiro, 29). Similarly, his 4.8 xG assisted – the xG value of shots set up by Sancho – in open play for the Premier League season was the second highest in the squad behind Fernandes (14.1) despite him missing a chunk of games. Admittedly, this point highlights how largely disappointing most of United’s creators were last term, but Sancho’s xG assisted figure saw him rank 24th in the entire league and the 23 ahead of him averaged 1,116 more minutes over the campaign. There was still some frustration directed at him; there remained a perception he slowed play down too much, took too many touches and wasn’t direct enough, but considering his situation had been drastic enough that he and the club felt training in a separate environment for a few months was necessary earlier in the same season, it was a decent foundation to build on going into 2023-24. Pre-season also brought with it some eye-catching moments, none more so than his emphatic finish during a 2-0 win over Arsenal, a game in which he generally looked sharp as the focal point in United’s attack. But he was then exclusively a substitute when the season started, and his outlook quickly became bleak with that reaction to Ten Hag’s comments. But have we seen the last of Sancho in a Manchester United shirt? At this point, it’s difficult to jump to conclusions regarding almost anything at the club because of the upheaval they’re currently going through with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS in the process of taking ownership of football operations after purchasing a 25% stake in the club. There are likely to be many changes over the coming months once the Premier League approves the deal, which is expected to happen in February. Those will be personnel and structural changes, with the hiring of a bona fide sporting director likely to be a priority – and that could bring the future of Ten Hag into question. United lost 14 games in all competitions this season before the turn of the year, their worst such record since the 1930-31 campaign. Ten Hag may have enjoyed a promising first term at the helm, but any credit from that has all but evaporated now and it’s by no means implausible to suggest he might not be in charge beyond the summer. Given there appears to be a snowball’s chance in hell of Sancho playing again under Ten Hag, a change of manager looks to be the only realistic chance of reviving his United career – if he even wants to. But just because he’s going back to familiar surroundings doesn’t necessarily mean Sancho will suddenly rediscover the kind of form he enjoyed in his first spell at Dortmund. His output at United has been well off what he produced beforehand in Germany; even if you account for the Bundesliga representing a slight drop-off in general quality, there’s no guarantee Sancho is anywhere near as fruitful as before. At Dortmund, Sancho’s worst expected assists (xA) per 90 minutes over a full season (all competitions) was 0.29 and his worst xG (excluding penalties) per 90 over a full season was 0.25. Both figures are better than Sancho’s best records in the same metrics for United (0.23 xA and 0.22 xG, both in 2022-23).  He also averaged significantly more dribble attempts in Germany, and his 2.2 and 2.3 shots per 90 across his last two seasons at BVB are considerably higher than the 1.4 (2021-22) and 1.3 (2022-23) he’s registered at United. As to the why Sancho’s never got near his Dortmund standards at United, that’s obviously difficult to conclusively pinpoint. Of course, his debut campaign was a turbulent one for the club; the manager who wanted him, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, was sacked after a few months and he was adapting to an entirely new league. The drop-off in his output might have been far greater than anyone expected, but there he was always likely to find the Premier League a little more difficult, particularly in a team that disappointed for most of the campaign. It’s also worth noting that at Dortmund he spent the final year and a half playing in an attack with Erling Haaland, who not only possesses brilliant hold-up abilities that help bring his supporting cast into play, but his finishing talents turn half-chances into goals. Some might argue he can make creators look better than they are. Sure, Sancho played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021-22, but the Portugal great was nothing like Haaland and offered little to the wider team beyond his goals. Dortmund were a cohesive, fluid attacking unit while Sancho was there; United certainly weren’t that in 2021-22. There won’t be a single specific reason behind Sancho’s struggles at United, though. It’ll be a myriad of issues that combined to create the perfect storm. He’ll hope the chance for a fresh start back at Dortmund clears the gloom, and if he does still want to be a success at Manchester United, he just needs to outlast Ten Hag. But even if he does survive the United manager, Sancho has a long road ahead of him if he’s to fulfil the remarkable potential that’s become a mere flicker over the past two and a half years.

The busy festive period always feels like it can make or break a Premier League campaign. The games come thick and fast, so a run of form can drastically change the perception of how any team is doing, while a stumble, stutter, or a full-blown implosion can throw a club into crisis. This Christmas was no different, with three matchdays (minus the postponed Manchester City versus Brentford match) played across 13 days from 21 December 2023 to 2 January 2024. The outlook for many Premier League teams is now really rather different this side of the new year. But which teams had the best and worst festive periods, and who has come out of the recent run of games with their season prospects changed the most? We used numbers from the Opta supercomputer – which ran 10,000 season simulations on 20 December and then did so again on 3 January – to compare how each team’s chances of finishing in each position were affected by the seasonal football. On top of that, who lost key players to injury and suspension? And who is set to be hit the hardest by the absences of the 40 Premier League players heading to the Africa Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup, both of which will be played over five weeks from the end of next week? Here, we look at the biggest winners and losers from the festive period of Premier League football. The only team to take nine points from a possible nine was one that few would have predicted before the festive football kicked off. With wins over Chelsea, Brentford and Everton, Gary O’Neil’s Wolves topped the festive form books. In doing so, they significantly improved their chances of finishing higher up the table. Wolves scored more goals (nine) than any other team during this period, having created chances worth 5.65 expected goals. Their overperformance of 3.35 compared to their xG was almost twice as high as any other team over the festive period, showing just how much confidence there is right now in O’Neil’s squad. According to the Opta supercomputer’s latest round of season simulations, the position in which Wolves are predicted to finish the season is 11th, an improvement of three places from the supercomputer’s predictions before the three most recent games (14th). One other team saw an improvement of three places in the supercomputer’s predictions, with West Ham going from an expected finish of ninth up to sixth. Having beaten Manchester United and Arsenal, David Moyes’ side then ground out a goalless draw with Brighton. The way West Ham play inevitably means opponents will have chances, simply because they concede so much territory. Across their three games, Moyes’ side conceded 6.2 xG, the fourth-highest total of all Premier League teams, and conceded 39 more shots than they had – the biggest negative differential in the top flight. And yet, they were the only team that didn’t concede a single goal during the festive period. Alphonse Areola was a man mountain in the West Ham goal, facing 19 shots on target worth a total of 3.4 expected goals on target – suggesting at least three goals would have been scored against a perfectly average goalkeeper – but he kept three successive clean sheets. The concern for West Ham is just how little they offered in attack against Brighton having lost Mohammed Kudus to international duty with Ghana. There may also be a worry at Wolves that the upcoming international tournaments will bring them crashing back down to earth, with forward Hwang Hee-chan heading to the Asian Cup. He scored twice in the win at Brentford to take his total for the season to 10 Premier League goals, making him the top flight’s sixth-highest scorer. West Ham will also lose Nayef Aguerd, and Wolves will be without Rayan Aït-Nouri and Boubacar Traoré, which will make continuing their recent form a real challenge. Despite only playing two games having had their match against Brentford postponed due to their involvement in the FIFA Club World Cup, Manchester City were in many ways the biggest winners from the festive period. They won their two domestic games and watched Arsenal tumble down to fourth, while Liverpool and unlikely title challengers Aston Villa also dropped points. According to the supercomputer’s latest calculations, City’s chances of retaining the Premier League title rose by 18% over the festive period – the second-highest rise in likelihood for any team to finish in any specific position. Oh, and they became world champions in mid-December, and they are also one of only three Premier League teams who will not lose a single player to either the African or Asian international tournaments that will be played over the coming weeks. It was a good December for Pep Guardiola and co. Fellow title challengers Liverpool won twice and drew to Arsenal, and so saw their chances of winning the league rise from 22.4% to 34.6%. However, any optimism should be tempered by the reality of Mohamed Salah and Wataru Endo heading off for international duty, as well as the serious-looking injuries suffered by Dominik Szoboszlai and Kostas Tsimikas. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Steve Cooper and bring in Nuno Espiríto Santo looks like it might even have paid off already. With back-to-back wins over top-four hopefuls Newcastle and Manchester United, Forest reduced their chances of relegation over the festive period by a bigger margin (15.0%) than any other team. They will, however, lose more players to the Africa Cup of Nations or Asian Cup (six) than any other Premier League team. While two teams improved their expected league finish by three positions, two teams – both of whom lost all of their festive fixtures – saw their expected final position drop by three places. Brentford and Newcastle have both been hit by terrible luck with injuries and look in trouble as a result. Brentford lost heavily to Wolves and then threw away a lead against Crystal Palace to take their total points lost from winning positions for the season to 20 – at least four more than any other team. The saving grace for Thomas Frank’s out-of-sorts side is that they only played twice and therefore have a game in hand to come. The only problem is that game in hand is away to Manchester City, and given they have lost five games in a row, they may not have too much hope of repeating their 2-1 win at the Etihad last season.  They do have Ivan Toney returning from suspension soon but they are going to lose four players – Saman Ghoddos, Kim Ji-soo, Frank Onyeka, Yoane Wissa – to the AFCON and Asian Cup. The position they are expected to finish dropped from 12th on 20 December to 15th on 3 January and they are facing a real challenge to stop the slide. Newcastle, meanwhile, lost three games – to Luton, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool – as their top-four hopes as good as evaporated. The supercomputer now predicts their most likely finish as ninth – down from sixth before the festive games – which, if it were to happen, would represent an incredibly disappointing season for Eddie Howe’s side. They now finish in the top four in just 1% of the supercomputer’s season simulations. The Christmas/New Year period also included a record for Newcastle that they won’t have wanted to break, as Liverpool racked up a higher expected goals total against them (7.11) than any other team has managed on record (since 2010-11) in a Premier League game. However, the biggest losers from the festive games were arguably Arsenal, who saw their chances of winning the title drop by 24.2% \\xad\\xad– a bigger drop than any other team in any specific position in the Premier League. Their title chances are now as low as 4.1% according to the supercomputer after they picked up only one point from their three festive matches. To add to their woes, they also lost Oleksandr Zinchenko to a calf injury and Takehiro Tomiyasu is heading off to the Asian Cup. Mikel Arteta will therefore be short of options at left-back for the coming weeks. Sheffield United made relegation even more likely by taking only one point from a possible nine, and are now given a 68.4% chance of finishing bottom of the table – a rise of 21.8%. They are now almost certain to go down, with the supercomputer giving them a 98.4% chance of relegation. It was an eventful festive period from which we learned a lot about what the end of this season will look like. But then again, so much changed in the space of these three games that the pendulum could swing back the other way for any number of the teams involved. There’s plenty of time for things to change again dramatically yet again. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new\\xa0football newsletter\\xa0to receive exclusive weekly content.

Apologies in advance to Manchester United fans but we couldn’t ignore the increasingly statistically fascinating season witnessed in the red half of Manchester. Erik ten Hag will have wanted to repeat much of what he saw last season, but unfortunately for him, his side has already matched one particular stat from that campaign just 20 games in. Liverpool were very much eager not to repeat their 2022-23 season, and so far they are heading well in the right direction, having won 16 more points at this stage as they did last time out and leading the Premier League heading into the new year. Against Newcastle on Monday night, they added an eye-opening record to their list of achievements. Read on for all that, as well as our latest quiz as we dive into 2024 with another SVQ.

To call Manchester United’s season a “rollercoaster” would be to do it somewhat of a disservice. If anyone had been on a ride as up and down as United’s 2023-24 they would surely be violently ill. That may be how their fans feel after United suffered their ninth defeat of the Premier League campaign at Nottingham Forest on Saturday. To rub salt into the wounds, former winger Anthony Elanga was one of the chief string pullers at the City Ground, providing the assist for Morgan Gibbs-White’s winner. Nicolás Domínguez had given Forest the lead after nice work from Gonzalo Montiel, before Marcus Rashford took full advantage of a Matt Turner error to equalise. Gibbs-White had the final say, though, leading to defeat number nine in the league for Ten Hag’s men. It means that Manchester United have lost as many as nine of their opening 20 league games to a season for the first time since 1989-90. It is also as many as they suffered in the whole of 2022-23, when they finished third in the Dutch coach’s first campaign in charge at Old Trafford. Coming just a few days after their impressive 3-2 comeback victory over title challengers Aston Villa, it was the latest down following an up in a season that has been far wackier than any United fan will have hoped for. Their new year’s resolution will surely be to find more consistency. Their record in the league after 20 games shows them having won 10, lost nine and drawn just one, and that one solitary stalemate was the 0-0 at Liverpool when they faced 34 shots at their goal. Speaking of which… When injury-hit Newcastle United came to town, you wondered if Liverpool might show them some mercy. Instead, they broke the record for expected goals in a Premier League game. Pretty mean, really. Jürgen Klopp’s side did not entirely have things their own way at Anfield in the Premier League’s first game of 2024, with Mohamed Salah seeing a first-half penalty saved, while both teams had goals disallowed for narrow offsides and Alexander Isak equalised for Newcastle shortly after Salah had given Liverpool the lead early in the second half. Sven Botman threw more doubt on the outcome after Liverpool thought they had finished the game off when Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo made it 3-1. It took a successful Salah penalty to finally put Eddie Howe’s men to bed as Liverpool eventually won 4-2 to go three points clear at the top of the table. The hosts should probably have won more comfortably, though it was certainly not for a lack of trying. Liverpool were awarded two penalties, which helped (penalties have an expected goals (xG) value of 0.79), but their total xG of 7.11 was the biggest on record (since 2010-11) by a team in a single game, and by some distance too. The xG model/definition has altered somewhat over the years, which must be borne in mind, but according to Opta data, the next highest total xG from a team in the Premier League on record was Manchester City’s 8-0 win over Watford in September 2019, when they amassed 5.87 xG. That is joint-second with, funnily enough, Liverpool. The Reds put up 5.87 xG in their 6-0 thrashing of Leeds United in February 2022, a game which also featured two penalties for the hosts. It might shock Man Utd fans to learn that their team has the fourth highest, and fairly recently too. United’s 4-1 win against Chelsea in the closing days of last season saw them rack up 5.22 xG, while the fifth entry is back across to City, and their 6-0 hammering of QPR in May 2015. Teams will always prefer actual goals over xG, but it is a useful indicator for how much threat a team created and the extent to which they deserved to win a game. Safe to say, Liverpool just about edged it against Newcastle.

Obviously his 260 goals were stretched over a much greater period than just August 1992-December 1993, but it was then that he got himself out in front and no one has overtaken him since. Teddy Sheringham had been top of the leaderboard for a chunk of 1993 until Shearer went past him, though Shearer had previously also held the lead in the inaugural Premier League season prior to a nasty knee injury. A few pretenders to his crown have threatened to challenge in the intervening years, but Shearer’s record appears safe for a while yet after the summer departure of Harry Kane. At the rate Erling Haaland is scoring, it probably won’t be that long until we’re pondering whether he’ll be the one to knock Shearer off his perch. But the modern-day footballer changes club and/or league so frequently that it’s also not out of the question that Shearer’s record remains intact for decades more. While Shearer is of course most closely associated with hometown club Newcastle, for whom he scored 148 of his Premier League goals over a 10-year period, he also netted 112 in just 138 games for Blackburn Rovers, where he won his only league title in 1994-95. A product of Southampton’s academy, Shearer went home to Newcastle in 1996 and spent the rest of his career at St James’ Park, where he continues to be deified by fans. Has Harry Kane kissed goodbye to his chances of breaking Shearer’s record? There are certainly many who think so since he moved to Bayern Munich in the summer. It’s fair to say, few could blame him for his decision to make such a move; Kane’s had a dire lack of success on a team level for a player so talented, and at Bayern it seems a certainty he’ll win something. But would breaking the Premier League goals record actually have given him a greater legacy? That was the chief counterargument to him moving to the Bundesliga, as he’s only 47 goals behind Shearer. Of course, what’s to say Kane doesn’t enjoy two or three years in Germany and then return to England when he’s 32 or 33? Given his game has never been about raw pace, he presumably stands a good chance of playing well into his 30s just like Shearer. The graphic below, which provides a snapshot of Kane’s trajectory prior to leaving Spurs, certainly suggests he was on course to overtake Shearer. If he were to return to England with Spurs, he could extend the record he currently holds of the most Premier League goals for a single club (213) – Kane also holds the record for most Premier League goals scored in a calendar year (39). Considering he only ever managed 20 or more Premier League goals in a season twice, the fact Wayne Rooney was for a time the second-highest scorer in the competition’s history says a lot about his longevity. But at the same time, it could be argued he began to fade much earlier than would’ve been expected; he left Manchester United in 2017 when he was 31 having scored only 13 Premier League goals in his final two seasons, an output impacted by his conversion to a midfielder that seemingly came about due to no him longer being as reliable or explosive to play up top. Nevertheless, in his prime there were few better all-round footballers in the world, let alone in the Premier League. Rooney could do it all, and he tried to as well. Just as capable of scoring screamers as he was tap-ins, Rooney left an indelible mark on English football, Everton and Manchester United, for whom he is the all-time leading scorer (all competitions) with 253 goals. He’s also scored 74 more Premier League goals for United than any other player. It seems only a matter of time until he’s back in the Premier League as a manager. Another former Man Utd striker, Andy Cole played a prominent role in the club’s finest hour as he was one of four reliable goalscorers they had in the 1999 treble-winning campaign. He netted 93 times in the Premier League for United, just shy of half of his overall output. He also scored for Newcastle, Blackburn, Fulham, Man City and Portsmouth in the competition. In fact, Craig Bellamy (seven) is the only player in Premier League history to score for more clubs than Cole (six). But for many, he’ll be most associated with Sir Alex Ferguson’s brilliant United sides of the mid-to-late 90s and his on-pitch rapport with Dwight Yorke – less so with Teddy Sheringham… A few others may have scored more Premier League goals than Sergio Agüero, but has anyone netted a more iconic one than him? Doubtful. Agüero of course scored the goal that secured Manchester City their first Premier League title in 2012, a dramatic late winner against QPR that also sparked probably the most recognisable commentary in Premier League history courtesy of Martin Tyler. But while that may be Agüero’s most memorable contribution to the Premier League, his influence went much deeper than that. He’s arguably the best goalscorer the Premier League’s ever seen, at least pre-Erling Haaland. The Argentinian’s 184 came at a rate of one every 108 minutes; of players to score 70 or more, his record is comfortably the best, ahead of Thierry Henry (one every 122 minutes). A heart condition forced his early retirement in 2021 shortly after joining Barcelona, but make no mistake, his legacy at City and in the Premier League remains potent. The Premier League’s most prolific midfielder of all time, Frank Lampard became a Chelsea legend across a 13-season spell at Stamford Bridge after signing from West Ham in 2001. It took him a couple of years to really find his niche, but starting in 2003-04, Lampard reached double figures for Premier League goals in 10 successive campaigns. His best season in that respect was 2009-10 when he scored 22 goals in the league. Although that total was second to Didier Drogba’s 29, which remains the most by a Chelsea player in a Premier League campaign, Lampard’s exploits were undoubtedly vital as Carlo Ancelotti’s men won the title. That haul also ensured Lampard became only the third Chelsea player to score 20 or more goals in a single Premier League season after Drogba and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Diego Costa – twice – is the only other player to achieve that for the Blues since. Of course, Lampard did also score eight Premier League goals in a one-year spell with Manchester City in 2014-15, but it was at Chelsea where his impact was the most significant. After an unconvincing season in Italy with Juventus, Thierry Henry also had a difficult start to life in the Premier League after reuniting with Arsène Wenger, the manager who gave him his breakthrough at Monaco. Henry didn’t score in any of his first seven Premier League games for Arsenal, finally breaking his duck against Southampton in match eight on 18 September, 1999. Another barren run lasting over two months followed that, yet he finished the campaign with 17 top-flight goals, a haul bettered by only Kevin Phillips (30), Shearer (23), Yorke (20), Cole and Michael Bridges (both 19). Of course, any criticism of Wenger for parting with a significant sum (£11 million) to land Henry quickly vanished once the young forward found his feet, as he developed into one of the greatest players of his generation and a Premier League legend. From 2001-02, Henry scored at least 24 goals in five successive Premier League seasons and helped the Gunners to two titles, including in 2003-04 as part of the Invincibles. He still holds the record for the most Premier League Golden Boot wins (four). In the early years of the Premier League, Robbie Fowler was one of the competition’s sharpest strikers, scoring as many as 28 in 38 games during the 1995-96 campaign. However, injuries hampered him in the second half of his first spell with the Reds, eventually falling down the pecking order behind Michael Owen and Emile Heskey under Gérard Houllier. Nevertheless, he departed Anfield in December 2001 having scored an impressive 120 Premier League goals in 236 games, moving on to Leeds United and then Manchester City. He returned to Liverpool midway through the 2005-06 season, spending another 18 months at Anfield, scoring eight league goals, his last in the Premier League. After coming through the ranks at West Ham in something of a golden era for the club’s academy, Jermain Defoe went on to enjoy a long career in the Premier League, playing at least once in every season from 2000-01 until 2018-19. The majority of his time was spent at Tottenham, who first signed him from West Ham in February 2004, but much of this four-year spell was spent being rotated with several other high-profile forwards. He eventually departed for Portsmouth in early 2008, reuniting with his former West Ham manager Harry Redknapp, who he would later follow back to Spurs after a reinvigorating 12 months on the south coast. Ninety-one of Defoe’s Premier League goals came for Spurs, but he also went on to make a big impression at Sunderland towards the end of his career, scoring 34 times in 87 top-flight games. Defoe’s last Premier League club was Bournemouth, for whom he scored four times in 28 games. Given he’s 31 and there’s been a fair amount of speculation around his future in the past couple of years, it seems unlikely Salah will ultimately threaten Shearer’s all-time record – though you never know. Nevertheless, his goal for Liverpool in a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace in December 2023 put him in the top 10 – that was also Salah’s 200th goal for Liverpool. He’s since moved on to 153 following a goal against Arsenal on 23 December and two more versus Newcastle on 1 January 2024. With those two strikes against Newcastle, he hit the 150-goal landmark for Liverpool in the Premier League, becoming just the fifth player in the competition to score as many goals for a single club in the competition after Harry Kane for Tottenham (213), Sergio Agüero for Man City (184), Wayne Rooney for Man Utd (183) and Thierry Henry for Arsenal (175). It’s also not implausible that he goes on to surpass Defoe and Fowler before the 2023-24 season is over; he’s got 14 already this term, so a total of 25 for the campaign would take him up to eighth. Salah’s 153 Premier League goals have come at a rate of one every 134 minutes, which is the fourth-best rate among players to score 100 or more times in the competition behind Agüero (108 mins), Henry (122 mins) and Kane (126 mins). He was the fifth-fastest player to reach the 150-goal landmark; with his 247 games behind only Shearer (212), Agüero (217), Kane (218) and Henry (220). It now remains to be seen how deep into the top 10 Salah can get.

West Ham United will welcome fellow European contenders Brighton and Hove Albion to celebrate the new year as the pair meet on Tuesday at London Stadium after two equally impressive Premier League results on Matchday 19. David Moyes managed his first ever away win against Arsenal in all competitions at the 23rd attempt on Thursday as West Ham recorded an unlikely 2-0 victory over Mikel Arteta’s title contenders. Tomás Soucek scored a contentious 13th-minute opener, with referee Michael Oliver and the VAR allowing the goal to stand despite claims the ball had gone out from Jarrod Bowen’s assist – a similar decision to the one Arsenal questioned at Newcastle United earlier in the season – before Konstantinos Mavropanos crashed in a fine second-half header to secure all three points. There was still time at Emirates Stadium for former Hammer Declan Rice to concede a 96th-minute penalty that David Raya saved well from Saïd Benrahma as West Ham – whose late spot-kick miss mattered for little – surged up to sixth in the league table heading into the next round of top-flight fixtures. It was not all positive news in north London, though, as Lucas Paquetá limped off with a first-half hamstring injury, while Nayef Aguerd, Kurt Zouma and Michail Antonio remain absent from Moyes’ lineup. Paquetá will be a huge miss given the Brazilian has been involved in five goals in his last four Premier League home games – as many as in his first 21 appearances at London Stadium (two goals, three assists) – after scoring against Nottingham Forest, assisting once versus Wolves and setting up three as the midfielder tore Manchester United apart. Meanwhile, the latest news suggests that Moyes is likely to be without Ghana’s Mohammed Kudus due to his involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts in Ivory Coast on 13 January. It had been expected that this would be his last game before departing for the tournament, but Ghanian manager Chris Hughton requested he joined up with the squad earlier than planned. Kudus’ nine home goals in all competitions are more than any other club team-mate this season, while the last West Ham player to score 10+ home goals in their first season was Teddy Sheringham in 2004-05. As if denting one north London club’s title hopes was not enough for West Ham, Brighton dealt a similarly impressive blow to Tottenham Hotspur’s early-season top-four chances with a convincing 4-2 victory over Ange Postecoglou’s men at Amex Stadium on Thursday. João Pedro was twice on target from the penalty spot, along with a fine Jack Hinshelwood strike and Pervis Estupiñán’s long-range screamer, as late goals from Alejo Véliz and Ben Davies proved irrelevant. João Pedro is becoming the ever-reliant figure from 12 yards for the south-coast club. He has scored all eight of the penalties he’s taken for Brighton this season after twice sending Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way on MD 19, while he’s netted more from the spot than any other player across Europe’s big five leagues in all competitions in 2023-24. Looking ahead to Tuesday, Roberto De Zerbi’s side, who are eighth in the league table after MD 19, would leapfrog West Ham with a victory at London Stadium, while Brighton are just six points behind Tottenham in fifth – a position that could be enough for UEFA Champions League qualification depending how other English sides fare in Europe this term.  Brighton manager De Zerbi still has a plethora of injury issues mounting, however, with Solly March, Tariq Lamptey, Adam Webster, Simon Adingra, Kauro Mitoma, Joël Veltman, Julio Enciso and Ansu Fati out, while captain Lewis Dunk will serve a one-match suspension after racking up five yellow cards this league campaign. The Seagulls can call upon Danny Welbeck, though, and the striker has scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than he has against any other opponent (six) – but five of his six strikes against them have come in home games. If James Milner plays some part in this match, he’s make his 632nd appearance in the Premier League, moving him level in joint-second with Ryan Giggs in the all-time competition rankings for the most Premier League appearances by players. Gareth Barry still leads the way on 653 apps, a record that Milner could still go on to break. This match will also mean that Milner will play a Premier League match in a 23rd consecutive calendar year, if he’s selected. West Ham won the reverse fixture against Brighton 3-1 in August, ending a 12-game winless league run against the Seagulls (D6 L6) as James Ward-Prowse, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio proved Pascal Groß’s strike irrelevant. Yet since a 6-0 loss in the Championship in April 2012, Brighton are unbeaten in their last six away league games against West Ham (W2 D4), who last did the league double over them in 2011-12 but they’ve never done so in the English top flight. That run without a league double is down to the fact West Ham have struggled in defence against De Zerbi’s side, conceding at least once in all 13 of their Premier League games against Brighton – the most they’ve faced a side without ever keeping a clean sheet in the competition. Home comforts have been aplenty in recent weeks with West Ham winning all of their last three London Stadium games in all competitions, against Man Utd, Wolves and SC Freiburg (in the UEFA Europa League), by an aggregate score of 7-0. West Ham supporters would have to look all the way back to October/November 1994 for the last time their side won four in a row on home soil without conceding within the same season (a five-game run), although Moyes’ men may fancy their chances against an unconvincing Brighton defence. Brighton have kept just three away clean sheets in the Premier League since the start of last season, beating West Ham 2-0 in August 2022, Bournemouth 2-0 in April 2023 and Arsenal 3-0 in May 2023. However, they’ve also only failed to score twice themselves in this run (0-2 v Brentford October 2022, 0-2 v Arsenal December this season) – expect a goal-laden encounter on Monday at London Stadium.

      "Content: s://theanalyst.com/eu/2024/01/west-ham-vs-brighton-prediction/, Tom Patey, West Ham vs Brighton: Prediction and Preview, Both in contention for European qualification once more, we look ahead to Tuesday night’s Premier League clash at London Stadium with our West Ham vs Brighton prediction and preview. West Ham United will welcome fellow European contenders Brighton and Hove Albion to celebrate the new year as the pair meet on Tuesday at London Stadium after two equally impressive Premier League results on Matchday 19. David Moyes managed his first ever away win against Arsenal in all competitions at the 23rd attempt on Thursday as West Ham recorded an unlikely 2-0 victory over Mikel Arteta’s title contenders. Tomás Soucek scored a contentious 13th-minute opener, with referee Michael Oliver and the VAR allowing the goal to stand despite claims the ball had gone out from Jarrod Bowen’s assist – a similar decision to the one Arsenal questioned at Newcastle United earlier in the season – before Konstantinos Mavropanos crashed in a fine second-half header to secure all three points. There was still time at Emirates Stadium for former Hammer Declan Rice to concede a 96th-minute penalty that David Raya saved well from Saïd Benrahma as West Ham – whose late spot-kick miss mattered for little – surged up to sixth in the league table heading into the next round of top-flight fixtures. It was not all positive news in north London, though, as Lucas Paquetá limped off with a first-half hamstring injury, while Nayef Aguerd, Kurt Zouma and Michail Antonio remain absent from Moyes’ lineup. Paquetá will be a huge miss given the Brazilian has been involved in five goals in his last four Premier League home games – as many as in his first 21 appearances at London Stadium (two goals, three assists) – after scoring against Nottingham Forest, assisting once versus Wolves and setting up three as the midfielder tore Manchester United apart. Meanwhile, the latest news suggests that Moyes is likely to be without Ghana’s Mohammed Kudus due to his involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts in Ivory Coast on 13 January. It had been expected that this would be his last game before departing for the tournament, but Ghanian manager Chris Hughton requested he joined up with the squad earlier than planned. Kudus’ nine home goals in all competitions are more than any other club team-mate this season, while the last West Ham player to score 10+ home goals in their first season was Teddy Sheringham in 2004-05. As if denting one north London club’s title hopes was not enough for West Ham, Brighton dealt a similarly impressive blow to Tottenham Hotspur’s early-season top-four chances with a convincing 4-2 victory over Ange Postecoglou’s men at Amex Stadium on Thursday. João Pedro was twice on target from the penalty spot, along with a fine Jack Hinshelwood strike and Pervis Estupiñán’s long-range screamer, as late goals from Alejo Véliz and Ben Davies proved irrelevant. João Pedro is becoming the ever-reliant figure from 12 yards for the south-coast club. He has scored all eight of the penalties he’s taken for Brighton this season after twice sending Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way on MD 19, while he’s netted more from the spot than any other player across Europe’s big five leagues in all competitions in 2023-24. Looking ahead to Tuesday, Roberto De Zerbi’s side, who are eighth in the league table after MD 19, would leapfrog West Ham with a victory at London Stadium, while Brighton are just six points behind Tottenham in fifth – a position that could be enough for UEFA Champions League qualification depending how other English sides fare in Europe this term.  Brighton manager De Zerbi still has a plethora of injury issues mounting, however, with Solly March, Tariq Lamptey, Adam Webster, Simon Adingra, Kauro Mitoma, Joël Veltman, Julio Enciso and Ansu Fati out, while captain Lewis Dunk will serve a one-match suspension after racking up five yellow cards this league campaign. The Seagulls can call upon Danny Welbeck, though, and the striker has scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than he has against any other opponent (six) – but five of his six strikes against them have come in home games. If James Milner plays some part in this match, he’s make his 632nd appearance in the Premier League, moving him level in joint-second with Ryan Giggs in the all-time competition rankings for the most Premier League appearances by players. Gareth Barry still leads the way on 653 apps, a record that Milner could still go on to break. This match will also mean that Milner will play a Premier League match in a 23rd consecutive calendar year, if he’s selected.

Moyes is no stranger to the Theatre of Dreams, having managed the club for a brief period after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Speaking after the final whistle, a grumpy Moyes told reporters: \"No I don't think the scoreline was correct. \"Our [West Ham's] performance was better.\"I am pleased with that but obviously not pleased with different aspects, we didn't finish chances. \"Overall we played better and our performance was better today.\" Rasmus Hojlund scored Man United's first followed by a solid brace from Alejandro Garnacho.

João Pedro is becoming the ever-reliant figure from 12 yards for the south-coast club. He has scored all eight of the penalties he’s taken for Brighton this season after twice sending Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way on MD 19, while he’s netted more from the spot than any other player across Europe’s big five leagues in all competitions in 2023-24. Looking ahead to Tuesday, Roberto De Zerbi’s side, who are eighth in the league table after MD 19, would leapfrog West Ham with a victory at London Stadium, while Brighton are just six points behind Tottenham in fifth – a position that could be enough for UEFA Champions League qualification depending how other English sides fare in Europe this term.  Brighton manager De Zerbi still has a plethora of injury issues mounting, however, with Solly March, Tariq Lamptey, Adam Webster, Simon Adingra, Kauro Mitoma, Joël Veltman, Julio Enciso and Ansu Fati out, while captain Lewis Dunk will serve a one-match suspension after racking up five yellow cards this league campaign. The Seagulls can call upon Danny Welbeck, though, and the striker has scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than he has against any other opponent (six) – but five of his six strikes against them have come in home games. If James Milner plays some part in this match, he’s make his 632nd appearance in the Premier League, moving him level in joint-second with Ryan Giggs in the all-time competition rankings for the most Premier League appearances by players. Gareth Barry still leads the way on 653 apps, a record that Milner could still go on to break. This match will also mean that Milner will play a Premier League match in a 23rd consecutive calendar year, if he’s selected. West Ham won the reverse fixture against Brighton 3-1 in August, ending a 12-game winless league run against the Seagulls (D6 L6) as James Ward-Prowse, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio proved Pascal Groß’s strike irrelevant. Yet since a 6-0 loss in the Championship in April 2012, Brighton are unbeaten in their last six away league games against West Ham (W2 D4), who last did the league double over them in 2011-12 but they’ve never done so in the English top flight. That run without a league double is down to the fact West Ham have struggled in defence against De Zerbi’s side, conceding at least once in all 13 of their Premier League games against Brighton – the most they’ve faced a side without ever keeping a clean sheet in the competition. Home comforts have been aplenty in recent weeks with West Ham winning all of their last three London Stadium games in all competitions, against Man Utd, Wolves and SC Freiburg (in the UEFA Europa League), by an aggregate score of 7-0. West Ham supporters would have to look all the way back to October/November 1994 for the last time their side won four in a row on home soil without conceding within the same season (a five-game run), although Moyes’ men may fancy their chances against an unconvincing Brighton defence. Brighton have kept just three away clean sheets in the Premier League since the start of last season, beating West Ham 2-0 in August 2022, Bournemouth 2-0 in April 2023 and Arsenal 3-0 in May 2023. However, they’ve also only failed to score twice themselves in this run (0-2 v Brentford October 2022, 0-2 v Arsenal December this season) – expect a goal-laden encounter on Monday at London Stadium. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta Player Ratings are something we introduced ahead of 2023-24. For a quick primer on how they’re calculated, you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Jarrod Bowen: 78.6 (out of 100)Mohammed Kudus: 78.3James Ward-Prowse: 74.9Emerson: 71.1Kurt Zouma: 66.5 Pascal Groß: 79.8 (out of 100)Evan Ferguson: 75.1Billy Gilmour: 74.3Jan Paul van Hecke: 71.2Igor Julio: 70.5 The Opta supercomputer predicts a tight clash at London Stadium, with West Ham winning 40.1% of 10,000 data-powered simulations compared to Brighton triumphing in 31.5%. With little to separate these two teams, the data model backs a draw in 28.4% of scenarios prior to kick-off, but Moyes will fancy capitalising on an impressive end to 2023. West Ham are 18 points ahead of where they were at this stage last campaign, reflecting in a top-six finish in the league standings across 44.8% of Opta season simulations this term, while Brighton’s most likely league-table position ranks as seventh – one place higher than their current standing – in 20.6%.

Moyes is no stranger to the Theatre of Dreams, having managed the club for a brief period after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Speaking after the final whistle, a grumpy Moyes told reporters: \"No I don't think the scoreline was correct. \"Our [West Ham's] performance was better.\"I am pleased with that but obviously not pleased with different aspects, we didn't finish chances. \"Overall we played better and our performance was better today.\" Rasmus Hojlund scored Man United's first followed by a solid brace from Alejandro Garnacho. Although West Ham made attempts to score, few were blocked by Andre Onana while the rest did not get close to the target.
